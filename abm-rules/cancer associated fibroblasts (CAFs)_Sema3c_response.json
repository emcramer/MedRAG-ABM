    "## Potential Rules for Sema3c in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Sema3c decreases migration speed. **Justification:** Sema3A, a closely related semaphorin, has been shown to inhibit cell motility in various cell types, including breast carcinoma cells [Document 24]. While Sema3c has not been specifically studied in CAFs, it is reasonable to assume a similar effect based on the shared structure and function of semaphorins. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Sema3c increases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 (pFAK397). **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to stimulate the growth of hippocampal dendrites through integrin-dependent phosphorylation of FAK [Document 24]. This suggests that Sema3c may also influence FAK phosphorylation in CAFs, potentially through a similar mechanism. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Sema3c increases cell-cell adhesion. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to increase integrin expression and cell adhesion in breast epithelial carcinoma cells [Document 24]. This suggests that Sema3c may also influence cell-cell adhesion in CAFs, potentially through a similar mechanism. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Sema3c decreases transformation to activated. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in vivo using xenograft mouse models [Document 24]. This suggests that Sema3c may also inhibit CAF activation, potentially through a similar mechanism. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Sema3c decreases secretion of CXCL12. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to inhibit CXCR4-induced chemotactic and chemoinvasive signaling pathways in breast cancer cells [Document 24]. CXCL12 is a ligand for CXCR4, and its secretion by CAFs can promote tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, Sema3c may also inhibit CXCL12 secretion by CAFs. **Note:** These rules are based on the available information and are speculative. Further research is needed to confirm the effects of Sema3c on CAFs and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. "
