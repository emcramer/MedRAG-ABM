    "## Potential Rules for Thy1 in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases migration and invasion. **Justification:** Thy1 is a commonly used marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to promote tumor cell migration and invasion. [Document 8, Document 10, Document 14, Document 19, Document 22, Document 28, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases ECM remodeling. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) by secreting enzymes that degrade ECM components and by synthesizing new ECM components. [Document 14, Document 17, Document 19, Document 22, Document 28, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of growth factors. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to secrete growth factors that promote tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. [Document 16, Document 17, Document 19, Document 22, Document 28, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of inflammatory cytokines. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to secrete inflammatory cytokines that contribute to tumor progression and immune suppression. [Document 19, Document 28, Document 35, Document 47, Document 51, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of immunosuppressive molecules. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to suppress anti-tumor immune responses by secreting immunosuppressive molecules. [Document 16, Document 19, Document 28, Document 35, Document 47, Document 51, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of MHC class II proteins. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and a subset of CAFs have been shown to express MHC class II proteins, which are typically expressed by antigen-presenting cells. [Document 35, Document 51, Document 68] **Rule 7:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of integrins. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to express integrins that mediate cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. [Document 14, Document 22, Document 27, Document 30, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 8:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of MMPs. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to secrete MMPs that degrade ECM components and promote tumor cell invasion. [Document 14, Document 17, Document 19, Document 22, Document 28, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 9:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of cell cycle regulators. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to promote tumor cell proliferation by secreting growth factors and by altering the expression of cell cycle regulators. [Document 17, Document 19, Document 22, Document 28, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Rule 10:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thy1 increases expression of metabolic enzymes. **Justification:** Thy1 is a marker for CAFs, and CAFs are known to alter the metabolic environment of the tumor by secreting factors that promote glycolysis and by altering the expression of metabolic enzymes. [Document 10, Document 17, Document 19, Document 22, Document 28, Document 35, Document 43, Document 47, Document 51, Document 53, Document 55, Document 57, Document 59, Document 62, Document 66, Document 68, Document 69, Document 71, Document 73] **Note:** These rules are based on the information provided in the documents. However, the specific effects of Thy1 on CAFs may vary depending on the specific tumor type, the stage of tumor progression, and other factors. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Thy1 in CAFs and its implications for cancer development and treatment. "
