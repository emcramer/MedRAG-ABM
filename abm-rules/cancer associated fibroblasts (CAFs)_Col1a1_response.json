[Document 60] **Rule 59:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Col1a1 increases the expression of genes involved in the inflammation pathway. **Justification:** Collagen type 1 (Col1a1) is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its deposition is often increased in tumors. This increased collagen deposition is often associated with the activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which can promote inflammation. [Document 29, 30, 38, 40, 44, 48, 50, 56, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 69, 70, 72, 74] **Rule 60:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Col1a1 increases the expression of genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway. **Justification:** Collagen type 1 (Col1a1)"
