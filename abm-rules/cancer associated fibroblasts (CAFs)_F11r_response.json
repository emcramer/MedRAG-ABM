(Document [1]) **Rule 75:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, F11r decreases secretion of ECM remodeling enzymes from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that macrophages may become less motile upon encountering dead cells, potentially due to phagocytosis or other cellular processes. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of dead cells present in the tumor model. (Document [1]) **Rule 76:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, F11r decreases secretion of immune modulatory factors from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that macrophages may become less motile upon encountering dead cells, potentially due to phagocytosis or other cellular processes. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of dead cells present in the tumor model. (Document [1]) **Rule 77:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, F11r decreases secretion of pro-angiogenic factors from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that macrophages may become less motile"
