Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. ***p \u2264 0.001 using \u0394Ct valuesTo evaluate the effect of COX-2 expression on structural ECM changes, we characterized Col1 fiber distribution in 1 mm-thick fresh tumor slices using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "title": "Deciphering the temporal heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations in breast cancer.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

        "title": "Mechanism of GPER promoting proliferation, migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells through CAF.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that the volume of 4T1 tumors correlated positively with the area of tumor fibrosis. Furthermore, we divided 4T1 tumors according to the degree of fibrosis and characterized the molecular characteristics of the four regions. Finally, the difference in the signaling pathways and sensitivity to 138 drugs was analyzed in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression combined with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The myogenesis, TGF-\u03b2, and Notch signaling pathways were upregulated and the patients with TNBC were significantly differentially sensitive to 25 drugs. The results of in vivo experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumors with high \u03b1-SMA expression was greater than that on 4TO7 tumors with low \u03b1-SMA expression. At the same time, embelin significantly decreased \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA expression in 4T1 tumors compared with the control group.

Our findings add to understanding of CAF distribution in the 4T1 tumor microenvironment and its possible role in treating cancer.HighlightsThe quantitative results of fibrosis showed that the volume of 4T1 tumors correlated positively with the tumor fibrosis.4T1 tumors were divided in the degree of fibrosis and characterized the molecular characteristics of the four regions.The myogenesis, TGF-\u03b2, and Notch signaling pathways were upregulated in TNBC patients who enriched CAFs in tumors.Patients with TNBC were significantly differentially sensitive to 25 drugs.IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involves pathologically deficient expression of progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm).

Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox hazard regression analysis.ResultsAssociations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological characteristics of early breast cancerTMAs from tumours of two different randomised studies on tamoxifen benefit in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal women 18, 19, was subjected to PDGFR\u03b2 IHC analyses and scored as previously described (Figure 1) 10, 11.Tumour stromal PDGFR\u03b2 immunohistochemical staining in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.

No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis.

One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+.

Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

IntroductionBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Clinically, breast cancers are categorized into four subtypes based on their intrinsic characteristics of cancer cells to facilitate targeted therapy. Immunohistochemical determinations of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67 status are used to categorize these tumors. In accordance with the more recent criteria, breast cancers are classified as: (1) luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative); (2) luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%); (3) HER2-enriched (HER2 amplified, ER- and PR-negative); and (4) triple-negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative) subtypes.Prognosis and survival are different depending on these subtypes. Luminal tumors, the most frequent (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses, while HER2-overexpressing and triple-negative tumors are associated with worst prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. For this reason, novel markers to improve prognosis and to decide therapeutic strategies are required.Tumors are complex tissues composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells, including cancer-cells and stromal cells. It is known that characteristics of stromal cells may dictate tumor outcome in breast cancer. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute the principal component of the tumor stroma. CAFs display a high proliferation rate and show capacity to facilitate tumor progression by degrading and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting an angiogenic shift, inducing a metabolic reprogramming toward a reverse Warburg phenotype, or stem cell trait achievement, compared with normal fibroblasts. CAFs promote these actions by the secretion of growth factors and cytokines that influence the epithelium behavior. In this context, CAFs can activate the NF\u03baB signaling pathway to evoke a pro-inflammatory response, and through the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and SDF-1, induce the recruitment of immune cells.In the present study, we have investigated the gene expression of 19 factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas, and their variation after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Those factors were: the calcium-binding protein S100A4, several growth factors (FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, and IGF2), and we also studied inflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL8), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL12), important proteases (uPA, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP11), the nuclear factor NF\u03baB, and the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP1.2. Material and Methods2.1. Patient Selection and Their Characteristics, and Tissue Specimen Handling This study is a non-randomized prospective research which includes 19 women with a histological confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma of luminal type. We selected consecutive cases of T1 or T2 invasive ductal carcinoma of luminal type with sufficient tissue for cell culture, during the period between July 2011 and August 2013, who underwent for a tumor resection as their first therapeutic approach. The exclusion criteria were: prior history of malignant tumor, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, uterine cervix cancer in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of breast cancer, and a history of having received any type of therapy prior to surgery. Table 1 shows characteristics of the 19 patients with invasive breast carcinoma, all included in the analyses performed in this study and classified as luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative) or luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%).During the follow-up period, a total of 6 patients developed distant metastases. The follow-up period was 43 months for patients with recurrence and 58 months for patients without. Women were treated according to the guidelines used in our Institution (Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove). Before the evaluation of tumor samples, all patients gave their written informed consent. The study adhered to National regulations and was approved by the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove Ethics and Investigation Committee.2.2. Cell LinesThe estrogen-independent human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, were both purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).The MCF-7 cell line was cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Lonza, Visp, Switzerland), and the MDA-MB-231 cell line was maintained in high glucose DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, North Darmouth, MA, USA) and the antibiotic mixture 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, Paisley, UK).2.3. Primary Cell Culture Tumor samples were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and enzymatically dissociated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Roche, Hertfordshire, UK) at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h.After enzymatic digestion, the suspension obtained was centrifuged at 400\u00d7 g for 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended and cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin (Gibco), 1 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 5 ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell cultures exhibited, predominantly, fibroblast morphology after three or four passages. Fibroblast culture purity was analyzed by flow-cytometry (Figure 1) using the antibody CD90 clone AS02 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) incubated at 1:50 (4 \u00b5g/mL) for 45 min. After, two washes with PBS 1X, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (FITC, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, ref.: 0103) for 30 min. CD90 clone AS02 antibody specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry before being used on study samples. Also, we analyzed the expression of CD34 (555822, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), which is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors as well as by a multitude of other non-hematopoietic cell types, including epithelial progenitors and vascular endothelial progenitors.2.4. Co-Culture ExperimentsTranswell 24-well plates were used to perform co-cultures of fibroblasts with breast cancer cell lines. Fibroblast cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 104 cells in the bottom of the wells, whereas breast cancer cell lines were seeded (2 \u00d7 104 cells) in the 0.24 \u03bcm pore size tissue culture inserts, which were introduced into the fibroblasts-containing wells later on. Cells were co-cultured for 72 h in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Then, RNA extraction was performed using the following protocol.2.5. Real Time-PCR \u201cRNeasy Mini Kit\u201d (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including the DNAse treatment was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for total RNA isolation. As described previously, the integrity and concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by using a NanoDrop Technologies device, (Wilmington, DE, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the \u201cTranscriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit\u201d (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reverse transcription step was carried out using the following program: firstly, an incubation at 65 \u00b0C during 10 min was performed to ensure denaturation of RNA secondary structures, and then, the reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, 60 min at 50 \u00b0C, and 5 min at 85 \u00b0C.Expressions of different factors were measured using RealTime ready custom panel plates (Roche). These custom-designed plates contained the specific primers and probes for the factors studied and for three reference genes (Table 2). The mRNA levels were measured in a LightCycler 480 II (Roche) with the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 s.The expression was quantified using advanced relative quantification. In this method, the crossing point (Cp) is automatically calculated using the LightCycler software as the first maximum of the second derivative of the curve. A combination of two housekeeping genes (\u03b2-actin and SDHA (Succinate dehydrogenase subunit A)) as a normalization factor was used to minimize sample variability and to increase the accuracy and resolution of gene expression normalization.2.6. ImmunohistochemistryTo study the protein expression of IGF2, immunohistochemistry staining was performed on tissue sections of breast cancer using a TechMate TM50 autostainer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), a primary antibody against IGF2 (ab9574, Abcam, antigen retrieval pH6, incubation 1 h) and the EnVision Detection kit (Dako). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol and permanently coverslipped, as previously described.2.7. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test was used to determine whether sample data were normally distributed. As data were normally distributed, comparison between groups was performed with the Student\u2019s t test. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Differences were considered significant when the p-value \u2264 0.05. The PASW Statistics program was used for all calculations.3. Results3.1. Molecular Profile of CAFsWe determined whether CAFs from luminal tumors presented phenotypic variability at their basal expression of several genes implicated in tumor progression (S100A4, FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, IGF2, IL6, IL8, CCL2, CXCL12, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11, NF\u03baB, and TIMP1). CCL2 and MMP9 gene expressions were significantly higher in CAFs from luminal B tumors compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively, Figure 2). However, we found no significant differences in other pro-tumoral factors between CAFs from these two tumor subtypes.3.2. Molecular Profile of CAFs Co-Culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cell LinesWe next examined the effect of breast tumor cell lines over different CAFs from luminal A or luminal B subtypes. We found different patterns in the expression of pro-tumoral factors depending on the CAF\u2019s luminal type co-cultured with the different cancer cell lines. CAFs from luminal A tumors co-cultured with the luminal cell line MCF-7, showed an increase in VEGFA levels (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A), but a decrease in the gene expression of HGF (p = 0.028), CCL2 (p = 0.028), NF\u03baB (p = 0.046), and MMP-9 (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A). CAFs from luminal B tumors co-cultured with MCF-7 showed a decrease in CCL2 (p = 0.003) and NF\u03baB (p = 0.009) gene expression, while they showed an increased gene expression of other important pro-tumoral factors such as TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.007), CXCL12 (p = 0.013), MMP-2 (p = 0.039) and VEGF A (p = 0.003) (Figure 3B). When CAFs were co-cultured with the triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell line, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increased gene expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA (p = 0.028, for both) (Figure 3C), whereas CAFs from luminal B tumors showed an increased expression in VEGFA (p = 0.003), S100A4 (p = 0.019), TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.004), IL6 (p = 0.049), and IL8 (p = 0.009), but a decrease of NF\u03baB expression (p = 0.028) (Figure 3D). All together, these data suggest that CAFs from luminal B tumors showed, globally, a higher gene expression profile of stromal pro-tumoral factors when co-cultured with any one of these two breast cancer cell lines.3.3. Relationship between CAFs\u2019 Molecular Profile and Development of Distant MetastasisWe also compared the relapse-free survival period with the basal molecular profiling of CAFs. Six patients developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period: two patients with luminal A tumors and four with luminal B tumors. Then, we re-analyzed the gene expression of CAFs comparing those patients developing metastasis with the rest of patients. Interestingly, we found that high IGF2 gene expression (>median) in CAFs was significantly associated with a shortened relapse-free survival (Figure 4A). In addition, higher basal IGF2 gene expression was found in CAFs from metastasic tumors than in CAFs from non-metastasic tumors in all luminal tumors (Figure 4B), and especially, in luminal B tumors (Figure 4C). No significant data was obtained for luminal A tumors due to the low recurrence rate in this population and the small sample size. Finally, we also observed that higher IGF2 gene expression in CAFs from metastatic tumors remained increased after co-culture with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4D,E).In order to confirm the protein expression of IGF2, we stained primary tumors tissue sections and observed the expression by fibroblast (Figure 5). However, we could not analyze all samples (no access to tissue block for all patients) and therefore we could not establish its concordance to metastasis development.4. DiscussionToday, breast tumors are categorized based on cancer cell characteristics for their management. Four main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, HER2\u2212enriched and basal-like) have been established over the last 15 years. Each of these subtypes has different features, clinical behaviors, and treatment response profiles. Luminal tumors, the most frequent type (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. Our results indicate that CAFs from luminal B tumors show more pro-tumor characteristics compared with CAFs from luminal A tumors, which provide evidence of a possible contribution of the stroma to the different biological and clinical behavior between these tumors. Luminal A breast cancers are associated with a most favorable short-term prognosis due to its positive response to endocrine therapy. Luminal B tumors are recognized to have a more aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable prognosis compared with luminal A tumors. In fact, many of the luminal B tumors are ER+/HER2\u2212/high Ki-67. However, expression profiles also classify the ER+/HER2+ tumors as luminal B, and these patients receive a different therapy regimen (that incorporates targeted anti-HER2 therapy) compared to other luminal B breast cancer. In addition, according to the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus, the diagnosis of a portion of patients with the luminal A subtype with poor prognosis was changed to the luminal B subtype, which was determined based on ER positivity, HER2 negativity, Ki67 expression > 14%, and PgR expression < 20%. Thus, luminal B breast tumors (that accounted for nearly 40% of all breast cancers) constitute the most heterogeneous molecular subtype at the clinical and molecular levels. Unfortunately, the immunohistochemistry of the luminal B subtype, based on intrinsic genetics characteristics from cancer cells, remains poorly defined, and it has now become a paramount importance to find new markers capable of segregating luminal tumors into clinically meaningful subgroups that may be used clinically to guide patient management. With this in mind, in the present study, we have tried to identify CAFs populations differing in their pro-tumor capabilities in these luminal tumors.In the present study, we found variability in the gene expression of factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas (Table 1), and after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, depending whether those CAFs are from luminal A or B tumors. CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher gene expression of MMP-9 and CCL2 compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors. These findings are relevant if we consider that MMP-9 (also known as Gelatinase B) is related to tumor invasion and metastasis by its capacity to degrade the type IV collagen found in basement membranes, and to induce angiogenesis. Likewise, MMP-9 has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and/or poor prognostic in patients with breast cancer. On the other hand, CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP1) is a chemokine that exerts a potent chemotactic, stimulatory, and mitogenic effects on mononuclear cells. High levels of CCL2 in the tumor microenvironment, as well as high circulating concentrations of this chemokine, have been associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma patients. CCL2 also stimulates the migration of mammary carcinoma cell lines, and mediates the recruitment of specific monocyte populations that support the establishment of metastatic disease.Especially relevant were our findings showing that different CAFs populations differentially expressed pro-tumor factors depending on co-cultured cancer cell lines. Thus, after co-culture with the luminal cell line MCF-7, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increase in VEGFA levels, but a decreased expression levels of other pro-tumor genes (HGF, CCL2, NF\u03baB, and MMP-9) while CAFs from luminal B tumors although showed decreased levels of CCL2 and NF\u03baB gene expression, but increased gene expression of other important pro-tumor factors like TGF\u03b2, CXCXL12, MMP-2, and VEGF A. Likewise, different patterns of gene expression were found in CAFs from Luminal A tumors, with increased expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA, or CAFs from luminal B tumors, with increased levels of VEGFA, S100A4, TGF\u03b2, IL6, and IL8, but decreased levels of NF\u03baB, after being co-cultured with the cell line MDA-MB-321.In general, CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher expression of pro-tumor factors when co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines, which is in accordance with the fact that these tumors are associated with higher tumor aggressiveness. These overexpressed factors are of importance promoting several biological aspects of tumor progression. TGF\u03b2 is a well-known cytokine that induces malignant mammary epithelial cell to undergo EMT, leading to the acquisition of highly migratory, invasive and metastatic phenotypes. It has been also described that TGF\u03b2 can induce the expression of different proteins, such as growth factors, cytokines, and ECM proteins in CAFs, which promote tumor development in the adjacent epithelium. CXCL12 is a highly pleiotropic chemokine, influencing a variety of biological processes through the interaction with its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7. CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 signaling has been shown to play a role in tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis and bone marrow cell recruitment. In line with this, it has been demonstrated that co-implantation of tumor cells with fibroblasts expressing CXCL12 enhances tumor growth and CXCL12 overexpression has been linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, a number of different agents have been used to block the CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 interaction to inhibit metastasis.MMP-2 (Gelatinase A) together with MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) are related to tumor invasion and metastasis by their special capacity to degrade type IV collagen in basement membrane, and to induce angiogenesis. MMP-2 production increased during the early phase of breast cancer, but also high levels of MMP-2 have been related to poor outcome in breast carcinomas. VEGFA is a potent regulator of angiogenesis and thereby involved in the development and progression of solid tumors, such as breast cancer. S100A4, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein superfamily, has been described as a key player in promoting metastasis, acting as an angiogenic factor, inducing cell motility, and increasing the expression of MMPs. In fact, elevated levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 have been associated with poor patient survival in breast cancer patients and to induce metastasis in rodent models.Interestingly, we have observed high expression levels of IL6 and IL8 in CAFs from luminal B tumors after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells. Previous reports showed that both cytokines are important to maintain the aggressiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly tumorigenic cell line which appears to be devoid of stemness-related features. In addition, clinical studies have showed that both high levels of IL-6 or IL-8 have been associated with breast cancer recurrence. In addition, several strategies to disrupt IL-6 signaling or IL-8 signaling, in vitro or in vivo, significantly reduce tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer cells.Together, these gene expression data may to contribute to a better characterization of tumor stroma of luminal breast carcinomas.Finally, we reclassified the CAFs gene expression analysis considering patients developing or not distant metastasis during the follow-up period. An obvious limitation of the present study is the reduced number of patients who developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period. Nevertheless, and interestingly enough, we have observed that CAFs from metastatic luminal tumors had the highest IGF-2 gene expression, either in basal levels or after being co-cultured with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell lines. These findings seem to be in agreement with previous data revealing that IGF2, which is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of human cancers, is associated with more aggressive tumors and with a poor prognosis. IGF-2 promotes excessive growth and anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. In fact, it has been shown that IGF-2 signaling is important to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In addition, IGF-2 has been recently implicated in a positive feedback circuit as a critical mechanism to increase stemness and maintain breast cancer cells. More importantly, it has been suggested that CAFs derived from breast metastatic tumors have increased protumorogenic properties due to the increased expression of IGF2. On the other hand, there are several lines of evidence linking IGF signaling and luminal tumors. In one large follow-up study on breast cancer in postmenopausal women, serum levels of IGF-2, but not IGF-1, were positively associated with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer risk. Likewise, it has been reported that both the co-expression and interactions of IGF1R (receptor for IGF-1 and IGF-2) and ER signaling systems suggest a role for the IGF1R network in the resistance to endocrine therapy. It is also remarkable that IGF-2 is known to play an important role during fetal growth and development, and its expression in malignant tumors might implicate a more primitive cellular phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that IGF-2 expression may be a potential useful marker of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in luminal tumors.In summary, our data may contribute to a better biological characterization of the interaction between cancer cells and tumor stroma in luminal breast carcinomas. In this way, our results allow us to consider that, among the complex array of soluble factors produced by CAFs, it could arise possible new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for luminal breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization: N.E., M.F., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Data curation: N.E., M.F., J.R.C., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Formal analysis: N.O., S.C., M.F., and L.O.G.; Investigation: N.E., S.C., and M.F.; Methodology: N.E. and S.C.; Project administration: N.E. and F.J.V.; Resources: L.O.G. and F.J.V.; Writing\u2014original draft: N.E., S.C., M.F., and F.J.V; Writing\u2014review & editing: N.E., J.R.C., and F.J.V.

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent one of the most abundant cell types within the breast cancer stroma. Here, we aimed to explore the influence of CAFs on breast cancer gene expression, as well as on invasion and angiogenesis. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of several cancer progression related genes (S100A4, TGF\u03b2, FGF2, FGF7, PDGFA, PDGFB, VEGFA, IL-6, IL-8, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11 and TIMP1) in the human breast cancer-derived cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, before and after co-culture with CAFs. Stromal mononuclear inflammatory cell (MIC) MMP11 expression was used to stratify primary tumors. In addition, we assessed the in vitro effects of CAFs on both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion and endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation. We found that the expression levels of most of the genes tested were significantly increased in both breast cancer-derived cell lines after co-culture with CAFs from either MMP11+ or MMP11- MIC tumors. IL-6 and IL-8 showed an increased expression in both cancer-derived cell lines after co-culture with CAFs from MMP11+ MIC tumors. We also found that the invasive and angiogenic capacities of, respectively, MDA-MB-231 and HUVEC cells were increased after co-culture with CAFs, especially those from MMP11+ MIC tumors. Our data indicate that tumor-derived CAFs can induce up-regulation of genes involved in breast cancer progression. Our data additionally indicate that CAFs, especially those derived from MMP11+ MIC tumors, can promote breast cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

Although a few targeted therapies such as inhibitors of PARP or immune checkpoints are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Existing therapies for TNBC are largely ineffective due to drug resistance that eventually leads to relapse and metastasis within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Therefore, alternative treatment approaches are imperative to improve outcomes for TNBC patients. Recent evidence suggests that besides alterations in cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interactions with cancer cells (i.e., tumor-stromal interactions) promote drug resistance and disease progression. Using the TME as a therapy target has gained momentum particularly for aggressive cancers such as TNBC that have a rich stroma and limited targeted therapies.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant stromal cells in the TME of TNBC. CAFs secrete paracrine signaling molecules that interact with cancer cells and promote tumor growth, drug resistance, and eventually metastasis. Recognizing the role of stroma-derived paracrine factors in tumorigenesis, several drugs are in clinical trials to target either CAFs, its secreted factors, or their corresponding receptors expressed on cancer cells. Despite progress in understanding the TME, identifying effective drugs against tumor-stromal interactions remains difficult. Typically, animal models and cell cultures are used for both mechanistic studies and testing drugs in preclinical stages. Animal models lack most, if not all, of human stroma and are incompatible with screening multiple compounds and dosing regimens needed in drug discovery. Monolayer cell cultures allow high throughput compound screening but lack the native architecture and components of tumor stroma and poorly predict drug responses in vivo. To address this technological gap, three-dimensional (3D) tumor models have been developed to recreate tumor-stromal interactions, including co-culture spheroids of cancer-stromal cells with or without ECM and microfluidic devices with tumor and stromal compartments. These models either do not recreate the spatial distribution of different components of the TME or are incompatible with automated platforms for drug screening. Emerging organoid technologies partially address these shortcomings, with major caveats that include the long time needed to develop them and challenges to incorporate stromal cells.We recently developed a 3D organotypic TNBC model that contains key components of the breast TME, i.e., a mass of cancer cells, activated fibroblasts, and ECM, and is compatible with automated liquid handling operations. Here, we leveraged this model and established that CAFs and TNBC cells predominantly communicate via HGF-MET paracrine signaling, activating several oncogenic pathways while promoting invasiveness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells. We also found that HGF-MET signaling was highly active in a lung stromal environment and promoted colony formation by TNBC cells. We identified drug combinations that significantly blocked stroma-mediated tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells.Materials and MethodsCell cultureMDA-MB-231, SUM159, Hs 578T, MDA-MB-157, HCC1806, and BT-20 TNBC cells and WI-38 lung fibroblast cells were purchased from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells were transduced to stably express GFP. Three different breast fibroblast cells were used: normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein (gift of Dr. Daniel Hayes, University of Michigan), CAFs derived from a human breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-1) and obtained from Neuromics (Cat. No. CAF06), and CAFs derived from an invasive ductal breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-2) and obtained from BioIVT (Cat. No. HPCCAFBR-05). CAFs were cultured as recommended by the vendors for up to five passages. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, Hs 578T, and HMF cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). HCC1806 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma), 2 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic. WI-38 cells were cultured in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. Cells were plated in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and kept in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested frequently for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. No further authentication was performed for ATCC cell lines. After about 25 passages, the cells were replenished with fresh cultures from frozen stocks.Human phospho-RTK arrayA human phospho-RTK array (R&D Systems, Cat. No. ARY001B) was used to detect relative phosphorylation of 49 different RTKs on TNBC cells post-stimulation with conditioned media of CAF cells. TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) were stimulated for 10 min with conditioned media from confluent cultures of CAFs (CAF-1 and CAF-2). For a negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed using lysis buffer 17 containing protease inhibitors (Aprotinin, Leupeptin, and Pepstatin). Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each array was blocked for 1 h with array buffer 1 and incubated with 300 \u03bcg of protein lysate overnight at 4\u00b0C. The array was washed and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-phospho-tyrosine detection antibody and developed using FluorChem E imaging (ProteinSimple). The relative phosphorylation of each RTK in the blot array was quantified by measuring pixel densities of the corresponding pair of dots on the array in ImageJ and normalized with respect to its vehicle control.Bead-based multiplex immunoassayConditioned media from confluent monolayer cultures of HMF, CAF-1, CAF-2, and WI-38 cells were collected from an overnight incubation. Concentrations of secreted factors were quantified using a magnetic bead panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HAGP1MAG-12K) for HGF, FGF-1, FGF-2 and another panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HCYTA-60K) for EGF and PDGF-AB/BB. Briefly, each conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove debris. Then, the supernatant was incubated with the premixed antibody-immobilized beads overnight at 4\u00b0C on a titer plate shaker. The beads were washed carefully three times with a wash buffer using a handheld magnet (Millipore, Cat. No. 40-285) to retain the magnetic beads in the well plate. Next, the beads were incubated with a detection antibody followed by addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from the beads was measured using a Luminex MAGPIX instrument. Standard curves were generated to determine concentrations of the soluble factors.Organotypic tumor model and imaging of TNBC cell invasionThe organotypic tumor model was formed in two robotic micropatterning steps using an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) technology with 5.0%(w/v) polyethylene glycol and 6.4%(w/v) dextran. First, 7.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells were microprinted in a nanodrop to form a spheroid in each well of a 384-well plate. Then, a drop containing 20 \u03bcl ice-cold rat tail type I collagen solution (Corning) and 1.5\u00d7104 suspended fibroblasts was dispensed into each well. The 384-well plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to form the tumor model with fibroblasts dispersed in a collagen gel containing a mass of TNBC cells. For confocal imaging, the tumor models were formed in a glass bottom 384-well plate (MatTek, Cat. No. PBK384G). Images were captured with a 10X objective on days 1 and 5 of culture (Nikon A1). TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Z-projected images were constructed from images of samples acquired with a z-spacing of 20 \u03bcm. NIS software was used for image acquisition and Fiji (ImageJ, NIH) was used for image analysis and 3D reconstruction. The total pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with CAF-1 or CAF-2 was normalized to the pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with HMF. Unlabeled collagen fibers were imaged using confocal reflectance microscopy.Flow cytometryTo quantify the proliferation of TNBC cells in organotypic models 5 days after formation, the collagen matrix was digested using collagenase I (Sigma) and mechanical agitation for 15 min. Collagenase activity was neutralized by adding triple amounts of complete growth medium. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was suspended in 300 \u03bcl of medium and then 50 \u03bcl of suspension of counting beads (CountBright, Invitrogen) was added. Cells were analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. At least 103 counting bead events were acquired while running each sample. Non-fluorescing TNBC cells were used to remove the background fluorescence. The GFP+ TNBC cells were gated from unstained fibroblasts. The absolute TNBC cell number was obtained as (number of TNBC events/number of bead events) \u00d7 number of beads.Quantitative PCRCells were harvested from organotypic cultures and lysed using a Total RNA Kit lysis buffer (Omega BioTek). The lysate was passed through homogenizer mini columns (Omega BioTek). Total RNA was obtained using an RNA isolation kit (Omega BioTek). After removing DNA using RNase-free DNase (Omega BioTek), purity and concentration of isolated RNA were assessed using optical density (OD) 260/280 spectrophotometry (Synergy H1M, BioTek Instruments). cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using random hexamer primers (Roche). Real-time qPCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 instrument II using a SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche). After combining 50 ng of cDNA with the primer and the SYBR Green Master Mix to a final volume of 15 \u03bcl, the reactions were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification, that is, at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, at 60\u00b0C for 10 s, and at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The primer sequences for the genes are listed in Table S1. Gene expression values were calculated relative to \u03b2-actin and GAPDH using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. mRNA fold change was determined from the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.Western blottingOrganotypic cultures were treated with collagenase I for 15 min with added mechanical agitation. The collagenase activity was neutralized using triple amounts of complete growth media. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer containing 1% protease inhibitors and 1% phosphatase inhibitors. For stimulation experiments, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were stimulated for 10 min with CAF-1 and CAF-2 conditioned media with or without crizotinib (0.5 \u03bcM or 1 \u03bcM). For negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested using RIPA buffer. The cell suspension was further sonicated twice at a 20% amplitude for 5 sec (Vibra-Cell, Sonics). A BCA protein quantification assay was used to measure total protein concentration from each sample, which was then loaded onto a 4-15% gel (Bio-rad) for electrophoresis. Each gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk prepared in wash buffer for 1 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9101), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9102), phospho-Akt (Ser473, Cat. No. 4060), Akt (pan, Cat. No. 4691), phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705, Cat. No. 9145), Stat3 (Cat. No. 4904), E-Cadherin (Cat. No.14472), N-Cadherin (Cat. No. 13116), Vimentin (Cat. No. 5741), phospho-Met (Tr1234/1235, Cat. No. 3077), Met (Cat. No. 8198), and GAPDH (Cat. No. 5174), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The membranes were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection was done using ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) with FluorChem E system.Drug treatments of TNBC spheroidsInhibitors of MAPK (trametinib, ulixertinib, SCH772984) and PI3K/Akt (dactolisib, apitolisib, VS-5584) were purchased from Selleckchem. Dactolisib was dissolved in dimethylformamide and all other compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The compounds were used at 1\u00d710\u22124 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 5\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22122 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22121 \u03bcM, 1\u00d7100 \u03bcM, and 1\u00d7101 \u03bcM against free floating spheroids of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells. Untreated spheroids were kept in culture media. After 4 days of drug treatments, the GFP signal from TNBC cells was measured using a plate reader and the fluorescent signal was normalized to that from the vehicle control spheroids to construct dose\u2013response curves (GraphPad Prism) and calculate LD50 values.Cyclic treatment regimenTo model resistance of cancer cells to monotherapies, MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids at a 1:1 ratio were cyclically treated with 5 nM (i.e., 0.5\u00d7LD50) trametinib for 28 days. Each experiment included four cycles of treatment (T1, T2, T3, T4) each followed by a recovery phase (R1, R2, R3). Phase images were captured at the end of each cycle to approximate the volume of spheroids. The GFP signal from TNBC cells was normalized to that from day 0 to calculate a percent viability. A growth rate metric (kc), defined as the difference in the volumes of spheroids after and before each treatment divided by 4 days treatment, was used to quantify trametinib resistance.Combination treatments of organotypic culturesOrganotypic cultures were treated with crizotinib/trametinib or crizotinib/dactolisib combinations prepared in culture medium with 1% FBS. Each inhibitor was used at five concentrations, 0.1 \u2013 50 nM for trametinib and dactolisib, and 1 \u2013 5 \u03bcM for crizotinib, which were selected based on dose-responses of free-floating spheroids of the cells. Single-agent treatments with trametinib and dactolisib were also carried out, resulting in a 6\u00d76 matrix of concentration pairs, each with four replicates. Treatments were renewed after 72 h. Confocal images of the cultures were captured on day 5. The area occupied by TNBC cells was measured, normalized with the respective vehicle control, and represented as an invasion area to quantify the effect of each treatment. The fraction of cells affected by each treatment was calculated as 1-invasion area. A synergy analysis was performed to generate a combination index (CI) for pairs of drugs.Colony formation assay and immunofluorescence imaging of proliferative cellsTNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM159, Hs 578T), with or without WI-38 lung fibroblast cells, were seeded as a single cell suspension in a 1.2% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sigma) gel made using 1% FBS-containing medium. A 1:4 ratio of TNBC:WI-38 cells was used and each well of a 384-well plate contained 50 TNBC cells and 200 WI-38 cells. Culture medium with 1% FBS was replaced every 3 days. The cultures were treated with 0.5 \u03bcM crizotinib and maintained for 8-10 days to image the colonies. The TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM prior to imaging at a 2.5X magnification. An in-house python code in ImageJ was used to automatically detect the colonies in each image and compute their areas. A threshold colony diameter of 75 \u03bcm was used for statistical analysis. The TNBC colonies were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 3% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were incubated overnight with a Ki-67 rabbit antibody in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (Cell Signaling, Cat. No. 9027). Samples were washed and incubated with a rhodamine red donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100, Cat. No. 711-295-152) for 1h and imaged. Ki-67+ cells were counted per TNBC colony and Ki-67/colony area ratios were normalized to the average in the respective vehicle control group, i.e., TNBC cells without WI-38 cells and crizotinib treatment.Bioinformatics analysis of data from breast cancer patientsThe mRNA expression data from 2509 publicly available cases of invasive breast carcinoma were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, METABRIC dataset), using cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). A query was performed to analyze co-expression of EGFR and MET genes. Co-expression of EGFR and MET proteins was also analyzed using protein expression data from the Firehose legacy breast cancer dataset (TCGA). The activities of p-EGFR and p-MET were determined from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) available through MD Anderson Cancer Center.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene expression data of GSE138139 was downloaded from the GEO database. For GSEA, the number of permutations was set to 1,000. The platform of this dataset is the GPL1261 Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. The enrichment score was calculated according to metastasis status (lung metastasis versus parental breast cancer cells). Differences of a nominal p<0.05 and an FDR less than 25% defined significance.Statistical analysisData were first checked for normality using the Anderson-Darling method in MINITAB. For normally-distributed data, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparisons was used to compare means among three or more samples. A two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to compare two experimental groups. Normally-distributed data from experiments were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Non-Gaussian distributed data were analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Values of p<0.05 denoted statistical significance.Data availabilityThe data generated in this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Data file.

While both TNBC cells had high basal EGFR activity, stimulation with CAFs significantly activated MET. CAF-1 led to 25 and 30-fold increase in pMET levels and marginally affected pEGFR by 0.7 and 1.5-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively (Fig. 1b). CAF-2 also increased pMET by 3.7 and 5.5-fold and minimally changed pEGFR by 0.8 and 1.3-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively. Thus, CAFs predominantly activated MET in TNBC cells. To further validate this finding, we treated six different TNBC cells with conditioned media from the CAFs and found significant activation of MET in all six TNBC cells by CAF-1 and in five of the TNBC cells by CAF-2 (Fig. 1c\u2013d). Despite MET protein expression in the TNBC cells (i.e., high t-MET levels), paracrine signaling with CAFs activated it (i.e., p-MET) (Fig. 1c). We ensured that MET activation was indeed due to paracrine signaling with CAFs using an immunoassay that showed both CAFs secrete high levels of the MET ligand, HGF, i.e., ~10.2 ng/ml by CAF-1 and ~1 ng/ml by CAF-2 (Fig. 1e). In contrast, HMFs secreted only 50 pg/ml of HGF. Other soluble factors such as EGF, FGF-1 and FGF-2, and PDGF AA/AB were not detectable. Taken together, these results indicate that CAFs from patients secrete HGF and predominantly activate MET in TNBC cells.CAFs activate multiple oncogenic pathways in TNBC cellsActive RTKs regulate various signaling pathways that drive breast cancer progression. We evaluated activities of several prominent pathways in breast cancers including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT. While MDA-MB-231 cells had basal MAPK/ERK activity due to an activating mutation in K-Ras, CAF-1 led to activation of both Akt and STAT3, whereas CAF-2 only activated Akt (Fig. 2a). In SUM159 cells that had basal PI3K/Akt pathway activity due to a mutation in PI3K, both CAFs activated ERK and STAT3 signaling (Fig. 2a). CAF-1 had a greater effect in activation of these pathways than CAF-2 because of its higher HGF production that led to significantly higher MET activation in TNBC cells (Fig. 1c\u2013d). To validate the role of HGF-MET signaling in activating these pathways, we used a MET inhibitor, crizotinib, against TNBC cells stimulated with CAF-1. We selected only CAF-1 for this experiment because of its greater effect on promoting oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells. This treatment led to a dose-dependent significant reduction in activation of ERK, Akt, and STAT3 in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Fig. 2b). Overall, these results established that CAFs promote several downstream pathways in TNBC cells through HGF-MET signaling.MET expression and activity in patient tumorsTo determine the clinical relevance of MET in TNBC, we analyzed MET gene expression in different breast cancer subtypes in TCGA. Basal and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, which primarily represent TNBC, showed significantly higher expression of MET than other subtypes (Fig. 3a). We also found a moderate, but significant correlation between MET and EGFR at both gene and protein levels (Fig. 3b). To determine functional activities of MET and EGFR in breast tumors, we analyzed data for invasive breast carcinomas and found a significant correlation between p-MET and p-EGFR (Fig. 3c). This analysis of data from patient tumors underlines the significance of MET activity in TNBC, and together with our results, suggests a critical role for CAFs to predominantly activate MET in EGFR+ TNBC cells.CAFs promote pro-metastatic functions in TNBC cellsOur organotypic tumor 3D model mimics the architecture and positioning of cancer and stromal cells in solid tumors. The model has a matrix stiffness of ~2.5 kPa as in human breast tumors (Fig. 4a). Using this model, we studied the role of CAFs on matrix invasion of TNBC cells. We found that unlike HMF cells, CAF-1 and CAF-2 promoted ECM invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells by up to ~2.5-fold (Fig. 4b\u2013c). Furthermore, our analysis of organotypic models showed that both CAFs promoted proliferation of the TNBC cells by up to ~1.3-fold within 5 days (Fig. 4d\u2013e).Due to the role of EMT in local invasion of cancer cells and metastasis, we investigated whether CAFs promote an EMT phenotype in TNBC cells. Invading TNBC cells in organotypic models containing CAF-1 or CAF-2 displayed a significantly more elongated morphology compared to those with HMF cells (Fig. 5a). To validate this result, we quantified gene expression of several EMT transcription factors. Co-cultures with CAF-1 and CAF-2 upregulated most EMT markers in TNBC cells (Fig. 5b). CAF-1 enhanced expression of SLUG and FOXC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL and ZEB2 in SUM159 cells by more than 3-fold. CAF-2 also increased expression of SLUG and FOXC2 by nearly or more than 2-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL in SUM159 cells by over 2-fold. We further validated these results and showed that stimulation with CAF-1 conditioned medium led to elevation of vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and N-cadherin in SUM159 cells (Fig. 5c). CAF-2 cells did not induce a detectable change in these proteins in the TNBC cells. Overall, these results indicate that CAFs shift these mesenchymal-like TNBC cells further toward a mesenchymal phenotype.Modeling resistance of TNBC cells to single-agent treatmentsFrequent emergence of drug resistance to monotherapies in solid tumors typically necessitates combination therapies to increase treatment efficacy and durability. Next, we asked to what extent single-agent targeting of constitutively-active oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells would lead to drug resistance and a potential function of HGF-cMET signaling in drug resistance. To select drug compounds for these experiments, we used TNBC spheroids and performed a dose-dependent screening of a set of molecular inhibitors against MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. S2). Our quantitative analysis showed that the most effective inhibitors were trametinib against MDA-MB-231 cells with an LD50 of 10 nM and dactolisib against SUM159 cells with an LD50 of 1 \u03bcM. Then, we treated MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids with trametinib in a cyclic regimen to mimic intermittent chemotherapy cycles (Fig. 6a). Trametinib reduced the size of spheroids during the first two treatment rounds (T1 and T2) (Fig. 6b) and reduced cancer cell viability to 41% at the end of T2 (Fig. 6c). However, after the second recovery round (R2), trametinib became significantly less effective. At the end of the 28-day regimen, spheroids treated with trametinib were 3.04-fold larger than those after T1 and the GFP fluorescence intensity of the MDA-MB-231 cells, i.e., an approximate measure of number of cells, increased by 3.11-fold compared to that after T1. We used a growth rate metric (kc) to quantify the treatment effect (Fig. 6d). Although kc for the spheroids reduced during T1 and T2, it significantly increased during T3 and T4. The kc values of spheroids from T1 to T4 increased from \u22120.0059 mm3/day to 0.0172 mm3/day. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we evaluated activation of ERK, Akt, and MET following T1 and T3 treatments (Fig. 6e). Trametinib treatment reduced pERK and pMET levels but upregulated pAKT during T1. Following T3, there was significant activation of ERK and MET and persistent activity of Akt. These findings suggest feedback signaling between PI3K/Akt and MAPK/MEK pathways and gain of MET activity to drive ERK signaling as potential mechanisms of trametinib resistance of TNBC cells.Combination treatments to suppress tumorigenic activities of TNBC cellsNext, we evaluated the feasibility of a combination treatment strategy to simultaneously suppress proliferation, invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in organotypic cultures. Because HGF from CAFs activated MET in TNBC cells, we hypothesized that treatments blocking the HGF-MET axis and its downstream pathways could potentially inhibit tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells. To test this hypothesis, we selected a combination of inhibitors of MET and MAPK pathway for MDA-MB-231 cells and MET and PI3K/Akt pathway for SUM159 cells and performed matrix-style combination treatments. This selection reflects different constitutively active kinase pathways in the TNBC cells, i.e., MAPK pathway in MDA-MB-231 and PI3K/Akt pathway in SUM159 cells (Fig. 2a). We used CAF-1 for these experiments because it had a greater effect on promoting invasion, proliferation, EMT, and oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells than CAF-2.Representative images of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells in organotypic cultures under single-agent and combination treatments and the quantified inhibition of invasion are shown in Fig. 7a\u2013d. While each compound alone reduced cancer cell invasion, the combination treatments more effectively inhibited invasion at low concentrations. With the organotypic cultures of MDA-MB-231, trametinib/crizotinib up to and including the 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair showed significantly greater effects than the individual drugs. The 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair synergistically reduced cell invasion by 93% and resulted in CI=0.34. With the organotypic cultures of SUM159, crizotinib/dactolisib up to and including the 1 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM pair were more effective than each compound alone with the combination blocking SUM159 cell invasion by up to 96% with a CI = 0.39. Although the drug combinations also reduced MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cell proliferation in organotypic models by 1.76-fold and 2.0-fold (Fig 7e\u2013f), respectively, results suggest that TNBC proliferation was primarily driven by the constitutive pathway in each TNBC cell line because reduction in proliferation was mainly realized using the respective inhibitor of each pathway rather than crizotinib.Next, we studied inhibitory effects of the treatments on downstream signaling pathways. The crizotinib/trametinib pair downregulated activities of MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly greater than those from the respective responses when each compound was used alone (Fig. 7g). Additionally, it significantly reduced expression of various EMT gene and protein markers (Fig. 7h\u2013i). With SUM159 organotypic cultures, the dactolisib/crizotinib pair also significantly reduced activities of the three signaling pathways (Fig. 7j) and EMT markers (Fig. 7k\u2013l). Overall, these results provide compelling evidence that the selected combinations treatments effectively block CAFs-mediated pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells by simultaneously blocking signaling activities in multiple prominent oncogenic pathways.HGF-MET pathway promotes TNBC survival and colony formation in lung stromaDue to the prevalence of TNBC metastasis to lung, we asked whether HGF-MET pathway has a role in supporting TNBC cell survival and colony formation in the lung. We used a Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection and derived 14 MET signature genes based on their association with activated MET. Our analysis of results from a study of a murine metastasis model of human TNBC showed that these genes were significantly enriched in lung metastasis (Fig. S3a). This was consistent with other studies that showed lung stromal cells secrete high levels of HGF. To investigate functional effects of HGF-MET signaling in lung stroma, we used WI-38 lung fibroblast cells to determine to what extent they impact colony formation of TNBC cells. First, we validated that WI-38 cells activate MET receptors in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells (Fig. S3b). We ensured the specificity of this activity by analyzing the secretome of WI-38 cells and found that these cells secrete ~7.2 ng/ml of HGF (Fig. S3c).To study the role of lung fibroblasts in survival and proliferation of TNBC cells, we developed a 3D lung stromal environment consisting of a methylcellulose hydrogel and dispersed WI-38 cells. The hydrogel also contained single TNBC cells to represent metastatic cells. We used four different TNBC cell lines at a 1:4 ratio to WI-38 cells to mimic the relatively small population of cancer cells compared to the resident stromal cells in metastatic sites. Results showed that WI-38 cells significantly promote colony formation of SUM159, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-157 cells by 1.61, 4.0, and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig. S3d). We validated that this response was indeed due to the HGF-MET pathway by showing that crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of all three TNBC cells (Fig. S3d). Immunofluorescent staining of the cultures also showed a significant increase in Ki-67+ TNBC cells, which was reversed by blocking the HGF-MET axis (Fig. S3e). We note that WI-38 cells did not increase colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with a study that showed formation of MDA-MB-231 lung micrometastases significantly larger than our selected threshold to quantify colonies requires a much longer time than we used. Collectively, these results demonstrate that lung fibroblasts provide a permissive niche for survival and metastatic colonization of TNBC cells via the HGF-MET axis and suggest that blocking this pathway may provide benefits against both primary TNBC and lung metastasis.DiscussionTNBC is a heterogeneous disease that presents six different subtypes with significant activities of RTKs and downstream Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Although PARP and immune checkpoint inhibitors are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay treatment. Thus, disrupting tumor-stromal interactions may provide new targeted therapies for TNBC. We developed an organotypic tumor model to mechanistically study interactions of TNBC cells with patient-derived CAFs. Patient-derived CAFs predominantly secreted HGF, consistent with studies that showed CAFs in breast tumors produce as high as 50 ng/ml of HGF. However, CAFs from different patients showed a significant difference in HGF production due to inter-tumoral heterogeneity that is a characteristic of CAFs in breast tumors (Fig. S4). Although several reports have shown that breast cancer cells can produce HGF to activate MET in an autocrine signaling manner, we did not detect HGF in supernatants of TNBC cells. Furthermore, all six TNBC cell lines used had endogenous MET expression, in agreement with data from human breast tumors showing significantly higher MET gene expression in basal and claudin-low subtypes compared to other breast cancers (Fig. 3). Other studies have shown that MET is frequently overexpressed in malignant breast tissues and TNBC tumors, and its expression is a strong independent marker for poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. Consistent with the role of stroma in breast tumorigenicity, CAFs from patients significantly promoted proliferation, matrix invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in our organotypic tumor model. Our analysis of RTK activities of TNBC cells showed high basal activation of EGFR, consistent with EGFR overexpression in up to 78% of TNBC tumors. But in the presence of CAFs, the HGF-MET axis was the dominant oncogenic signaling pathway. This finding highlights a potential reason for the failure of anti-EGFR monotherapies in TNBC, consistent with our results that showed EGFR inhibitors were not effective against TNBC cell invasiveness (Fig. S5a) or CAFs-mediated MET activation (Fig. S5b). However, crizotinib alone significantly reduced matrix invasion and EGFR activity of TNBC cells (Fig. S5a). These results emphasize limitations of targeting only genetic aberrations of cancer cells and the importance of tumor-stromal interactions as a therapeutic target in TNBC. Using a defined matrix in our model is a major advantage to capture effects of specific CAFs-TNBC signaling without additional stimulatory and inhibitory factors present in animal-derived matrices such as Matrigel. Selecting human collagen for our model was guided by previous finding that TNBC has a significant enrichment for collagen deposition compared with the luminal subtypes.Leveraging our 3D organotypic model that allows mechanistic studies to guide treatments, we investigated both single-agent and combination treatments against HGF-MET and its downstream pathways. As expected, single-agent inhibition of the MAPK pathway in a long-term, cyclic treatment regimen led to resistance of TNBC cells. Consistent with our finding, prior studies have shown feedback activation of oncogenic kinase pathways as a major resistance mechanism. To simultaneously suppress matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells, we designed combination treatments against both TNBC-CAFs interactions and basal active signaling in TNBC cells, i.e., crizotinib/trametinib for MDA-MB-231 cells and crizotinib/dactolisib for SUM159 cells. This strategy was critical because targeting only the TNBC-CAFs interaction or the TNBC cells proved insufficient. For example, using a MAPK inhibitor (trametinib) alone against MDA-MB-231 cells led to drug resistance (Fig. 6), whereas targeting only the CAFs-mediated MET activation using crizotinib alone reduced but did not block activities of signaling proteins in TNBC cells (Fig. 7). We note that crizotinib alone was very effective in downregulating oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells with a brief 10 min treatment, but this was reversed over a 5-day treatment, indicating that TNBC cells become resistant to monotherapy with crizotinib as well. The combination treatment successfully blocked activities of these pathways. In addition to the role of HGF-MET in primary tumor progression, this signaling promoted colony forming capability of TNBC cells in a lung stromal environment, consistent with the role of lung stromal cells in promoting metastatic colonization of cancer cells. Other studies showed that HGF significantly increased lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in mouse models. Interestingly, disrupting HGF-MET using crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of TNBC cells in our model of lung stroma, suggesting that this pathway has therapeutic value against TNBC metastases formation in the lungs.In conclusion, we developed an organotypic 3D tumor model and demonstrated that interactions between TNBC cells and patient-derived CAFs occur predominantly through HGF-MET axis. This tumor-stromal signaling activated several oncogenic pathways and promoted pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells and colony formation in the lung stroma. We developed a design-driven approach and showed the feasibility of targeting tumor-stromal interactions using specific drug combinations to significantly inhibit matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells in a primary tumor environment and their metastatic colonization in a lung stromal environment. Our engineered tumor model is conducive to phenotypic and mechanistic studies to identify new therapeutic opportunities against tumor-stromal interactions and develop and screen the effectiveness of various treatment combinations and regimens. We also note that CAFs also degrade and deposit ECM and change its mechanical properties. Investigating integrated effects of biochemical and mechanical inputs to facilitate cancer cell invasiveness can inform targeting of tumor-stromal interactions.Supplementary MaterialDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest: Authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesPrognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancerTargeted Therapies for Triple-Negative Breast CancerComprehensive Profiling of Poor-Risk Paired Primary and Recurrent Triple-Negative Breast Cancers Reveals Immune Phenotype ShiftsRisk of regional recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer patients: a Dutch cohort studyInfluence of tumour micro-environment heterogeneity on therapeutic responseThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerTumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretionA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsThe updated landscape of tumor microenvironment and drug repurposingModeling and predicting clinical efficacy for drugs targeting the tumor milieuThree-dimensional tumor model mimics stromal - breast cancer cells signalingA Human Organotypic Microfluidic Tumor Model Permits Investigation of the Interplay between Patient-Derived Fibroblasts and Breast Cancer CellsThree-dimensional models of breast cancer-fibroblasts interactionsA Living Biobank of Breast Cancer Organoids Captures Disease HeterogeneityOrganotypic breast tumor model elucidates dynamic remodeling of tumor microenvironmentMicrofluidic Endothelium for Studying the Intravascular Adhesion of Metastatic Breast Cancer CellsHigh Throughput, Polymeric Aqueous Two-Phase Printing of Tumor SpheroidsNanolitre liquid patterning in aqueous environments for spatially defined reagent delivery to mammalian cellsMicroprinted Stem Cell Niches Reveal Compounding Effect of Colony Size on Stromal Cells-Mediated Neural DifferentiationCyclical Treatment of Colorectal Tumor Spheroids Induces Resistance to MEK InhibitorsSynergistic Inhibition of Kinase Pathways Overcomes Resistance of Colorectal Cancer Spheroids to Cyclic Targeted TherapiesThe somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refine their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes (vol 7, 11479, 2016)TCPA: a resource for cancer functional proteomics dataPhytochemicals inhibit migration of triple negative breast cancer cells by targeting kinase signalingEpigenetic regulation of RTK signalingPhosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase or RAS pathway mutations in human breast cancer cell linesThe nanomechanical signature of breast cancerEMT, MET, Plasticity, and Tumor MetastasisRational Approaches for Combination Therapy Strategies Targeting the MAP Kinase Pathway in Solid TumorsThe Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark Gene Set CollectionHepatocyte growth factor produced in lung fibroblasts enhances non-small cell lung cancer cell survival and tumor progressionMetastasis-initiating cells induce and exploit a fibroblast niche to fuel malignant colonization of the lungsThe Proteomic Landscape of Triple-Negative Breast CancerIdentification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapiesBreast Cancer Cells Induce Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts to Secrete Hepatocyte Growth Factor to Enhance Breast TumorigenesisSingle-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in CancerCancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity in axillary lymph nodes drives metastases in breast cancer through complementary mechanismsCoexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and receptor (Met) in human breast carcinomaMet induces diverse mammary carcinomas in mice and is associated with human basal breast cancerExpression of scatter factor and c-met receptor in benign and malignant breast tissueExpression of c-met is a strong independent prognostic factor in breast carcinomaMet induces mammary tumors with diverse histologies and is associated with poor outcome and human basal breast cancerChemokines released by breast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in MCF7 breast cancer cellsMolecular characterization of EGFR and EGFR-downstream pathways in triple negative breast carcinomas with basal like featuresThe paradoxical functions of EGFR during breast cancer progressionHuman breast cancer invasion and aggression correlates with ECM stiffening and immune cell infiltrationMesenchymal Cancer Cell-Stroma Crosstalk Promotes Niche Activation, Epithelial Reversion, and Metastatic ColonizationTargeted expression of HGF/SF in mouse mammary epithelium leads to metastatic adenosquamous carcinomas through the activation of multiple signal transduction pathwaysApigenin inhibits HGF-promoted invasive growth and metastasis involving blocking PI3K/Akt pathway and beta 4 integrin function in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cellsCAFs interact with TNBC cells predominantly through the HGF-MET pathway.

        "content": "The purpose of this study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancer according to its cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. Immunohistochemistry staining of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), Ki-67, podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), S100A4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), PDGFR\u03b2, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2) was performed on tissue microarray consisting of 642 breast cancer cases. Samples were categorized into luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) according to immunohistochemical results, whereas tumor stroma was classified into desmoplastic, sclerotic, normal-like, or inflammatory type based on histological findings. Expression of CAF-related proteins in the stroma differed depending on breast cancer molecular subtypes. All CAF-related protein expression was high (p &lt; 0.05) in HER-2 type, whereas in luminal A, the expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2 was low, and in TNBC, the expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and S100A4 was low. In the stromal component, CAF-related protein expression differed according to stromal phenotype (p &lt; 0.001). The desmoplastic type showed high expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, S100A4, PDGFR\u03b1, and PDGFR\u03b2, whereas the sclerotic type exhibited low expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2. The inflammatory type had high expression of FAP\u03b1 and NG2 with low podoplanin, while normal-like type showed low expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and S100A4. Our results suggested that differential CAF-related protein expression depended on the molecular subtypes and stromal histologic features of breast cancer, indicating that in the future, this system could potentially use these markers for prognosis prediction and targeted therapy of breast cancer.",

        "content": "To study the effects of Prunella vulgaris polysaccharide (PVP) on human breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Cell viability was detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. Wound healing experiment and transwell migration assay were used to investigate the anti-migration effects. Flow cytometry was applied to detect cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in CAFs. Culture SKBr-3 with CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) to evaluate the indirect function on the proliferation of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells. PVP inhibited the viability of CAFs by inducing apoptosis (P &lt;0.01) and arresting cell cycle (P &lt;0.01). It also inhibited the migration of CAFs (P &lt;0.01). bFGF promoted CAFs proliferation (P &lt;0.01) and migration (P &lt;0.01), protected CAFs from apoptosis (P &lt;0.05) and reduced G<sub0</sub phase to 49.06% (P &lt;0.01). However, these effects of bFGF on CAFs could be abrogated by PVP. Culturing SKBr-3 with CAFs-CM, PVP could inhibit the viability of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells indirectly. Moreover, PVP reduced the mRNA expression (P &lt;0.01) and protein secretion of bFGF (P &lt;0.01) in CAFs. PVP could exert an anti-cancer effect on breast CAFs by inhibiting bFGF expression, thus inhibiting the growth of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells indirectly.",

        "title": "Targeting the tumor stroma as a novel treatment strategy for breast cancer: shifting from the neoplastic cell-centric to a stroma-centric paradigm.",
        "content": "The lack of targeted therapy for women with triple negative breast cancer demands a \"think-outside-the-box\" approach in search of novel treatment strategies. Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a special focus on FAP(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the \"generic\" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.",

        "title": "Isolation of normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts from fresh tissues by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most prominent cell type within the tumor stroma of many cancers, in particular breast carcinoma, and their prominent presence is often associated with poor prognosis. CAFs are an activated subpopulation of stromal fibroblasts, many of which express the myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. CAFs originate from local tissue fibroblasts as well as from bone marrow-derived cells recruited into the developing tumor and adopt a CAF phenotype under the influence of the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were shown to facilitate tumor initiation, growth and progression through signaling that promotes tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. We demonstrated that CAFs enhance tumor growth by mediating tumor-promoting inflammation, starting at the earliest pre-neoplastic stages. Despite increasing evidence of the key role CAFs play in facilitating tumor growth, studying CAFs has been an on-going challenge due to the lack of CAF-specific markers and the vast heterogeneity of these cells, with many subtypes co-existing in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, studying fibroblasts in vitro is hindered by the fact that their gene expression profile is often altered in tissue culture. To address this problem and to allow unbiased gene expression profiling of fibroblasts from fresh mouse and human tissues, we developed a method based on previous protocols for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Our approach relies on utilizing PDGFR\u03b1 as a surface marker to isolate fibroblasts from fresh mouse and human tissue. PDGFR\u03b1 is abundantly expressed by both normal fibroblasts and CAFs. This method allows isolation of pure populations of normal fibroblasts and CAFs, including, but not restricted to \u03b1-SMA+ activated myofibroblasts. Isolated fibroblasts can then be used for characterization and comparison of the evolution of gene expression that occurs in CAFs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, we and others reported expression profiling of fibroblasts isolated by cell sorting. This protocol was successfully performed to isolate and profile highly enriched populations of fibroblasts from skin, mammary, pancreas and lung tissues. Moreover, our method also allows culturing of sorted cells, in order to perform functional experiments and to avoid contamination by tumor cells, which is often a big obstacle when trying to culture CAFs.",

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

For stable cell line generation, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and pools of stable cells were selected with 10 ng/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs in the absence of insulin and hydrocortisone before TGF\u03b21 stimulation.Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitationCells were lysed in cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin hydrochloride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal protein was analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-p21 (F5), mouse anti-c-myc, mouse anti-p15, rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-cofilin and cofilin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and followed by secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or rabbit. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4\u00b0C using antibodies against p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (Abcam\u00ae, Cambridge, MA, USA) and p21. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was added for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and washed four times with cold lysis buffer. The immunocomplexes were boiled with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.Histone proteins extractionTotal histone proteins were extracted as previously described. Briefly, 80% confluent of SCP2 cells from a 100-mm tissue culture plate were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 or 1 \u00b5M trichostatin A (TSA). SCP2 cells were harvested and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 \u00b5M TSA and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u00b5l trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes.

Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equipment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s).

After two days, 25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity.

The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

        "title": "Experimental generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

        "content": "Carboxymethyl Benzylamide Dextran (CMDB7) displayed an in vitro growth inhibitory activity on breast tumor cells. CMDB7 is able to disrupt the interaction of angiogenic growth factors (FGF2, TGF beta and PDGF) with their membrane receptors. This compound blocks the angiogenesis of MDA-MB435 carcinoma xenografted in mammary fat pad and their lung metastases in nude mice. In this work, we studied the uptake of CMDB7 labeled with 99mTc in cultured human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line and the highly tumorigenic MCF-7ras cell line (Ha-ras-transfected MCF-7 cells) and the in vivo distribution in MCF-7ras tumor-bearing mice. The 99mTc-CMDB7 are stable and the intracellular concentration is time-dependent and reaches a plateau at 180 minutes. 99mTc CMDB7 uptake is much higher in MCF-7ras cells than MCF-7 cells. Since CMDB7 is internalized and could also inhibit cell proliferation by acting at nuclear sites, we investigated the MCF-7ras nuclear localization after cell fractionation. Cell fractionation revealed a cytoplasmic and nuclear internalization of CMDB7. The tumor uptakes of 99mTc-CMDB7 were 0.34%, 0.72% and 0.62% of the administrated doses per gram of tumor tissue at 1 hour, 3 hour and 5 hours respectively after their injection. The blood clearance of 99mTc CMDB7 was very rapid and the liver, spleen and kidney uptakes were very weak. These results confirm the absence of toxicity of CMDB7 and the usefulness of CMDB7 in cancer therapy by targeting breast tumors.",

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

The uncropped image for agarose gel can be found in Figure S5. (D) The densitometric analysis of PCR amplification products, accomplished by acquiring images and quantifying them through ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), was performed on three independent gels. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells sample was considered as 100% and standards 2, 3, 4 and 5 were graded relative to that (** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.001, Student\u2019s t-test).Fibrosarcoma cell invasion in the presence of fibroblasts pre-exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 in 3D-Organotypic assays. (A) Time scale representation of the 3D-organotypic invasion assay. 5 \u00d7 104 TIF fibroblasts/sample were first embedded into a neutralized collagen I solution and incubated for 3 days. Then 1 \u00d7 105 HT1080-GFP cells were seeded on the matrices, grown for 2 days (T0) and let to invade for 3 or 6 days. Matrices were then processed as described in Section 4.14. (B) Representative images of matrices sections after DAPI staining, 20\u00d7 magnification, Scale bar, 50 \u00b5m. Fibroblasts were processed as described in (A), in the absence of Pep 2 (NT). Duplicate samples were exposed to 100 nM Pep 2 during HT1080-GFP invasion (Pep 2 invasion) or to 100 nM Pep 1 or Pep 2 during matrix contraction (Pep 1 contraction, Pep 2 contraction) and then peptides were removed and the matrices washed twice with growth medium. During contraction or invasion peptides were added to matrices every day. (C) The number of invading cells was quantified by densitometric analysis of images shown in B, with ImageJ software, the number of HT1080-GFP invading cells on untreated matrices was normalized to T0 and the 3 days sample was considered as 100%.

        "content": "Tumors are supported by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are heterogeneous and carry out distinct cancer-associated functions. Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

Similar to site of injury, tumors through production of paracrine and endocrine signals enrolled MSCs in their microenvironment (TME) that is seen as a \"wound that never heals\". The ability of MSCs to migrate to tumors makes them potential cargo for anticancer agents. Once reached the tumors, MSCs may exert opposite roles depending on tumor types, thus supporting cancer progression, as reported in breast, melanoma, prostate and colon carcinomas or suppressing it, as in malignant glioma. The main source of MSCs in adult is bone marrow, even if additional tissues have been identified as font. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) along with fibroblasts, pericytes, adipocytes, macrophages and immune cells play a crucial role into microenvironment of breast cancers, promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and invasion, neo-angiogenesis, drug resistance and evasion of immunosurveillance. Once in TME, BM-MSCs can trans-differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or vascular and perivascular cells switching from neutral role toward pro-tumorigenic behavior. Recently, we reported the ability of BM-MSCs to promote migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells through chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). In the last decade, different biomolecules have been found involved in BM-MSCs recruitment and activity into breast cancer including chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5); transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin 17B; CXCL10 and placental growth factor. Recently, it has been reported that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling plays an important role in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. In addition, Dhawan et al. showed that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) along with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in bone marrow support in the dissemination of breast cancer cells.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), representing ~15% of all breast cancers, are characterized by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and ErbB2, excluding the possibility of specific intervention for these tumors. They are biologically more aggressive and have a very poor outcome compared to other breast tumors.In this study, we investigated the role of PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSC homing and activity into the highly malignant and invasive mesenchymal-like (ML) TNBC subtype. We have recently demonstrated that cells of this subtype have a strong tendency to vasculogenic mimicry (VM) both in vitro and in vivo, and that targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 interaction by an anti-EGFR aptamer, results in inhibition of VM and tumor growth in ML TNBC.To interfere with the PDGFR\u03b2-mediated cross-talk between BM-MSCs and tumor cells, we used a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer, named Gint4.T, that we have previously characterized as high specific inhibitor of the receptor in human glioblastoma. The aptamer binds at high affinity (Kd: 9.6 nmol/l) to the extracellular domain of the PDGFR\u03b2 and impedes the ligand-dependent activation of the receptor both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it has been validated in vivo for its tumor targeting efficacy, resulting neither toxic nor immunogenic.Here we show that Gint4.T aptamer inhibits the migration of BM-MSCs towards TNBC cells and their trans-differentiation into CAFs. In addition, we used in vivo cell-tracking method to monitor instantly, noninvasively and in real time the inhibitory effect of the aptamer on BM-MSC homing to breast cancer xenografts, which ultimately results in interfering with BM-MSC-dependent pro-invasive activity. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic agent that blocks either the recruitment of BM-MSCs into TME and the tumor cell-stroma interactions thus hampering TNBC aggressiveness.Materials and MethodsCell lines and culture conditionAll human breast cancer cell lines came from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. MCF-7 and U87MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were grown in RPMI 1640.For production of MDA-MB-231 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), lentiviral constructs and infection of cells were conducted as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on 12-well plates and infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 10% FBS and 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 48 hours of incubation, infection efficiency was determined by analyzing GFP expression by flow cytometry.To obtain conditioned medium (CM) cells were grown in medium with 1% FBS for 48 hours. The medium was then collected, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes, and filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm filters (Millipore,Billerica, MA) before being used.The concentration of PDGF-BB in CM of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells was measured using the ELISA method as reported.Human BM-MSC isolation and cultureHuman BM-MSCs were provided by Dr. Lucarelli. Samples were taken from patients after obtaining informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute. Isolation and culture condition of human BM-MSC was performed as previously described. BM-MSCs immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146 (staminal positive markers) and CD34 and CD45 (staminal negative markers). The BM-MSCs were used between passages 3-5.BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes has been evaluated as reported.BM-MSCs grown in the presence of MDA-MB-231 CM for 48 hours are referred as \"BM-MSCMDA-MB 231\".RNA isolation and Real time-PCRRNA isolation and Real time-PCR was performed as previously described. Briefly, total RNA from BM-MSCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green reaction mixture (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and an ABI Prism 7000 (robocycler was used for amplification Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene-specific primers used for the amplifications were as follows:PDGFR\u03b25'-AGGACACGCAGGAGGTCAT-3' (forward)5'-TTCTGCCAAAGCATGATGAC-3' (reverse)\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)5'-ACCCAGCACCATGAAGATCA-3' (forward)5'-AGAGACAGAGAGGAGCAGGA-3' (reverse)Fibroblast-specific Protein 1 (FSP-1)5'-CTCTCCTCAGCGCTTCTTCT-3' (forward)5'-GGGTCAGCAGCTCCTTTAGT-3' (reverse)Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)5'-TACGTTTCATCACTGGCCCT-3' (forward)5'-CATCTGCTGTTCCGTGGATG-3' (reverse)\u03b2-actin5'-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3' (forward)5'-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3' (reverse)Sox25'-AGAAGGATAAGTACACGCTGC -3' (forward)5'-TCCAGCCGTTCATGTGC -3' (reverse)Nanog5'-GAAATACCTCAGCCTCCAGC -3' (forward)5'-GCGTCACACCATTGCTATTC -3' (reverse)Aptamers and treatments2\u2032F-Py RNA aptamers (Gint4.T and Scrambled), developed by Camorani et al. , were synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies and purchased from Tebu-bio srl (Magenta, Milan, Italy). Before each treatment, the aptamers were subjected to a short denaturation-renaturation step as reported.Gint4.T aptamer, PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitor: 5'-UGUCGUGGGGCAUCGAGUAAAUGCAAUUCGACA-3'. Aptamer used as a negative control and herein indicated as Scr: 5'-UUCGUACCGGGUAGGUUGGCUUGCACAUAGAACGUGUCA-3'.Cell lysate preparation and western blot analysesWhole-cell lysates and Western blots analyses were performed as previously reported. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3173, indicated as pPDGFR\u03b2), rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3169), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (CST-9271, indicated as pAKT), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT (CST-9272), rabbit polyclonal anti anti-phospho44/42 MAPK (CST-9101, indicated as pERK) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (A4700, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk1 (sc-93) and goat polyclonal anti-vinculin (sc-7649) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of the targeted antibody was revealed by ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Densitometric analyses were performed on at least two different expositions to assure the linearity of each acquisition using ImageJ software (v1.46r). Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and cell invasion were performed using a 24-well Boyden chambers (Corning, NY) containing inserts of polycarbonate membranes with 8 \u03bcm pores. For migration assays, all cells tested (0.3 x 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were plated into each upper chamber in the presence of different chemoattractants (lower chamber). After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, the non-migrating cells were removed from the top chamber using a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane insert were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol and counted in 10 random fields/filter at 200x magnification. Results are expressed as the percentage of migrating cells considering the untreated control sample as 100%.To perform invasion assays, the top compartment of Boyden chambers was coated with 50 \u03bcl of diluted (1:3 in PBS) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After coating, chambers were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow Matrigel to solidify. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (0.5 \u00d7 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were then added to each top chamber. After incubation for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, invaded cells were visualized and analyzed as described above.Analysis of BM-MSC trans-differentiation into CAFBM-MSCs and TNBC cells were co-cultured in trans-well chambers with microporous-3\u00b5m membrane (Corning, NY). To this aim, BM-MSCs (1 x 106 cells) treated or no with Gint4.T and Scr were seeded into the lower chamber in a 6-multiwell. After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (50 x 105 cells) were added to each top chamber. After 5 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, total RNA was extracted from BM-MSCs and analyzed for CAF markers: \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1.NIR fluorescent BM-MSC-labelingVivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent (MW: 1173 gmol-1; A: 676 nm; Em: 696 nm) was commercially obtained from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA), dissolved in 1.3 mL of warm sterile PBS (final volume of 2.0 mL). BM-MSCs (1 x 106) were re-suspended in 200 \u00b5L of sterile PBS and incubated with VivoTrack 680 (ratio 1:1, v/v) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C under agitation in the dark. Afterwards, the suspension was washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS to remove excess cell labeling agent. At that time, VivoTrack 680-labeled cell viability was assessed microscopically by Tripan-blue exclusion (GibcoTM). To verify that the cells were successfully labelled, they were examined by flow cytometry (BD Accuri\u2122 C6), using appropriate lasers and filters for detection of 680 nm wavelength.Animal Tumor Models and treatmentAll experimental procedures complied with the European Communities Council directives (2010/63/EU) and national regulations (D.L. 116/92) and were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations. The present study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization number 38/2015-01-28). MDA-MB-231 cells (10 \u00d7 106) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of 1:1 mix of physiological saline and Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the flank of five-week-old Female Balb/c nude mice which weighed around 18-20 g (Charles River, Milan, Italy). Once tumors became palpable (established), approximately 50 mm3 [volume = 0.5 \u00d7 long diameter \u00d7 (short diameter)2], nude mice were randomized into 2 groups (3 mice for each group) for imaging studies.In order to develop a system that models the entire metastatic process, we injected MDA-MB-231/GFP cells (1\u00d7106) in presence or absence of BM-MSCs (1\u00d7106) in 150 \u00b5l of PBS Matrigel mixture (1:1, v:v) orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of severely immunocompromised NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. BM-MSCs were treated with Gint4.T (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours prior injection. Mice (3 mice for each group) were monitored for development of primary xenograft tumor with high-frequency ultrasound system (Vevo 2100 equipment; FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sixty days post injection, mice were euthanized and tumors and organs were removed. They were either stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for paraffin embedding/sectioning and H&E staining, or they were embedded in O.C.T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound and 10 \u00b5m frozen sections were incubated with DAPI for 5 minutes to stain nuclei blue and subsequently prepared for fluorescent microscopy of GFP.In vivo tracking of BM-MSC to TNBC xenografts by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT)For FMT studies, tumor-bearing mice were maintained on a diet with a purified, alfalfa-free rodent chow for 15 days before fluorescent imaging to minimize fluorescence in the gut. VivoTrack 680 alone or BM-MSCs (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) labeled with VivoTrack 680 and treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours were administered to MDA-MB-231 xenografts by caudal vein injection. Mice under isoflurane anesthesia were analyzed at different time points by FMT 4000 imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Epifluorescence (2D) and tomography (3D) datasets were both acquired and analyzed by FMT system software (TrueQuantTM v4.0) from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA). 3D regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around tumor regions, and a threshold was applied equal to 30% of the maximum value of fluorescence in the adjoining non-tumor area. The total amount (pmoles) of fluorochrome was automatically calculated relative to internal standards generated with known concentrations of the appropriate dye. After imaging studies, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and then harvested for FACS analysis of labeled BM-MSCs.Statistical analysisResults were obtained from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1SD. Statistical values were defined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows by t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.ResultsBM-MSCs promote TNBC cells migration and invasionTo investigate whether BM-MSCs have the ability to promote migration and invasion of ML MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells a trans-well assay was performed, in which each cancer cell line was exposed to BM-MSCs, added in the lower chamber (Figure 1A). We found that TNBC cells migrated much avidly when co-cultured with BM-MSCs for 24 hours (Figure 1B). Similarly, when TNBC cells were seeded on top compartment of trans-well coated with Matrigel a strong stimulation of their invasion was observed in the presence of BM-MSCs (Figure 1C). We also found increased expression of stem cell markers, such as Sox2 and Nanog in TNBC cells upon BM-MSCs co-culture for 5 days (Figure 1D).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits PDGFR\u03b2-mediated signaling pathway in BM-MSCsIn agreement with previous reports, we found that BM-MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 protein and mRNA (Figure 2A). Human PDGFR\u03b2-positive glioblastoma U87MG and PDGFR\u03b2-negative breast cancer MCF-7 cells were used as positive and negative control, respectively, in western blotting (left panel) and Real Time-PCR (right panel) analyses.Since several evidences show a critical role for PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSCs homing to tumor sites including malignant glioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and colon carcinomas we wondered whether the Gint4.T RNA aptamer, that we previously validated as a specific inhibitor of PDGFR\u03b2, is able to interfere with this phenomenon. The aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of human PDGFR\u03b2 thus interfering with PDGF-BB ligand stimulation of the receptor. Firstly, we verified the aptamer ability to inhibit ligand-dependent PDGFR\u03b2 activation and downstream phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways in BM-MSCs upon PDGF-BB stimulation (Figure 2B).It has been reported that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 and downstream ERK and AKT signaling inhibited human MSC osteogenesis in vitro . Accordingly, we found that the aptamer hampered BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes (Figure S1).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSCs migration towards TNBC cellsNext, we determined whether the aptamer-mediated inhibition of intracellular signaling initiated by PDGFR\u03b2 results in impairment of BM-MSCs migration. As shown in Figure 3A, treating BM-MSCs with the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduced cell migration stimulated by serum, causing 44% inhibition as compared with the Scr aptamer. A similar effect was elicited by imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on different tyrosine protein kinases including PDGFR\u03b2.MSCs have been recently described to home into breast carcinoma in response to numerous endocrine and paracrine signals. Importantly, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer caused a dramatic reduction of their migration toward PDGF-BB ligand as compared with controls treatment (Mock and Scr) (Figure 3B). Next, we analyzed the secretion of PDGF-BB in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 by ELISA. The data showed that PDGF-BB detected in BT-549 was 12,84 \u00b11.52 pg/ml whereas in MDA-MB-231 was 6.46 \u00b11,46 pg/ml. Accordingly, Gint4.T strongly inhibited BM-MSCs migration to both TNBC cell lines (Figure 3C).These results indicate that inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 with Gint4.T hampers the homing of BM-MSCs to TNBC cell lines.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC trans-differentiation into Cancer Associated FibroblastsBecause CAFs are well known to play a key role in tumor progression and metastatic spread we wondered whether BM-MSCs when co-cultured with TNBC cells acquire the expression of CAF-specific markers. Interestingly, a significant increase of mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1 was observed when BM-MSCs were exposed up to 5 days to MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, thus indicating that TNBC are able to induce BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into CAF-like cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, Gint4.T treatment strongly reduced CAF markers mRNA expression in BM-MSCs, co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B, left) and BT-549 (Figure 4B, right) compared to Scr negative control, thus suggesting the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSC differentiation into CAFs in TNBC microenvironment. Further, in order to assess the effect of the aptamer on the pro-invasive function of CAF-like BM-MSCs, BM-MSCs were grown for 48 hours in the presence of CM from MDA-MB-231 (BM-MSCMDA-MB 231) to induce a CAF-like phenotype (Figure 4C). Next, MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness was assessed by using CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 as chemoattractant in the transwell invasion assay. As shown (Figure 4D), CM from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 strongly increased the invasion rate of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and, importantly, Gint4.T interfered with this event.These results indicate that blocking PDGFR\u03b2 on BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer not only decreased their ability to migrate towards TNBC cells but also their capability to trans-differentiate in CAFs and to induce a pro-invasive phenotype of TNBC cells.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts as assessed by Fluorescence Molecular TomographyTo follow the homing of BM-MSCs toward TNBC in vivo, we labeled the cells with VivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent. As assessed by flow cytometry analysis, a total labeling efficiency was obtained at the experimental condition used (Figure 5A). First, we checked the absence of cell viability loss after labeling (data not shown). Then, nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts, were intravenously injected with VivoTrack 680-labeled BM-MSCs, treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer, and analyzed by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography at different time-points (Figure 5B). 3D images were reconstructed and volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated around the tumor. The fluorescence signal of BM-MSCs was visualized in the tumor at 2 hours post-injection and remained visualized up to 24 hours (Figure 5C). Because VivoTrack 680 emits at NIR wavelength where autofluorescence and tissue absorbance are minimal, a low fluorescence was observed in the tissues around the tumor. As shown, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer strongly reduced BM-MSC recruitment into MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared to the negative control (Figure 5C). Moreover, FACS analysis of NIR labeled BM-MSCs in cell suspension from tumors, revealed a significant decrease of BM-MSCs recruitment in tumors after their treatment with Gint4.T aptamer (Figure 5D), thus confirming the results of in vivo imaging. These findings prove the ability of the aptamer to inhibit tropism of BM-MSCs to TNBC targeting PDGFR\u03b2.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivoIn agreement with previous report we found that the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells is not affected when breast cancer cells were co-injected with BM-MSCs in mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice (Figure S2). Conversely, BM-MSCs increased the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in orthotopic model thus correlating with our in vitro findings. To investigate whether the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer has the ability to inhibit BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivo, GFP-labelled MDA-MB-231 were mixed with BM-MSCs, left untreated or prior treated with Gint4.T, and injected in mammary fat pad of mice. After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lungs were extracted for analysis. Although no visible macro-metastatic lesions were observed in each experimental mouse group, GFP fluorescence was evident in the lung sections demonstrating microscopic metastasis. As shown (Figure 5E), BM-MSCs induced a significant enhancement in the number of detectable multifocal metastatic lesions that was counteracted by Gint4.T treatment.DiscussionSince the tumor microenvironment contributes to many aspects of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, the different stromal cell types, which play key roles in determining or enhancing several hallmark capabilities in different TMEs, should be taken into account to stimulate future anticancer drug development. In particular, the recent discovery that MSCs can be recruited into TME and promote cancer progression has led to consider MSCs as a suitable target for anti-cancer therapy. Importantly, tumor associated-MSCs contribute to tumor cell growth and metastatic behavior in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, osteosarcoma and colon cancers. The high tropism of MSCs for malignant tumors is largely similar to what observed for inflamed and injured tissues and involve the same growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. Tumor cells are able to produce a chemotactic gradient consisting of different chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12 and CXCL16, which is able to recruit MSCs.Jung et al. (2013) showed that MSCs were both recruited as well as transformed in CAFs by CXCL16 produced by prostate cancer cells. In turn, MSC-like CAFs secreted CXCL12 that binding to CXCR4 on tumor cells induced an EMT, which ultimately promoted metastasis to secondary tumor sites.Many growth factors such as PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), TGF-\u03b2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been found to effectively mediate MSC homing to TME.Interestingly, several studies reported PDGF-BB as a critical mediator of MSC tropism to gliomas. It has been reported that recruitment of MSCs towards pancreatic tumors in response to PDGF, EGF and VEGF, can be inhibited by Glivec, Erbitux and Avastin, respectively. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that bFGF and downstream ERK/Smad3 signaling pathway are involved in BM-MSC tropism to 4T1 breast cancer cells by using a specific neutralizing antibody.An increasing number of evidence has shown that MSCs in primary tumors can differentiate in active components of the tumor microenvironment such as CAFs, which are known to play a key role in tumor progression, neo-angiogenesis, EMT and metastatic spread. Therefore, great interest has been shown in developing therapeutic targeting strategies aimed to inhibit MCS support thus improving therapeutic efficacy in treating cancer. Thus, in this scenario, the starting point for MSC targeted therapy is the identification of specific molecular pathways involved in pro-tumorigenic cross-talk between MSCs and cancer cells. The delineation of key molecular pathways that underlie this important interplay has improved the knowledge of the biology of TME, tumor spreading, and carcinogenesis. Over past years, several studies have shown that MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 suggesting that it could play a crucial role in processes in which MSCs are involved. In fact, it is widely reported that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in specifying MSC commitment to mesenchymal lineages as well as in MSC proliferation and self-renewal. Furthermore, PDGFR\u03b2 signaling has emerged as a predominant pathway in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. Hata et al. , for example, have demonstrated that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in MSC tropism for malignant gliomas, providing direct evidence that tumor is capable of attracting MSCs in an intracranial glioma model through PDGFR\u03b2 pathway. Furthermore, it has been reported that PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC recruitment into TME, contributed to enhance the aggressive and invasive properties of many other tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colon carcinomas. However, although PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitors have already been tested for their capability to target and interfere with receptor activity in MSCs, no studies have still demonstrated the possibility to target PDGFR\u03b2 to prevent pro-tumorigenic effect of MSCs into tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the current class of PDGFR\u03b2 drugs consists of small molecule TKIs that show limited specificity and modest efficacy whereas no antibodies have entered the clinic. This study reports, for the first time, an innovative therapeutic tool, an anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer able to prevent BM-MSC recruitment and activity into TNBC microenvironment. Recent evidences have widely shown that BM-MSCs can integrate into the tumor-associated stroma and promote the progression of TNBC through the activation of different mechanisms involving HIFs, TGF-\u03b2 and CCL5. Up to now, no work has demonstrated the involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 pathway in MSC homing toward TNBC microenvironment, as well as MSC-mediated TNBC progression. Interestingly, in this study we show that the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduces both in vitro BM-MSC migration stimulated by two different TNBC cell lines and in vivo BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts, as assessed by FMT. These results underline the importance of PDGFR\u03b2 in mediating MSC migration towards TNBC site and highlights Gint4.T aptamer to specifically prevent PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC tropism for TME. Finally, recent evidence has demonstrated that MSCs selectively proliferate in TME and trans-differentiate in pro-tumor supporting CAFs. Although the effect of MSCs on growth of breast cancer is controversial and probably depends on the experimental setting of the animal model, conversely, it is well established that MSCs have a significant impact on promoting breast cancer metastasis. Our data demonstrated that Gint4.T aptamer not only hampers PDGFR\u03b2 downstream signaling in BM-MSCs, but it also interferes with their recruitment into TNBC and with their differentiation into CAF thus preventing metastatic lung lesions (Figure 6).ConclusionsTumor microenvironment recruits MSCs from the circulation, adjacent tissues and bone-marrow thus educating these cells to adopt pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. MSCs in tumor cause a formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and can also enhance the proportions of cancer stem cells, promote EMT, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis. These effects contribute to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Our aptamer-based approach to interrupt the cross-talk between cancer cells, MSCs and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment will likely provide new anti-cancer opportunities.Abbreviations\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBM-MSCsbone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cellsCAFcarcinoma-associated fibroblastCCL5chemokine C-C motif ligand 5CLLchronic lymphocytic leukemiaCXCL10C-X-C motif chemokine 10CXCR4chemokine receptor type 4DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionERK 1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2FAPfibroblast activation proteinFBSfetal bovine serumFMTFluorescence Molecular TomographyFSP-1Fibroblast-specific Protein 1MLmesenchymal-likeMSCsmesenchymal stem cellsPDGF-BBplatelet-derived growth factor BBPDGFR\u03b2platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2PI3Kphosphatidyl-3-kinaseROIsregions of interestTAMstumor-associated macrophagesTMEtumor microenvironmentTNBCtriple-negative breast cancerTGF-\u03b2transforming growth factor \u03b2VOIsvolumes of interestSupplementary MaterialInteraction of MSC with tumor cellsMesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancer metastasisBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the tumor microenvironmentMesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.

        "content": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine with the capability to act as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the cellular context. TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) is the ligand-binding receptor for all members of the TGF-\u03b2 family. Data from mouse model experiments demonstrated that loss of Tgfbr2 expression in mammary fibroblasts was linked to tumour initiation and metastasis. Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values. The study revealed that CAF-specific TGFBR2 expression correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed CAF-TGFBR2 to be an independent prognostic marker (multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratio: 0.534, 95% (CI): 0.360-0.793, P=0.002). CAF-specific pSMAD2 levels, however, did not associate with survival outcome. Experimentally, TGF-\u03b2 signalling in fibroblasts was modulated using a TGF-\u03b2 ligand and inhibitor or through lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated TGFBR2-specific knockdown. To determine the role of fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway on breast cancer cells, we used cell contact-dependent cell growth and clonogenicity assays, which showed that knockdown of TGFBR2 in CAFs resulted in increased cell growth, proliferation and clonogenic survival. Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored. We found that mouse xenograft tumours comprising TGFBR2 knockdown fibroblasts were slightly bigger and displayed increased tumour cell capacity. Overall, our data demonstrate that fibroblast-related biomarkers possess clinically relevant information and that fibroblasts confer effects on breast cancer cell growth and survival. Regulation of tumour-stromal cross-talk through fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway may depend on fibroblast phenotype, emphasising the importance to characterise tumour microenvironment subtypes. ",

Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.IntroductionCarcinomas are composed of neoplastic cells admixed with many types of supportive cells, which constitute the tumour stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant cell type within cancer stroma, play significant roles in overall breast cancer development and spread. Genetic and epigenetic changes activate stromal fibroblasts, which then escort cancer cells throughout the whole carcinogenic process in a paracrine manner. Indeed, activated fibroblasts secrete high levels of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which are used to communicate with cancer cells as well as with other stromal cells. CAFs exhibit some important features of neoplastic cells and have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models. High numbers of active stromal fibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs were shown to play major roles in drug resistance and tumour recurrence.Surgery is considered the first line of treatment for most breast tumours. During lumpectomy, the tumour is removed with some normal surrounding tissues (surgical margins) to ensure the removal of all tumour cells and to minimize local recurrence. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that surgical margin status influences the risk of local recurrence. Recurrences arise most frequently in the tumour bed. Thereby, radiotherapy is usually applied as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Furthermore, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) was also used and yielded very low recurrence rates when given as a boost. Importantly, TARGIT impaired the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding. This may be due to the immediate effect of radiation on the local tumour microenvironment, making it less favourable for tumour growth and progression. This suggests that cancer may recur following breast conserving surgery due to residual unresected tumour or to the presence of active stromal cells, or both. In fact, even in tumour-free tissues, the microenvironment could still play a capital role in tumour development/recurrence. Indeed, it has been recently shown that breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography, which is related to the surrounding stroma rather than to the cancer itself, had poorer prognostic features. Therefore, we sought to undergo molecular and cellular characterization of breast stromal fibroblasts from negative surgical margins. We show that these cells exhibit a specific gene expression profile and are procarcinogenic.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblasts were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients under Research Ethical Committee Project No. RAC#2031091. CAFs were derived from tumour areas of the samples, while TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of tissues was performed after routine examination by a certified anatomical pathologist, using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and epithelial cells (NLECs) were derived from healthy age-matched females who underwent breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments, NBFs, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, under the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). NLEC cells were cultured in universal medium [1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10\u20138 m choleratoxin, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 2 \u00d7 10\u20139 m T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 5 mg/ml oestrogen, and were used at passage 2. MCF-7 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), except for antibiotic/antimycotics and ITS, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells cultured in medium with serum, whilst serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was obtained from cells cultured in the absence of serum. In both cases, the cells were cultured for 24 h before the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Affymetrix exon array and data analysis; quantitative RT\u2013PCRExon array protocols are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was conducted as described previously. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the data analysed using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The respective primers are presented in Supplementary materials and methods.Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48 h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) after incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified at 450 nm.Immunoblotting, cytokine array and ELISAImmunoblotting of total cell protein lysates was performed as previously described. Antibodies are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. SFCMs from CAF, TCF and NBF cells were applied to a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody array (RayBiotech Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems; or RayBiotech for MMP-2). These experiments were performed in triplicate.Chemotaxis and invasion assayInvasion chambers (24-well) were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines (BD Bioscience); 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells, separated by an 8 \u00b5m pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane, using Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using a light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification \u00d740). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Orthotopic tumour xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH & RC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Fifteen female nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper, using the formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSurgical margin stromal fibroblasts exhibit a specific gene expression profileTo identify the molecular changes that can take place in breast stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins, gene expression profiles of five paired CAFs/TCFs as well as three NBFs were examined. Total RNA was extracted and genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed, using Affymetrix's GeneChip\u00ae Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (HE 1.0 STAs). Three different comparisons were performed: TCFs with CAFs; TCFs with NBFs; and CAFs with NBFs. p < 0.05 and a threshold of absolute fold change \u2264 2 \u2265 was considered a significant difference in the analysis of the microarray data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 804 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCF, CAF and NBF cells. The unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering revealed a clear pattern of gene expression, defining three main transcriptome clusters corresponding to TCFs, CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A).Differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Total RNA from five CAFs, their corresponding TCFs as well as three NBFs was used to perform genome-wide gene expression analysis. (A) Unsupervised 2D hierarchical clustering of significantly varying genes across the three groups was performed using Pearson's correlation with average linkage clustering (only the top 112 of the most significantly dysregulated genes are shown for readability). (B) The three dominant PCA components that contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix clearly distinguished samples as CAF, TCF and NBF. (C) Venn diagram showing differential gene expression between the groups. (D) qRT\u2013PCR data for the indicated genes (mean \u00b1 SD)Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA), which contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix, further showed the presence of three distinct groups (Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the TCF samples clustered closer to CAF cells than to NBFs. Moreover, the gene expression variability was highest for the TCF group (Figure 1B). Next, Venn diagram analysis was performed, with the significance of overlaps calculated using hypergeometric distributional assumption and p values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This comparison approach revealed a significant overlap between TCFs and CAFs as compared to the two other comparisons (p < 10\u20135) (Figure 1C). Indeed, among the three comparisons, the least number of DEGs was between CAFs versus TCFs, with only 42 DEGs (Figure 1C). On the other hand, the number of DEGs between CAFs and NBFs reached 101 (Figure 1C). Comparing TCF with NBF, we found 77 DEGs, 25 of which were also differentially expressed between CAFs and NBFs, while the levels of 49 genes were uniquely dysregulated in TCFs as compared to NBFs and CAFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that TCF cells present in surgical margins exhibit specific gene expression patterns relative to their corresponding CAFs and also normal breast fibroblasts.Quantitative RT\u2013PCR validation of gene expression resultsTo validate the RNA microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT\u2013PCR on nine genes: MMP-3, ITGB8, SFRP4, ITGBP7, ADAMTS1, CTGF, PTGS, SDHC and CCL-2. Figure 1D shows differential expression of all these genes between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. These results confirm the presence of differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokinesNext, we assessed the level of secreted pro-carcinogenic cytokines from CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Therefore, CAF-114, TCF-114 and NBF-6 were cultured to 80% confluency and then complete medium (CpM) was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM). Serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied to the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody array map. The array showed differential levels of various cytokines between TCF, CAF and NBF cells (Figure 2A). Upon quantification and normalization against the positive controls probed on the membrane, it was clear that CAFs secreted the highest levels of the majority of these cytokines (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the levels of SDF-1, CCL-25, TIMP-1 and TNF-alfa were also higher in TCF-114 cells than in NBF cells (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when comparing CAF-180, TCF-180 and NBF-1 (data not shown). This shows that TCFs, although present in histologically normal parts of the breast, secrete high levels of various pro-carcinogenic cytokines.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokines. SFCMs from the indicated cells were collected and applied on the human cytokine antibody array map. (A) Cytokine array maps highlighting the differentially expressed cytokines. (B) Quantification of the array data for selected cytokines. (C) SFCMs were used to assess the levels of the indicated proteins by ELISA in CAF/TCF pairs from three patients compared to NBF-6 (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005)TCFs secrete high levels of SDF-1, VEGF-A and IL-6To further show the variation in cytokine secretion, SFCMs were collected from three different CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (87, 180 and 142) and NBF-6, and were used to assess the levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A by ELISA. Figure 2C shows that CAF cells secreted the highest levels of the three cytokines. Interestingly, the secreted levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A were also higher in all TCFs compared to NBF-6 (8.2-, 4.2- and 25-fold higher, respectively) (Figure 2C). Figure 2C also shows inter-patient variation in the secreted levels of these important pro-carcinogenic factors. These results confirm that TCF cells secrete higher levels of pro-carcinogenic factors relative to normal breast fibroblasts.TCF cells from surgical margins exhibit features of active fibroblastsTo test whether fibroblasts from surgical margins display features of activation, we examined the levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 (two major markers of active breast fibroblasts) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, like CAF cells, TCFs also express higher levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 than NBF-6 and NBF-1 (Figure 3A). However, while the level of \u03b1-SMA was similar in TCFs and their corresponding CAFs, SDF-1 levels were slightly higher in CAF cells as compared to their respective TCFs (Figure 3A). Next, we studied the migratory and invasiveness abilities of TCF cells, using chambers either coated with Matrigel (invasion) or uncoated (migration). While CpM was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells (4 \u00d7 105) were added to the upper wells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Figure 3B shows that while NBF-1 and NBF-6 cells were unable to migrate, TCF-87 and TCF-180 cells showed invasiveness and migratory abilities. However, the number of invading and migrating TCF cells was lower than that of their corresponding CAF cells (Figure 3B). This provides further evidence that TCF cells display active fibroblast features.TCFs are active fibroblasts. (A) Immunoblotting for \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 of the indicated cell lysates. (B) Invasion/migration assays. The numbers of invaded/migrated cells are presented in the histogram (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005 for TCFs compared to NBF-1 and NBF-6; note that CAFs are also significantly different)Surgical margin fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous epithelial cellsTo further show the active state of TCF cells, we studied their paracrine effect on the proliferation of epithelial cells. SFCMs collected from CAF/TCF-142, -180, -87 and \u2212114 pairs and from NBF-6 and NBF-1 were used for culturing non-cancerous MCF10A epithelial cells. Proliferation of MCF10A cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF and TCF cells, compared to NBF cells. TCFs showed an intermediate effect between CAFs and NBFs (Figure 4). Indeed, after 24 h of incubation, SFCMs from TCF-87 and CAF-87 enhanced cell proliferation two- and four-fold, respectively, compared to SFCM from NBF cells (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained with CAF/TCF-180 and \u2212142 pairs (Figure 4). For CAF/TCF-114, both enhanced the proliferation of MCF10A by four-fold at 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs also enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.TCF-conditioned medium enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MCF10A cells were cultured in SFCMs from the indicated fibroblasts from four patients and proliferation measured at the indicated times using the WST-1 assay, compared to SFCMs from the two NBF cultures performed at the same time. Error bars represent \u00b1 SDTCFs promote migration/invasion and induce mesenchymal features of breast cancer cellsWe next investigated the effect of TCF cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. SFCMs collected from TCF-180, CAF-180 and NBF-6 were added to MCF-7 cells (105) that had previously been seeded in the upper compartments of migration/invasion plates. Figure 5A shows that the number of migrated MCF-7 cells was much higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF-180 and TCF-180 than with NBF-6 cells or SFM (used as negative control). Figure 5A shows that SFCMs from both CAF-180 and TCF-180 enhanced about 73-fold the migration ability of these breast cancer cells as compared to NBF-6.TCF cells enhance the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and promote EMT. (A) SCFMs from the indicated cells were added into the lower compartments of 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MCF-7 cells (105) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24 h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells are presented (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005). (B, C) MCF-7 or normal luminal epithelial cells (NLEC) were treated with the indicated SFCMs for 24 h and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodiesNext, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism/pathway that underlies TCF-dependent increase in the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored the paracrine effect of TCF cells on the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, a known pro-invasive protein kinase. Epithelial MCF-7 cells were treated with SFM or SFCM from TCF-180 and CAF-180 for 24 h. Figure 5B shows that SFCMs from TCF and CAF cells increased the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt, with no effect on the level of total protein. Since active Akt and the increase in the invasiveness/migratory abilities of breast cancer cells accompany the transition of these epithelial cells to the mesenchymal phenotype, we assessed the level of N-cadherin and Snail and showed that SFCM from TCF cells increased the level of these two important markers of mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B). On the other hand, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were markedly reduced (Figure 5B). These results indicate that, like CAFs, TCF cells have the ability to trigger the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.TCF cells activate Akt and up-regulate PCNA and MMP-2 in normal luminal cells in a paracrine mannerSince TCFs are present in histologically normal parts of the breast, we sought to investigate their effect on primary normal luminal epithelial cells (NLECs). Therefore, NLECs were incubated for 24 h with SFCMs from TCF, CAF and NBF, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Figure 5C shows increase in the level of the proliferation marker PCNA in luminal cells pretreated with SFCMs from CAF and TCF cells, with a higher effect of CAF cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt and also MMP-2 increased under the paracrine effect of TCF and CAF cells (Figure 5C). This shows that, like CAF cells, TCFs have the ability to promote tumourigenesis in normal luminal epithelial cells.TCFs stimulate breast cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse modelTo investigate the effect of fibroblasts on tumour growth in vivo, 15 nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer tumours were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. All mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF-180 cells developed tumours. On the other hand, while two of five mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and TCF-180 cells had tumours, only one mouse co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and NBF-6 cells developed a tumour (Figure 6A). Importantly, this tumour appeared 29 days post-injection, while tumours containing TCF and CAF cells appeared only 15 days after implantation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, at 40 days post-injection, while the size of the tumour containing NBF-6 cells reached a volume of 1.4 cm3, the tumours containing TCF and CAF cells reached 4 cm3 and 7 cm3 on average, respectively (Figure 6A, B). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs have the ability to promote tumour formation and growth compared to normal fibroblasts.TCFs enhance the formation and the growth of human breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice. Breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells under the nipples of nude mice. (A) Tumour size 40 days post-injection. (B) Time-dependent tumour growth (mean \u00b1 SD)DiscussionWe have shown here that breast stromal fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins exhibit a specific gene expression pattern compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal breast fibroblasts, with 77 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and NBFs and 42 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and their paired CAFs. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of 49 genes was specific for TCF cells, as compared to CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues around tumours may also be affected by the presence of tumour cells. Notably, the genes that were found differentially expressed uniquely in TCFs were enriched with biological processes and functions related to, among others, inflammatory response, response to stimulus, immune cell trafficking, tissue development and cell signalling (see Supplementary material, Figure S1A, Table S2). To elucidate how these deregulated genes are interacting with genes in various metabolic pathways, the DEGs were mapped to gene networks using the ingenuity knowledge base. The network analysis revealed the potentially important role of CCL13, CTGF, CYP1B1, IGFBP7 and B4GALT1 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1B). Interestingly, genes deregulated in TCF cells interact, directly or indirectly, with the UBC gene (see Supplementary material, Figure S1C), which plays an essential role in maintaining ubiquitin levels, especially under stress conditions. Indeed, this polyubiquitin gene is up-regulated by cellular stresses and contains classical heat-shock elements in its promoter, suggesting that stress-related factors are involved in the TCF-specific gene expression profile and may relate to evidence that cancer cells use oxidative stress to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Comparing the variation in gene expression in each cell type showed variability within the three categories of cells. Interestingly, the gene expression profiles of TCF cells were more heterogeneous than those of CAF and NBF cells (Figure 1C), indicating higher patient-to-patient variability in stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues.Differential gene expression between CAF and TCF cells from breast tumours has been reported previously. Bauer et al found 37 genes differentially expressed between six paired TCFs and CAFs and have also shown higher gene expression variability in TCF than in CAF cells. In another study, 420 genes were found to be differentially expressed between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties (NBFs). Similarly, we have shown here that the expression of 101 genes varied between CAF and NBF cells. However, the current study presents the first micro-array comparative analysis between surgical margin fibroblasts, their corresponding CAFs and NBFs. In addition, we have shown that fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins have higher migratory/invasiveness abilities than normal breast fibroblasts. Furthermore, these cells enhanced the proliferation rate of non-carcinogenic epithelial cells and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as the formation/growth of breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, like CAFs, TCFs induced features of mesenchymal cells in breast cancer cells. Moreover, TCFs up-regulated PCNA and MMP2 and activated Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. This indicates that these cells have the ability to promote cancer development and progression. This effect could be mediated through secretion of cytokines and/or energy transfer mechanisms (reverse Warburg effect).Notably, the magnitude of all these TCF-related effects was intermediate between those of CAFs and NBFs. This shows that, despite their localization in histologically normal breast tissues and not being in direct contact with cancer cells, TCFs acquired some myofibroblast features, suggesting that cancer cells can affect not only cancer-associated fibroblasts but also fibroblasts present in cancer-free adjacent tissues. This effect could be mediated through secreted molecules able to diffuse from cancer cells through normal tissue, reaching distant cells. TGF\u03b2 could play an important role in this effect. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 can induce the production of \u03b1-SMA in mammary fibroblasts in vitro and consequently transdifferentiates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It is also possible that cancer cells activate adjacent fibroblasts through the aerobic glycolysis process (Warburg effect), which produces pyruvate and lactate. Indeed, treatment with lactate transport inhibitor prevented the conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.Our data indicate that remaining active fibroblasts following resection may enhance the chances of tumour recurrence, since these cells may constitute a fertile soil for tumour growth. To date, the most appropriate amount of normal breast tissue that should be removed to minimize local recurrence remains controversial. However, it is well known that local recurrence in patients submitted to conservative surgery is more common than in patients treated by mastectomy, showing the importance of surgical margins status for local relapse. Furthermore, several publications have reported the importance of the pathological margin status in determining the risk of local recurrence after breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, the present data show that breast stromal fibroblasts localized in cancer-free surgical margins are active and hence can potentiate the carcinogenesis process, and indicate that the tumour microenvironment may play determinant roles in local recurrence. Therefore, in the era of personalized therapy, the status of tumour stroma should also be taken into consideration for more efficient treatment and the prevention of recurrence as well as metastasis.Author contributionsMAA, S-FH and AAl performed experiments and analysed the data; FA performed experiments on the mice; DC and NK performed the micro-array data analysis; OA provided the tissues; AA supervised the work and analysed the data; and DC and AA wrote the paper.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in cancer progression by contributing to invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Solid tumors possess a unique microenvironment characterized by local hypoxia, which induces gene expression changes and biological features leading to poor outcomes. Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) is the main transcription factor that mediates the cell response to hypoxia through different mechanisms that include the regulation of genes strongly associated with cancer aggressiveness. Among the HIF-1 target genes, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) exerts a stimulatory role in diverse types of cancer cells and in CAFs. We evaluated the regulation and function of the key angiogenic mediator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CAFs exposed to hypoxia. Gene expression studies, Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence experiments were performed in CAFs and breast cancer cells in the presence of cobalt chloride (CoCl\u2082) or cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O\u2082), in order to analyze the involvement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the biological responses to hypoxia. We also explored the role of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway in functional assays like tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cell migration in CAFs. We first determined that hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs, then we ascertained that the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling is involved in the regulation of VEGF expression in breast cancer cells and in CAFs exposed to hypoxia. We also assessed by ChIP assay that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence and required for VEGF promoter stimulation upon hypoxic condition. As a biological counterpart of these findings, conditioned medium from hypoxic CAFs promoted tube formation in HUVECs in a HIF-1\u03b1/GPER dependent manner. The functional cooperation between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs was also evidenced in the hypoxia-induced cell migration, which involved a further target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling like connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). The present results provide novel insight into the role elicited by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway in CAFs towards the hypoxia-dependent tumor angiogenesis. Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.",

Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) is the main transcription factor that mediates the cell response to hypoxia through different mechanisms that include the regulation of genes strongly associated with cancer aggressiveness. Among the HIF-1 target genes, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) exerts a stimulatory role in diverse types of cancer cells and in CAFs.MethodsWe evaluated the regulation and function of the key angiogenic mediator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CAFs exposed to hypoxia. Gene expression studies, Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence experiments were performed in CAFs and breast cancer cells in the presence of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) or cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2), in order to analyze the involvement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the biological responses to hypoxia. We also explored the role of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway in functional assays like tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cell migration in CAFs.ResultsWe first determined that hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs, then we ascertained that the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling is involved in the regulation of VEGF expression in breast cancer cells and in CAFs exposed to hypoxia. We also assessed by ChIP assay that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence and required for VEGF promoter stimulation upon hypoxic condition. As a biological counterpart of these findings, conditioned medium from hypoxic CAFs promoted tube formation in HUVECs in a HIF-1\u03b1/GPER dependent manner. The functional cooperation between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs was also evidenced in the hypoxia-induced cell migration, which involved a further target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling like connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).ConclusionsThe present results provide novel insight into the role elicited by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway in CAFs towards the hypoxia-dependent tumor angiogenesis. Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.IntroductionThe cooperative interactions among tumor cells and reactive stroma strongly contribute to cancer development and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been indicated as the main cellular component of the tumor microenvironment involved in cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. In breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics through multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of new blood vessels, mainly generated by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Indeed, mechanisms of cell sensing and adaptation to stressful environments are activated within the hypoxic tumor mass, leading to the growth and aggressiveness of malignant cells. The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) primarily mediates the cell responses to a low oxygen tension playing a crucial role in cancer development. In particular, HIF-1 activates a signaling transduction network which drives the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of the hypoxia-inducible \u03b1 subunit and the constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 dimerize upon exposure to hypoxia, generating a complex which binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of target genes. In this regard, it has been shown that HIF-1 is a leading regulator of tumor angiogenesis following hypoxia, as it regulates the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors, like the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Recently, we discovered a further HIF-1-regulated gene, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), which contributes to the adaptation to a low oxygen environment in breast cancer cells and in cardiomyocytes. In particular, we found that the cooperation between GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 upon exposure to hypoxia leads to the up-regulation of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which is a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER. Surprisingly, we also assessed that in CAFs derived from breast cancer malignancies GPER acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. On the basis of these data, GPER-mediated functions may be included among the mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment.Considering that hypoxia regulates HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of both GPER and VEGF in different model systems, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential involvement of GPER in the expression and function of VEGF in CAFs and breast cancer cells. In this regard, we demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates the up-regulation of VEGF as well as the endothelial tube formation, suggesting that this transduction pathway may be involved in the intricate stimulatory responses to hypoxia within the cancer stroma. Our data may open new perspectives towards innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the breast cancer microenvironment.Materials and methodsReagentsCobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Srl (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) was obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). Human CTGF was purchased from MBL International Corporation, distributed by Eppendorf, (Milan, Italy). Human VEGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC, CTGF and VEGF, which were solubilized in water.Ethics statementAll procedures conformed to the Helsinki Declaration for the research on humans. The experimental research has been performed with the ethical approval provided by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital in Cosenza, Italy.Cell culturesThe SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The murine cardiomyocyte-like cell line HL-1 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA). In particular, the HL-1 cell line was established from a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor excised from an adult female Jackson Laboratory-inbred C57BLy6J mouse (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). HL-1 cells were cultured according to the published protocol in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Bioscience, Sigma-Aldrich Srl), 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 0.1 mM norepinephrine (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). All cell lines were grown in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were treated with CoCl2 or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) in a HeraCell incubator (ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy). Cells were switched to medium without serum the day before experiments.Isolation, cultivation and characterization of CAFsCAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies as previously described. Signed informed consent from all the patients and IRB approval were obtained. In particular, tissues obtained were cut into smaller pieces (1 to 2 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for two minutes. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485 \u00d7 g for eight minutes, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham's F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) and cultured at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. In each patient, a second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. We used CAFs and fibroblasts passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. Primary cells cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001), all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy). In order to assess fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All experiments were performed in each CAF population obtained from six patients. Data presented were obtained in CAFs derived from one patient; however, results similar to those shown were found in CAFs derived from the other five patients.Gene reporter assaysThe 2.6 kb VEGF promoter-luciferase construct containing full-length VEGF promoter sequence (22,361 to +298 bp relative to the transcription start site) used in luciferase assays was a kind gift from Dr. Pal Soumitro (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). CAFs or SkBr3 cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u03bcL/well culture medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 h with control shRNA, shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER. Next, a mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was transfected within cells. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). After 8 h, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed to low oxygen (2% O2) for 12 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) normalized to the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as one-fold induction, from which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.Gene expression studiesTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not degraded and showed clear 18S and 28S bands under ultraviolet light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected genes was quantified by both real-time RT-PCR using Step One\u00ae sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Milan, Italy) and semiquantitative RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and are as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'-TGCATCTCCATCTTCTACCCAAGT-3' and Rev: 5'-CCGACTGTGAGTGCCACTGT-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'-ACACACCTGGGTGGACACAA-3' and Rev: 5'-GGAGCCAGAAGCCACATCTG-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ACCTGTGGGATGGGCATCT-3' and Rev: 5'-CAGGCGGCTCTGCTTCTCTA-3'; VEGF (human): Fwd: 5'- TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-3' and Rev: 5'- TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'- GGAGATCCTTCGAGGAGCACTT-3' and Rev: 5'- GGCGATTTA GCAGCAGATATAAGAA-3'; 18S (human, mouse) Fwd: 5'-GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-3' and Rev: 5'- GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT -3. The ribosomal protein 18S was used as a control gene to obtain normalized values.For semiquantitative PCR, primers were as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'- GCTGATTTGTGAACCCAT TC-3' and Rev: 5'- CTGTACTGTCCTGTGGTGAC-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'- CTGGGGAGTTTCCTG TCTGA -3' and Rev: 5'-GCTTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ATGGCATGAAGCCAGAGAGT-3' and Rev: 3'-GGTCAGTGAGCACGCTAAAA-3'; VEGF (human) Fwd: 5'-GAGCTTCAGGACATTGCTGT-3' and Rev: 5'-AGGAAGGTCAACCACTCACA-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3' and Rev: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3'; 36B4 (human) Fwd: 5'-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3' and Rev: 5'-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3'; GAPDH (mouse) Fwd: 5'-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3' and Rev: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'. 36B4 and GAPDH were used as control genes to obtain normalized values.Western blot analysisTo prepare lysates, CAFs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 50 mM Hepes solution, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to the Bradford method. Cell lysates (10 to 50 \u03bcg of protein) were electrophoresed through a reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary polyclonal IgG antibody for HIF-1\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Celbio, Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), CTGF (L-20), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), \u03b2-actin (C2), b-tubulin (H-235-2) and appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA). The levels of proteins and phosphoproteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and revealed using the ECL\u00ae System (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).Gene silencing experimentsCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected for 24 h before treatments with a control vector or an independent shRNA sequence for each target gene using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics). The shRNA plasmid for HIF-1\u03b1 and the respective control plasmids were purchased from SABioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA). The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by the construct which we have previously described and used.Immunofluorescence microscopyFifty percent confluent cultured CAFs, SkBr3 and HL-1 cells grown on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed for 12 h to low oxygen tension (2% O2). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments, cells were previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids (as described above) and then treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, or cultured under hypoxia as indicated. Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging System supported by quantification and image processing software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (Leica Microsystems CMS, GbH Mannheim, Germany) were used for experiment evaluation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCAFs were grown in 10-cm dishes to 60 to 70% confluence, serum deprived for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, USA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primer for the -1,216 to -883 region of the human VEGF promoter containing the HRE site is 5'-CACAGACCTTCACAGCCATC-3' (forward hHRE) and 5'-CCCAGCGTAGACAGTTGAGT-3' (reverse hHRE). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation. For knockdown experiments CAFs were previously transfected in serum-free medium for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and the respective control shRNA (as described above) and then treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2.Migration assayMigration assays were performed with CAFs in triplicate using Boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8 mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich Srl). CAFs were transfected with shRNA constructs directed against HIF-1\u03b1, GPER or with an unrelated control shRNA construct in regular growth medium. After 24 h, cells were exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 6 h in medium without serum. Then, cells were maintained for 24 h in normoxic conditions (20% O2) in medium without serum. This experimental condition has been designed in order to reproduce the unbalanced oxygenation occurring within solid tumors, where the irregular blood flow is responsible for hypoxia and reoxygenation phases. CAFs were, therefore, trypsinized and seeded in the upper chambers. CTGF (100 ng/mL) was added to the medium without serum in the bottom wells where applicable. Six hours after seeding, cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed and counted.Conditioned mediumCAFs were cultured in regular growth medium to 80% confluence. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with shHIF-1\u03b1, shGPER or control shRNA using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions for 12 h. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in HUVECs.Protein precipitation with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)Conditioned medium from CAFs (see above) was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and 10 \u03bcg/mL BSA (final concentration) was added as a control for precipitation efficiency. TCA (100% solution) was added to a final concentration of 20% to conditioned media. After a 20-minute incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 31,000 g for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C). Pellets were washed with cold acetone, centrifuged at 31,000 g for 30 minutes (4\u00b0C), air dried and resuspended in protein lysis buffer (described above). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford Method and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using 100 \u03bcg protein/lane.Tube formation assayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37\u00b0C in serum free medium (EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen, Inc., Helgerman Court, Gaithersburg, USA) was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates and left at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Invitrogen), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel\u00ae and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls' testing to determine differences in means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsHypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression in CAFsIn order to provide further insight into the response to hypoxia in main components of the tumor microenvironment like CAFs, we began our study showing that hypoxia induces the mRNA expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene GPER, as ascertained by real time PCR (Figure 1) and semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). In particular, CAFs were treated from 1 h to 24 h with the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2 (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 1a) or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1b). The induction of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mRNA expression was paralleled by increased protein levels of these factors in CAFs treated from 1 h to 24 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 1c) or exposed to a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1d). Next, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the induction of GPER by CoCl2 was abrogated (Figure 1e, Additional file 1a), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in CAFs exposed to hypoxic conditions. In order to assess the transduction signaling involved in the aforementioned responses, we determined the rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation (from 15 minutes up to 60 minutes) following the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 2a). Accordingly, we observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation culturing CAFs in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (Figure 2b). Next, the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 30 minutes in the presence of 300 \u03bcM of the ROS scavenger NAC did not induce the ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). Moreover, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER observed treating CAFs for 3 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 was no longer evident in the presence of 300 \u03bcM NAC and 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor PD (Figure 2d). On the basis of these results, it could be argued that hypoxia-induced ROS may trigger the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is involved in the up-regulation of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression.Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs. (a-d) The exposure to 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a, c) or low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 3 h) (b, d) up-regulate the mRNA (a, b) and protein (c, d) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER as evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In RNA experiments, values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. (e) The up-regulation of GPER observed treating CAFs for 6 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. Side panel shows densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.Hypoxia stimulates the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER through ERK1/2 activation in CAFs. The treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a) or the exposure to low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (b) induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is prevented by using 300 \u03bcM of the free radical scavenger NAC (c). (d) Immunoblots of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER from CAFs treated for 3 h with vehicle (-) or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 alone and in combination with 300 \u03bcM NAC or 10 \u03bcM ERK1/2 inhibitor PD. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to ERK/2 or \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cultured under normoxia vs cells treated with CoCl2 or cells cultured under hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the expression of VEGF induced by hypoxiaConsidering the ability of a low oxygen environment to trigger the production of pro-angiogenic factors in solid tumors, we aimed to evaluate whether hypoxia may promote the expression of an important HIF-1\u03b1 target gene like VEGF. As shown in Figure 3a, the treatment with CoCl2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF in a time-dependent manner in both CAFs and SkBr3 breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in a completely different model system, such as HL-1 cardiomyocytes (Additional file 2). Next, CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) activated a VEGF promoter reporter gene which was transfected in CAFs and SkBr3 cells (Figure 3b, c). Notably, the aforementioned transcriptional response to hypoxia was abrogated knocking-down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 3d, e and Additional file 1c, d). CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) promoted also VEGF protein expression in CAFs, as evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4). The induction of VEGF protein levels was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 5 and Additional file 1a, b), further highlighting their involvement in the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia. Analogously, the up-regulation of VEGF protein expression upon exposure to hypoxia in SkBr3 (Figure 6a) and HL-1 cells (Figure 7a) was no longer evident, knocking down the expression of GPER (Figures 6b and 7b and Additional file 1e) and HIF-1 \u03b1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the regulation of VEGF expression induced by hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF. (a) The mRNA expression of VEGF is up-regulated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as evaluated by real-time PCR. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle (-). Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. (b) The VEGF promoter plasmid (pVEGF) is transactivated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 12 h (b) or exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) for 12 h (c). The transactivation of the VEGF promoter observed in SkBr3 cells treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER expression (e). The luciferase activities were normalized to the internal transfection control and values of cells receiving vehicle or cultured under normoxia were set as one-fold induction upon which the activities induced by CoCl2 treatment or hypoxia were calculated. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Images shown are representative of 20 random fields of three independent experiments.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the VEGF promoter and involved in VEGF-mediated tube formation induced by hypoxiaAs HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are required for the hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, we next determined by ChIP assay that HIF-1\u03b1 (Figure 8a) and GPER (Figure 8b) are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter sequence in CAFs exposed to CoCl2 for 1 h. Interestingly, GPER was required for the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of VEGF, as evidenced knocking-down the expression of GPER (Figure 8c). In parallel, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the recruitment of GPER to the HRE site within the VEGF promoter sequence (Figure 8d). Altogether, these findings suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER leads to the hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence. CAFs treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 were submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (a) or anti-GPER (b) antibodies. For knockdown experiments, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPER (c) or with control shRNA and shHIF-1\u03b1 (d), treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 and then submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (c) or anti-GPER (d) antibodies. The amplified sequences were evaluated by real-time PCR. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle vs CoCl2 treatment.On the basis of these data, we then examined whether conditioned medium from hypoxia-stimulated CAFs could promote in HUVECs the formation of tubule-like structures that represent a useful model system for the evaluation of the neoangiogenesis process. In particular, HUVECs were cultured on GFR-Matrigel\u00ae-coated plates which prevent the formation of capillary-like structures, as previously reported. Notably, HUVECs cultured in normoxic medium from CAFs did not assemble into cord-like structures, while HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs maintained in hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h) displayed a complex ramified network of tubules (Figure 9a). Moreover, in HUVECs cultured with hypoxic medium (2% O2 for 12 h) collected from CAFs, which were previously transfected with a shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER, tube formation was no longer observed (Figure 9b, c). The addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF to the hypoxic medium from GPER-silenced CAFs restored the ability to form tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure 9c). The aforementioned findings were quantified and recapitulated in Additional file 3. Next, we determined that the up-regulation of VEGF protein levels in hypoxic medium from CAFs is no longer evident, knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Additional file 4). Hence, these results clearly suggest that VEGF may be considered as a target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced tube formation. Tube formation was evaluated in HUVECs cultured for 2 h in medium collected from CAFs which were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). To this end, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA (a), shHIF-1\u03b1 (b) or shGPER (c) and exposed to hypoxia, as indicated. Tube formation is rescued in HUVECs treated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and cultured in medium from CAFs transfected with shGPER and cultured under hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). Data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFsIn order to further corroborate the stimulatory role exerted by HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in hypoxic conditions, we turned to a different model system. CoCl2 and low oxygen tension (2% O2) induced CTGF up-regulation at both mRNA (Figure 10a) and protein level (Figure 10b, c) in CAFs. Silencing HIF-1\u03b1 as well as knocking down GPER expression, the up-regulation of CTGF upon CoCl2 was abolished (Figure 10d, e). As a biological counterpart, the migration of CAFs cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2) was prevented, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression and rescued, adding CTGF (Figure 10f). Collectively, our data may suggest that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates different biological outcomes in CAFs exposed to hypoxia.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFs. (a) The mRNA expression of CTGF is induced after the stimulation of CAFs with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as indicated. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. The protein expression of CTGF is induced by 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (b) or low oxygen tension (2% O2, for 4 h) (c). The up-regulation of CTGF protein expression observed upon 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 treatment is abrogated silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER (e) expression. The migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) is prevented knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression. Cell migration is rescued in CAFs transfected with shGPER, exposed to hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) and treated with 100 ng/ml CTGF (f). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.DiscussionIn the present study, we provide novel evidence regarding the regulation of VEGF, which plays a fundamental role in mediating hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In particular, our results demonstrate that a low oxygen tension stimulates through the ERK1/2 transduction pathway the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent expression of GPER, which contributes to the regulation of VEGF in both CAFs and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that following hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter region and cooperatively act as a functional complex for the transcription of VEGF. As a biological counterpart, we evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mediate endothelial tube formation in HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs which were previously exposed to hypoxia. Further corroborating these findings, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER regulates the expression of the migratory factor CTGF, which has been acknowledged as a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.HIF-1 is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and acts as a survival factor in hypoxic tumor environment, mainly activating the transcription of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, oxygen consumption, cell migration and invasion. Besides, hypoxia stimulates through HIF-1 the expression of anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic factors that drastically change the biological properties of tumor cells towards malignant features. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that GPER may be included among the HIF-1 target genes as the up-regulation of GPER induced by hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in breast cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. In particular, GPER-mediated the antiapoptotic effects exerted by estrogens in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the adaptation of cancer cells to a low oxygen environment.GPER may be considered as a predictor of cancer malignancy and aggressiveness considering that its expression has been associated with negative clinical features and poor survival rates in diverse types of tumors. Therefore, huge efforts are currently underway to unravel the mechanisms that rule its regulation and function. Indeed, the development and characterization of drugs that target key players of cancer progression like GPCRs, and particularly GPER, are currently innovative topics under investigation.In this context, estrogenic GPER signaling has been shown to trigger relevant biological effects like proliferation and migration in diverse cancer cells and in CAFs derived from breast tumors. Notably, GPER exhibited the peculiar property to act in CAFs as a transcriptional regulator together with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hence leading to the up-regulation of Cyclin D, which has been largely involved in cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has suggested that CAFs may drive cancer phenotype mainly through a paracrine action exerted by the production of various growth factors and chemokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the stromal contribution to the development of a wide variety of tumors has been supported by animal models of cancer pathogenesis and extensive clinical studies. In this vein, it has been shown that malignant cells recruit into the tumor mass diverse stromal components like CAFs, inflammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate towards cancer progression. In particular, CAFs elicit in breast carcinomas relevant biological activities, including the stimulation of new blood vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth, metastasis and poor prognosis. In this context, our present data add a further mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment may promote angiogenesis, as the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling was shown to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Considering that VEGF is one of the most important factors mediating the complex process of angiogenesis, its action has been widely involved in the development of many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been shown that the ectopic expression of VEGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may promote tumor growth in vivo , whereas the blockade of VEGF has been associated with the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude mice. Thus, given the crucial role exerted by VEGF in tumor development and prognosis, a great deal of interest is currently addressed to a better understanding of its regulation and function. In this regard, VEGF was shown to be regulated by hypoxia mainly through HIF-1\u03b1, which may interact with numerous factors to boost VEGF expression. Further extending the current knowledge on the complex regulation of VEGF, our data suggest that GPER may contribute to the HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional responses in hypoxic tumor microenvironment towards new blood vessel formation. Notably, an increased VEGF production was recently shown to parallel an elevated GPER expression in endometrial cancer patients with low survival rates. These data in combination with our findings may suggest that in estrogen-dependent cancer cells diverse molecular mechanisms could converge on the production of cytokines and growth factors, promoting an enhancement of malignant epithelial growth and invasion through autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Interestingly, we have determined that the up-regulation of VEGF relied on HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling also in HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this transduction mechanism may be implicated in additional pathophysiological conditions, such as the hypoxic myocardium. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective role exerted by GPER in stressful conditions following hypoxia. These data in combination with the results obtained in the present study may indicate that GPER could elicit cardiotropic effects also through its ability to regulate the expression of VEGF, which mainly contributes to adaptive responses following myocardial ischemic injury.As it concerns the signaling cascades activated by hypoxia, we here demonstrate that the ROS-mediated ERK1/2 activation is involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression upon low oxygen tension. In this regard, it should be mentioned that ROS play a relevant role in the biological responses to re-oxygenation; however, decreased oxygen levels may be sufficient to trigger HIF-1-dependent gene expression through the ROS production. In addition, the rapid responses to hypoxia are mediated by multiple transduction pathways activated also upon GPER stimulation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the functional cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER, particularly following both hypoxic and estrogenic stimulations. For instance, estrogens regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression and function in a stressful environment, indicating an intricate cooperation between these two main factors mainly involved in tumor progression. Interestingly, in the current investigation, the biological interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER upon hypoxic conditions was corroborated by the up-regulation of an important migratory stimulator and GPER target gene like CTGF. Accordingly, the migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression, hence confirming their contribution to this relevant cell response.The results obtained in the current study may also disclose a unique ligand-independent action elicited by GPER. This issue could be a further attractive topic which remains to be elucidated in future studies.Altogether, our findings recapitulate in CAFs exposed to hypoxia the engagement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling towards the regulation of pivotal genes involved in angiogenic and metastatic processes. Anyway, further studies are required to better define the role exerted by this transduction pathway in diverse pathophysiological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia through the functional interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.ConclusionsWithin the tumor microenvironment exposed to hypoxia, CAFs have been involved in the generation of new blood vessels which mainly support cancer progression. Our current data highlight the stimulatory role exerted by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the multistep process of tumor neoangiogenesis fostered by CAFs. Considering the crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma, the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway may be pointed out as a further biological target towards innovative treatments in breast cancer.AbbreviationsCAFs: Carcinoma activated fibroblasts; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; DAPI: 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EGM: endothelial growth medium; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAP\u03b1: fibroblast activated protein \u03b1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GPER: G-Protein estrogen receptor; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; HREs: hypoxia-responsive elements; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TCA: trichloroacetic acid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEMDF designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the paper.

        "content": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) generates tumor cells with stem cell properties. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) on EMT of cancer cells and to further investigate the mechanisms involved. We demonstrate that conditioned medium from ASCs induces breast cancer cells (4T1) to express mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin, alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Flow cytometry analyses show that ASC-conditioned medium promotes the expansion of CD44high/CD24low cancer stem cells. Soft agar assays using T47D, BT474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells reveals that ASC conditioned medium promotes the anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells. These effects were inhibited by a neutralizing antibody against platelet-derived growth factor-D (PDGF-D). Furthermore, PDGF-D treated breast cancer cells grow faster in a mouse model, and this effect could be neutralized by a PDGF antibody. In conclusion, our data show that tissue-resident stem cells interact with the cancer microenvironment via PDGF-D, induce EMT in the cancer cells in a paracrine fashion, thereby increasing the number of cancer stem cells and increase tumor growth in a PDGF dependent manner. Our findings shed new light on mechanisms where local tissue-resident stem cells are able to promote the growth of breast cancer cells. Possibly this could open up a novel selective therapeutic strategy targeting EMT pathways and the specific communication between tissue-resident normal stem cell and cancer stem cells, assuming that the blockage of PDGF-D pathways is critical for tumor growth but would not affect normal tissue homeostasis.",

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

        "content": "The breast cancer cell line T47D produces factors which show mitogenic activity for 3T3 cells. Here we describe the partial purification of one of these factors and show that it has properties similar to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The T47D factor is a heat-stable hydrophobic protein with a molecular weight of around 30,000, which inhibits the binding of 125I-EGF in a temperature-dependent manner. This 30 kd protein does not act synergistically with PDGF or fibroblast-derived growth factor (FDGF; also PDGF-like) in stimulating DNA synthesis; moreover, like these two factors, its mitogenic activity can be inhibited by an antiserum raised against human PDGF. A PDGF-like growth factor was also found in the serum-free medium of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-157. Since PDGF acts on mesenchymal cells, the production of PDGF-like growth factors by breast cancer cells suggests a basis for the intense stromal reaction seen in human breast cancers.",

        "full_text": "Recent Outbreaks of Atypical Contact Lens-Related Keratitis: What Have We Learned?PurposeTo examine the public health implications of two recent outbreaks of atypical contact lens-related infectious keratitis.DesignA perspective based on the literature and authors\u2019 experience.ResultsThe contact lens-related fusarium and acanthamoeba keratitis outbreaks were both detected by dramatic rises seen in tertiary care centers in Singapore and the US, respectively. Case control studies in both outbreaks each were able to identify a strong association with the use of different contact lens disinfection solutions. Their respective recalls resulted in a steep decline of fusarium keratitis, but not of acanthamoeba keratitis. Early investigations into each solution association implicate components not directly related to their primary disinfectant, but the true pathogenesis remains unknown. However, the number of Acanthamoeba cases individually attributed to each of almost all available disinfection systems exceeds previously understood total US incidence, suggesting other risk factors. Current standards do not require demonstration of anti-acanthamoebal activity. Yet, despite the inclusion of fusarium in mandatory testing for solutions, current pre-market testing was not predictive of the outbreak.ConclusionsThe two recent outbreaks of atypical contact-lens related keratitis have reinforced the value of tertiary care eye care centers in detecting early rises in rare infections and the power of adaptable, well-designed epidemiologic investigations. While fusarium keratitis has significantly declined with the recall of Renu with Moistureloc, the persistence of Acanthamoeba keratitis begs fundamental changes in contact lens hygiene practices, inclusion of acanthamoeba as a test organism and contact lens disinfectant test regimens for all contact lens\u2013related pathogens which are verifiably reflective of end user contact lens wear complications.Recent years have seen two significant outbreaks of contact lens related infection, each associated with the use of a particular contact lens disinfection system. At a glance, these outbreaks have marked similarities in their recognition and investigation which have provided a greater understanding of the influence of these systems on contact lens-related infectious keratitis. At the same time, they have revealed wide gaps in knowledge as to their practical efficacy against infection. Ultimately, however, it is the striking differences which characterize each individual outbreak that provides the most valuable information in their current use and the future design of these systems.Recognition and Investigation of the Contact lens-Related Fusarium OutbreakThese two respective outbreaks of contact lens-related infectious keratitis have been previously well documented. Briefly, the outbreak of Fusarium keratitis was first described in Asia, in particular Singapore, beginning in March of 2005 with concerns raised later that year by Hong Kong health officials. At that time, Khor et al. reported 68 eyes of 66 patients developing Fusarium keratitis in Singapore, 98% of which wore soft contact lenses. All but 4 of the patients (93.9%) reported using any Renu-branded disinfection solution (Bausch & Lomb) with a remarkably high percentage (63.6%) reporting the use of Renu with Moistureloc, only recently introduced into worldwide use in late 2004. Scattered cases were also reported in the United States during the same time frame after its introduction there in 2005. A case-control study of 164 US cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found similarly that 154/164 cases (93.9%) were soft contact lens wearers. Of the 116 patients reporting single solution use, 94 reported Renu with MoistureLoc use (57%). In all, only 13% denied any use of Renu with MoistureLoc. Its use was strongly associated (OR 13.3; 95% CI 3.1\u2013119.5) with contact lens related Fusarium keratitis. This resulted in a regional recall involving Singapore and Hong Kong of Renu with MoistureLoc in February, 2006 followed by voluntary recalls in the US (April, 2006) and globally (May 15th, 2006).Recognition and Investigation of the Contact lens-Related Acanthamoeba OutbreakLess than a year later at the American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting in November 2005, an increasing number of Acanthamoeba keratitis cases (19) identified over the prior year at the Wills Eye Institute were reported. We identified a statistically significant increase in cases at the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary dating back to June 2003 (RR 6.67; 95% CI 3.05 to 17.52), and published an exploratory analysis of the first 40 cases at our institution presenting through November, 2005. In this, we identified a unique geographic distribution of cases in which the population-based rate ratio was higher in peripheral collar counties of Chicago (RR 3.59; 95% CI 1.44\u20138.39) inconsistent with previously known risk factors. Consequently, we initiated a single-center case-control study to investigate the outbreak origins, designing the study to allow for analysis of both environmental and more common lens-related/hygiene risk factors. Through our ongoing discussions with the Illinois Department of Public Health and the CDC, the CDC eventually concluded from a survey of 10 U.S. ophthalmology centers conducted in early 2007 that an increase in culture positive cases was evident beginning in 2004. In May, 2007, both an interim analysis of our ongoing case control study, and an exploratory analysis by the CDC using historical Fusarium keratitis study controls, identified the use of AMO Complete Moisture Plus as a statistically significant risk factor for the development of contact lens-related Acanthamoeba keratitis (OR 16.67; 95% CI 2.11 \u2013 162.63), leading to an immediate worldwide recall (May 29th, 2007).Case Ascertainment and Aggregation of Infectious OutbreaksThe initial reports of Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis were remarkably similar in that both were first identified at tertiary care ophthalmology centers: Singapore National Eye Center, in addition to the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Wills Eye Institute, respectively. The reasons are for this are both obvious and important, with several factors driving these two diseases in particular towards tertiary care facilities and ultimately driving outbreak identification. First, the standard treatment for each infection involves medications not widely available. Although a commercial preparation of natamycin 5% is widely available for the treatment of fungal keratitis, the rate of clinical resistance for Fusarium sp., specifically, is significant. Similarly, standard therapy for Acanthamoeba keratitis either consists of commercial medications unavailable in the U.S. and/or compounded biguanides. Second, the infections are known to masquerade as other either infectious or non-infectious conditions, often requiring the expertise of clinicians and microbiologic facilities familiar with their diagnosis. Third, these infections are often highly symptomatic, with poor outcomes if not promptly and appropriately treated; 17% of the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary Acanthamoeba keratitis patients and 34% of U.S. Fusarium keratitis patients required corneal transplantation. Finally, the rarity of each disease, prior to the outbreaks, facilitated more rapid recognition. Although Fusarium keratitis is the most common filamentous fungal infection in non-contact lens users, it was previously uncommon with contact lens use. And while Acanthamoeba keratitis is primarily restricted to contact lens users, the previous annual U.S. incidence estimates, based on the outbreak of the late 1980\u2019s and roughly our pre-outbreak experience, was ~2 cases per million contact lens users. These infections have remained rare even in the midst of the outbreaks. The annual Fusarium keratitis incidence in Singapore was estimated at 2.4 cases per 10,000 contact lens wearers, and while no comparable Acanthamoeba keratitis incidence rates have been calculated, our gross estimates from the Chicago outbreak approach 20 annual cases per million contact lens users. Hence, it is unlikely that a single ophthalmologist, or even cornea specialist, would be able to acutely detect an outbreak; thus, the importance of tertiary care centers in large metropolitan areas to provide case aggregation and the perspective of a more \u201cpopulation-based\u201d comparison of disease trends with time.Taken together, these four factors made possible a relatively complete case ascertainment at the tertiary care facilities that led to the identification of each outbreak. Without a structured surveillance system for contact lens-related keratitis, or any microbial keratitis, the absence of any of the above characteristics would mask or significantly delay the detection of outbreaks of 1) milder, more easily diagnosed disease; 2) diseases with widely available, effective therapy; or, 3) diseases that are significantly more common than these. The historical recognition that extended wear use of contact lenses was significantly associated with bacterial infectious keratitis, for example, may have been delayed if efficacious antibiotics were available in the community at the time, obviating the need for fortified antibiotics compounded at specialty hospitals where case aggregation could occur. Looking to the future, we likely will have no ability to identify a substantial outbreak of a more common, fluoroquinolone-sensitive, contact lens-related microbial keratitis, due to the successful nature of community-based empiric antibiotic treatment as well as the non-specificity of the utilization patterns for these drugs which have a wide range of both non-therapeutic and non-corneal indications.Unique Epidemiology of the Individual OutbreaksDespite these similarities, there are distinct differences in the epidemiology of each outbreak that offer important lessons in their respective outbreak study design and implementation. In a rare disease such as microbial keratitis, the case-control study design is preferred as it is highly efficient; however, appropriate selection of controls is critical to maintain study validity and prevent the introduction of systemic error, biasing results. Because of the rarity of Fusarium keratitis among contact lens users, baseline incidence and historical risk factors were generally unknown. However, a simple evaluation of the percentage of cases using the recalled solution, as well as a comparison against market share, strongly implicated the role of a single solution. As such, a case-control study designed to investigate contact lens solutions, as well as the potential role of general lens-related keratitis risk factors including lens hygiene, was launched. Controls were selected to allow for analysis of these factors: controls were matched to the neighborhood of cases restricted to contact lens users over the age of 17. Results identified the strong association of Renu with MoistureLoc with Fusarium keratitis as well as the relatively smaller contribution of \u201ctopping off\u201d or solution reuse. This strong association contributed to a worldwide recall, with an immediate reduction in Fusarium keratitis cases identified through both active and passive surveillance techniques.The independent investigations (CDC, the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary) of the Acanthamoeba keratitis outbreak provide further insight. Our initial publication identified a unique geographic distribution of cases in Chicago, suggesting the need for a case-control study design that allowed for analysis of factors that can vary by geography, with solutions potentially less relevant in this outbreak. More reliable Acanthamoeba keratitis incidence estimates further suggested a problem beyond just a single solution: despite a potential signal, no single solution accounted for a strong majority of cases, indicating as much as a five-fold increase in disease regardless of type of solution used (arm-chair epidemiology: 2 vs. 20\u201330 annual cases in Chicago, 40% of cases without AMO Complete MoisturePlus use, hence now 8\u201310 annual cases with all solutions, so up to a 5x increase). Further, Acanthamoebae are found commonly in water and soil, but are considered largely a waterborne pathogen in humans. While many forms of infectious keratitis have been linked to temperature and climate, only Acanthamoeba keratitis has been consistently linked to alterations in the quality of the domestic water supply. Because our initial analysis identified a unique geographic distribution of cases, hypothesized as related to the water supply, we selected a case-control study design in which controls were clinic-based, matched on age and date of visit in order to be able to analyze the effect of geography and the potential effects of water supply, which is inherently impossible when controls are matched by neighborhood. To our benefit, our single-center study design not only allowed for analysis of typical lens-related risk factors, but also restricted potential confounding factors (i.e., Miami weather is more conducive in the winter than Chicago to water-related activities that increase risk of infection).In comparison, the CDC investigation closely mirrored the study design conducted for the Fusarium keratitis outbreak. The initial MMWR alert in May 2007, in which 46 culture positive (39 soft contact lens wearers) Acanthamoeba cases were identified, was based on control data collected during the Fusarium keratitis outbreak the year prior. The potential pitfall is that solution market share changes with time and might not reflect contemporary use, especially given the interim recall of Renu with MoistureLoc solution. Their subsequent outbreak investigation that recruited new controls retained the same study design as the Fusarium keratitis study, with the recruitment of controls that were neighborhood-matched to identified cases.Nevertheless, both independent studies confirmed the significant association of the use of AMO Complete MoisturePlus with Acanthamoeba keratitis (OR 16.67; 95% CI 2.11 \u2013 162.63). Not surprising, given the high frequency of cases that reported use of solutions other than the recalled solution, the number of Acanthamoeba keratitis cases in Chicago and nationally has not returned to baseline, unlike the Fusarium keratitis outbreak that occurred one year prior serving as a wonderful baseline comparison for the Acanthamoeba keratitis outbreak. This indicates the contribution of other, yet unidentified risk factors to the Acanthamoeba keratitis outbreak.Proposed Pathogenesis of Contact-lens Related Atypical KeratitisThe role of the contact lens disinfection systems in each outbreak is still not fully understood. It has been established that no evidence exists in either outbreak to support solution contamination in sealed production lot testing. PCR testing of unsealed solution bottles is not supportive of lot contamination, because it lacks confirmation of the source as well as the viability of the genetic material detected. Further, the diversity of fungal isolates in the CDC study and of Acanthamoeba isolates in the Chicago study makes it highly unlikely that a single source contamination occurred with either solution.Two theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism for an increase in Fusarium keratitis with Renu with MoistureLoc use. In vitro studies indicated that the practice of \u201ctopping off\u201d (solution reuse) concentrates the solution residua in the contact lens case. The resultant film protects the fusarium from disinfection, allowing proliferation and exposing the lens to a sufficient burden of pathogenic fungi. Another theory suggests disinfection efficacy is degraded by high temperature storage, especially since the balance of cases was sourced to a single production/ distribution channel. A lower, but significant number of cases were also seen, however, in other geographic areas, including Europe. Interestingly, compliance with contact lens hygiene is universally, repeatably poor even among healthy controls and cannot change at the population level to cause an outbreak, yet contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis was rare prior to the introduction of Renu with MoistureLoc to the market. The magnitude of the disease increase implied that potentially, a specific solution property may have promoted and amplified the incidence of fusarium infection not previously seen even in severely non-compliant patients, making it unlikely that a lack of efficacy alone would be sufficient to cause this change. This would be most consistent with the theory of \u201ctopping off\u201d facilitated proliferation, but some combination of other factors is also likely.The mechanism of action also remains unclear for the increase in Acanthamoeba keratitis with AMO Complete MoisturePlus use. Speculation has revolved around the additional \u201ccomfort\u201d components added to the prior generation product (AMO Complete) to create AMO Complete MoisturePlus and, in particular, propylene glycol and the amino acid taurine, which, at sufficient concentrations, is well-known to microbiologists to induce transformation of the organism into the highly disinfectant resistant cyst form. Further, results of in vitro testing suggest a relative lack of efficacy of the base disinfectant in AMO Complete MoisturePlus (polyhexamethyl biguanide (PHMB)) when compared to other available systems varying somewhat with testing methodology. Of note, the CDC did not find any indication that a particular lens material was associated with disease, which is important as the substantially new silicone hydrogel contact lens type was also introduced during this time frame.The role of contact lens solutions should not be minimized, but it has become clear that other, more global, risk factors likely underlie the most recent Acanthamoeba keratitis outbreak. As previously mentioned, Acanthamoeba keratitis as compared to all contact types of lens-related infections has been more closely associated with water exposure such as hot tub use, as well as contamination of municipal water. Because Acanthamoeba is not a surveillance organism, the previous levels of Acanthamoeba in domestic water is not well known, but interim results from the University of Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary study have shown that greater than 18% of all homes tested harbored Acanthamoeba (Joslin, CE, et al. IOVS 2010;51:ARVO E-Abstract 1309), far higher than any prior study except one (30%) which tested only taps of infected patients. The only other study performed in the U.S. showed a 2.8% level in South Florida in a normal population. We have previously hypothesized that changes in EPA regulations implemented nationally between 2002 \u2013 2004 could potentially change the microbiologic configuration of the domestic water supply. Regardless, both the initial finding of the non-random distribution of cases in the peripheral collar counties as well as the subsequent shifting distribution of Acanthamoeba keratitis cases over time towards the city are consistent with a geographic risk factor which follows the pattern of water distribution in the Chicago metropolitan area.None of the currently available multipurpose solutions have significant efficacy against acanthamoebal cysts with current one-step hydrogen peroxide solutions demonstrating only partial efficacy. This lack of in vitro activity is supported by the clinical observation that the individual number of cases attributed to each separate multipurpose solution in our study would, in itself, represent an increase over the previously estimated total outbreak incidence of the late 1980\u2019s, when tap water was incorrectly utilized in lens care. The increasing number of cases that we have seen in our cohort with all soft lens solution systems, both multipurpose and one-step hydrogen peroxide solutions, as well as in gas permeable rigid lens users, which utilize different disinfection schemes, suggests that an increasing environmental load is overwhelming the limited ability of existing systems to limit the exposure of pathogenic Acanthamoeba organisms during contact lens wear.The Role of Pre-market Testing of Contact Lens Disinfection SystemsA specific test regimen is mandated by the Federal Drug Administration for approval of contact lens disinfection systems. Briefly, testing involves disinfection efficacy for five organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, and Fusarium solani. Standalone efficacy is determined by a >3 log reduction of bacteria or > 1 log unit reduction of fungi in a test tube. A second regimen test which includes a case, contact lens and organic soil may be required if the solution does not pass the stand-alone test, but passes lower criteria for that test. These established standards had not required testing against Acanthamoeba presumably because of the previously low incidence of disease and controversy over appropriate testing methods.Existing testing methods for contact lens disinfection systems were, however, unable to predict either of these outbreaks. As a new formulation, Renu with Moistureloc passed all required tests and was highly efficacious against the Fusarium species specified. In the hands of contact lens wearers, the majority of whom are variably non-compliant with lens hygiene, a dramatic rise in Fusarium keratitis resulted, demonstrating that in vitro solution efficacy results did not adequately reflect solution effectiveness, or its performance in the \u201creal world\u201d. Further, small, changes seemingly unrelated to a solution\u2019s main disinfectant function may alter its risk for infection. For example, the formulation changes which did not alter the solution\u2019s base disinfectant may have been responsible for unforeseen changes in a solution\u2019s performance against Acanthamoeba organisms. These two outbreaks, which highlighted gaps in existing efficacy testing, were the first steps towards establishing new testing methods initiated at an FDA-hosted workshop in 2009. The implementation is expected to include an expansion in the number of bacterial and fungal test organisms, addition of acanthamoebal strains and changes in testing methodology leading to new disinfection systems.Even still, scant evidence supports a correlation of in vitro testing results and a reduction in infectious keratitis primarily as these relationships have not been, and are difficult, to study. As contact lens wear is the primary risk factor for Acanthamoeba keratitis and also more general forms of bacterial keratitis, a carefully-designed system of post-market surveillance that not only explores solution, lens, and lens hygiene factors, but also carefully explores the contribution of environmental causes, would lead to earlier detection of subsequent outbreaks and help to validate and refine pre-market testing. Further, it may be the only way to detect a significant lack of effectiveness against bacterial organisms not included in the testing panel.Considerations for Current Contact Lens WearersVarious hygiene-related risk factors were evaluated in case-control studies of both outbreaks. While the practice of solution reuse or \u201ctopping-off\u201d, where used solutions are incompletely discarded before refilling the contact lens storage case, was found to be associated with a higher risk of Acanthamoeba keratitis on multivariate analysis in only the CDC study, a role for this practice in the pathogenesis of both contact-lens related Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis has been suggested in multiple studies. These studies also suggest a number of other hygiene-related practices may have a role including a lack of rubbing of contact lenses during the cleaning process, showering in contact lenses, and using lenses beyond their replacement date. These factors may have some clinical utility, but it should be understood that the magnitude of their contributions are likely substantially less than either the identified contact lens solution associations or yet to be identified environmental associations for these outbreaks. As evidence, the recall of Renu with Moistureloc, despite the widespread deficiencies in hygiene found in both cases and controls, was successful in reducing the number of cases of Fusarium keratitis to near baseline.However, if contact lens users are being exposed to a higher level of Acanthamoebae, the options for control are few. Limiting organism exposure should reduce disease incidence. Reducing the environmental load would be ideal, but Acanthamoebae are highly resistant to chlorine-based disinfection and require filtration to exclude it from the water supply. Once ensconced in the water supply, it is unclear whether this remains a modifiable risk factor because of the difficulty in eradicating established biofilms from water distribution systems. Daily disposable contact lens use would limit the potential contamination of contact lens cases as well as minimize hygiene-related water exposure, but other sources of water exposure would remain, including showering. Reusable contact lens users would require contact lens solution systems that are effective against Acanthamoebae. Heat and two-step hydrogen peroxide systems are highly effective against Acanthamoebae as well as most other organisms, but are more complicated to use which may itself further lower compliance. While systems are not expected to completely sterilize lenses, it is evident that none of the current disinfection systems are sufficiently effective to limit Acanthamoeba keratitis under current environmental conditions with existing hygiene standards. Nevertheless, strict adherence to the guidelines of contact lens solution manufacturers which include rubbing of lenses, changing cases at regular intervals, avoiding solution reuse and limiting water exposure (e.g. Showering, hot tub use, swimming) are reasonable cautions to reduce the risk of infection.ConclusionsFor many years, contact lens users enjoyed a period of stability with relatively low rates of largely treatable bacterial keratitis and even lower rates of Acanthamoeba keratitis. The outbreaks of 2006 and 2007 have been a harsh reminder of the unanticipated dangers of contact lens use but have in turn provided us with valuable insights. They have demonstrated the value of tertiary care centers in the early identification of outbreaks of rare keratitides, but raise concerns regarding the future recognition of a similar surge of a more easily treated bacterial keratitis. Both also demonstrate the power of epidemiologic studies in rapidly identifying modifiable risk factors to avert disease, as well as illustrate the need to consider historical risk factors, disease pathogenesis, and early outbreak characteristics in the design of epidemiologic studies. Finally, small changes in the formulation of contact lens solutions may have profound effects on real world effectiveness that may be nearly impossible to account for in studies designed for pre-market testing. Current testing methods were inadequate to predict these two outbreaks, and indicate the need not only for additional, more comprehensive testing, but also methods, including post-market surveillance, to evaluate the validity of these pre-market tests when applied to real consumer use.A multi-country outbreak of fungal keratitis associated with a brand of contact lens solution: the Hong Kong experienceAn outbreak of Fusarium keratitis associated with contact lens wear in SingaporeEpidemiological characteristics of a Chicago-area Acanthamoeba keratitis outbreakAcanthamoeba keratitis multiple states, 2005\u20132007Fusarium keratitis--multiple states, 2006Update: Fusarium keratitis--United States, 2005\u20132006Acanthamoeba keratitis: a parasite on the riseInsurgence of Fusarium keratitis associated with contact lens wearMultistate outbreak of Fusarium keratitis associated with use of a contact lens solutionThe association of contact lens solution use and acanthamoeba keratitisAntimicrobial susceptibility of Fusarium, Aspergillus, and other filamentous fungi isolated from keratitisPrognostic Factors Affecting Visual Outcome in Acanthamoeba KeratitisThe changing spectrum of fungal keratitis in south FloridaFungal keratitis associated with non-therapeutic soft contact lensesThe epidemic of Acanthamoeba keratitis: where do we stand?The incidence of ulcerative keratitis among users of daily-wear and extended-wear soft contact lensesPostrecall surveillance following a multistate fusarium keratitis outbreak, 2004 through 2006National outbreak of Acanthamoeba keratitis associated with use of a contact lens solution, United StatesAcanthamoeba keratitis in England and Wales: incidence, outcome, and risk factorsCorrelation between surface water contamination with amoeba and the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of amoeba-like keratitisAcanthamoeba keratitis: the role of domestic tap water contamination in the United KingdomShifting distribution of Chicago-area Acanthamoeba keratitis casesMoisturePlus contact lens solution as a source of acanthamoeba keratitisGenotypic identification of Acanthamoeba sp. isolates associated with an outbreak of acanthamoeba keratitisGrowth and survival of Fusarium solani-F. oxysporum complex on stressed multipurpose contact lens care solution films on plastic surfaces in situ and in vitroTemperature instability of ReNu With MoistureLoc: a new theory to explain the worldwide Fusarium keratitis epidemic of 2004\u20132006Contact lens-associated fusarium keratitis in SwitzerlandOutbreak of contact lens-related Fusarium keratitis in FranceAcanthamoeba keratitis in soft contact lens wearers.

Recent gene expression profiling studies have shown that this heterogeneous disease is composed of five major biological subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal breast-like. The majority of basal-like breast cancers exhibit a triple-negative phenotype (ER\u03b1\u2212, progesterone receptor-negative (PR\u2212), Her2-neu-negative) and high frequency of p53 mutations. Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive histological subtype with poor prognosis and high rates of relapse following chemotherapy as compared to other subtypes. Nevertheless, studies of neoadjuvent chemotherapy suggest that women with TNBC who have a pathological complete response to treatment achieve excellent outcome (Carey LA 2007, Liedtke C 2008). Unfortunately, disease recurrence is very frequent, and conventional treatments for relapsed patients are limited. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for the development of novel generation of drugs with high efficiency and specificity against this particular group of patients.ER\u03b1 is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which plays major roles in breast carcinogenesis. Indeed, ER\u03b1 signaling pathway is one of the most important pathways in hormone-dependent breast cancer. The amplification of the ER\u03b1 coding gene ESR1 is frequent in various breast tumors as well as in benign and precancerous breast diseases, suggesting that ESR1 amplification may be a common mechanism in proliferative breast disease and a very early genetic alteration in a large subset of breast cancers. Thereby, it\u2019s reasonable to consider ER\u03b1 inhibitors of significant clinical interest.Several dietary phytochemicals have shown promising anti-cancer properties, and have been used as therapeutic agents against various illnesses for centuries. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the major active component of the spice turmeric, has been widely used in traditional medicines for thousands of years. Several in vitro and in vivo studies as well as clinical trials have shown that curcumin has potent anti-cancer effects, and safe even at high doses. However, curcumin exhibits poor aqueous solubility and low absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, which limits its clinical use. To bypass this limitation, several curcumin analogues were synthesized, with the hope to increase the efficacy while preserving the same safety profile. PAC (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-N-methyl-4-piperidone) is a promising anti-cancer curcumin analogue. Indeed, PAC is 5 times more efficient than curcumin in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In the present study we have shown that PAC is more stable than curcumin in PBS and in circulating blood. Furthermore, PAC-dependent cytotoxicity is more potent on ER\u03b1\u2212 cells than ER\u03b1+ cells through down-regulation of ER\u03b1. Moreover, PAC inhibits the pro-metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in breast cancer cells, with higher efficiency on the TNBC subtype. Additionally, PAC suppressed the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of breast cancer cells on breast stromal fibroblasts via suppressing the secretion of two important cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1.MethodsEthics statementAnimal experiments were approved by the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) under the RAC proposal # 2080009, and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Animals suffered only needle injection pain and also certain degree of pain/distress related to the growth/ burden of the tumor. The euthanasia was performed using cervical dislocation.Cells and cell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured following the instructions of the company. NBF-1 are primary normal breast fibroblasts developed from tissues obtained from plastic surgery, and cultured as previously described. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotic and antimycotic solutions, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA).Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. Antibodies directed against Vimentin (RV202), Twist1, N-cadherin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); Akt, phospho-Akt (193H12), Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2 (THR202/TYR204), E-cadherin (24E10) and MCP-1 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); c-Myc from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA); Cyclin D1 (HD11), ER\u03b1 (F-10) and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, FL-335), were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).RNA purification and quantitative RT-PCRGAPDH: 5\u2019-GAGTCCACTGGCGTCTTC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GGGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGT-3\u2019;CCND1: 5\u2019 -TGTTCGTGGCCTCTAAGATGAAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- AGGTTCCACTTGAGCTTGTTCAC-3\u2019c-MYC: 5\u2019- CTTCTCTCCGTCCTCGGATTCT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GAAGGTGATCCAGACTCTGACCTT-3\u2019Total RNA was purified using the TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and was treated with RNase-free DNase before cDNA synthesis using the Advantage RT Kit (Clontech). For quantitative RT-PCR, the RT2 Real-Time\u2122 SYBR Green qPCR mastermix (Qiagen, UK) was used and the amplifications were performed utilizing the Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor Real time PCR detection system. The melting-curve data were collected to check PCR specificity, and the amount of PCR products was measured by threshold cycle (Ct) values and the relative ratio of specific genes to GAPDH for each sample was then calculated. The respective primers are:TransfectionThe pGFP-C-shLenti plasmid bearing ESR1-shRNA or scrambled shRNA (Origene), were used at 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml each for transfection of 293FT cells. Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48\u00a0h post-transfection. Culture media were removed from the target cells and replaced with the lentiviral supernatant and incubated for 24\u00a0h in the presence of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Transduced cells were selected after 48\u00a0h with puromycin (Invitrogen).Bioavailability of PAC and curcuminFor the bioavailability experiments, normal Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20093\u00d75, 25\u00a0g, 3 mice/time point) were intraperitoneally injected with PAC or curcumin (100\u00a0mg/Kg). 400\u00a0\u03bcL blood samples were withdrawn directly from the heart of each mouse into a heparin-rinsed vial at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120\u00a0min post-injection. Each blood sample was centrifuged at 3000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u00a0min. The resulting plasma sample (100\u00a0\u03bcL) was acidified using hydrochloric acid (HCl 6\u00a0N, 10\u00a0\u03bcL) followed by three times extraction with a mixture of ethyl acetate:propanol (9:1, 1\u00a0mL). The extract was then completely dried and re-dissolved in methanol (100\u00a0\u03bcL) before direct injection onto HPLC for analysis. Using a standard curve of PAC and curcumin, the data obtained from analyzed samples were utilized to construct pharmacokinetic curve of PAC/curcumin concentrations in plasma using the Graph Pad Prism software. Separate experiments using the same extraction system were carried out to determine extraction efficiency of PAC and curcumin from plasma and showed a yield of 96\u00a0%.HPLC analysesReversed-phase HPLC were performed on Jasco, HPLC systems using C18 column (10\u00a0\u03bcm, 4.6 \u00d7 250\u00a0mm) (Econosil, Alltech, USA). HPLC was run using a gradient of 0.1\u00a0% TFA in water (solvent A) and 0.1\u00a0% TFA in CH3CN (solvent B) gradient, 0 to 50\u00a0% B, 15\u00a0min, 50 to 50\u00a0% B, 5\u00a0min, 50 to 0\u00a0% B, 5\u00a0min, and 100 to 100\u00a0% A, 5\u00a0min each at flow rate of 1\u00a0mL/min. The HPLC systems are equipped with a UV detector set at 420\u00a0nm, a Flow-count \u03b3-radioactivity detection system (Bioscan, USA) and Lauralite analysis program (LabLogic, UK).Cell migration, invasion and proliferationThese assays were performed as described in detail previously. Cell migration, invasion and proliferation were assessed in a real-time, non-invasive, and label-free manner using the xCELLigence RTCA technology (Roche). Migration and invasion were assessed as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the CIM-plate 16. Briefly, initially 160\u00a0\u03bcl of cell-free complete media, or SFM were added to the lower chamber wells and 30\u00a0\u03bcl of SFM to the upper chamber wells and plates were incubated for 1\u00a0h in the cell incubator to obtain equilibrium. Subsequently, the background signal was measured and exponentially growing cells resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of SFM were seeded in the upper chamber wells with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane (invasion) or without (migration). Cells were seeded at 1\u20133 \u00d7 104 cells/well. After cell addition CIM-plates 16 were incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature in the laminar flow. Subsequently, the plates were locked in the RTCA DP device in the incubator. Each condition was performed in triplicate.For proliferation assays, exponentially growing cells in complete media (0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104/well) were seeded in E-plates as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The rest of the procedure was the same as for the invasion and migration assays. Relative cell migration, invasion and proliferation levels are shown in arbitrary units.Apoptosis analysis by annexin V/flow cytometryCells were either not treated or challenged with PAC or curcumin, and then harvested, centrifuged and stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Alexa Flour 488 annexin V (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) as previously described.Protein arraysSFCM were applied to RayBio the human cytokine array 5 (AAH-CYT-5, RayBiotech, Inc (Norcross, GA, USA) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Signal densities were assessed with the ImageJ software, and data analysis was carried out following the Array protocol\u2019s instructions.Tumor xenograftsBreast cancer xenografts were created in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of MDA-MB-231 cells, and then the animals were treated with PAC (100\u00a0mg/Kg) or DMSO as previously described.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t-test was used for statistical analysis and p values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant.Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24\u00a0h, and then media were collected and briefly centrifuged, and cells were counted. The resulting supernatants (SFCM) were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until needed. SFCM were diluted, when necessary, based on the cell counts.ResultsPAC is more stable than curcumin in PBS and circulating bloodPAC is more stable than curcumin. a Curcumin and PAC structures.

Blood samples were withdrawn directly from the heart of each mouse at the indicated periods of time. The resulting plasma extracts were dried and re-dissolved in methanol before injection onto HPLC for analysis. The error bars represent means +/- SDTo compare the stability of curcumin with that of PAC, we have first studied the stability of both molecules in phosphate buffer (0.1\u00a0M, pH\u00a07.4). PAC and curcumin were incubated in PBS for different periods of time (0, 5, 30\u00a0min), and then were analyzed by HPLC. Both PAC and curcumin were instable in PBS at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, but PAC showed higher stability (Fig.\u00a01a). Indeed, after 30\u00a0min of incubation more than 90\u00a0% of curcumin was decomposed, while only 60\u00a0% of PAC was decomposed (Fig.\u00a01b). This indicates that after 30\u00a0min of incubation PAC was 4 times more stable than curcumin in PBS.In order to test the bioavailability of curcumin and PAC in animals, normal Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u200930) were intraperitonealy injected with PAC or curcumin (100\u00a0mg/Kg). 400\u00a0\u03bcL blood samples were withdrawn directly from the heart of each mouse at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120\u00a0min post-injection. The resulting plasma extracts were completely dried and re-dissolved in methanol (100\u00a0\u03bcL) before injection onto HPLC for analysis. Figure\u00a01c shows that the amount of PAC presents in plasma at 15\u00a0min post-injection reached 35\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, while the level of curcumin was only 10.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The level of PAC further increased in blood reaching its maximum level (40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) 45\u00a0min post-injection, and dropped to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL at 60\u00a0min post-injection, then remained relatively constant during the following 60\u00a0min (Fig.\u00a01c). On the other hand, the level of curcumin decreased in a time-dependent manner reaching a level as low as 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL 120\u00a0min post-injection. This shows that 25\u00a0% of the injected PAC was still in blood 2\u00a0h post-injection, and that PAC is 30 times more stable than curcumin in circulating blood.PAC induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells with higher efficiency on basal-like cellsPAC triggers apoptosis more efficiently in ER\u03b1-negative than in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells. Cells were either sham-treated or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 72\u00a0h, and then cell death was assessed by annexin V/PI in association with flow cytometry. a Charts. b Histogram showing the proportion of cell death (apoptosis\u2009+\u2009necrosis) in each cell line. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05To measure the extent and the nature of cell death induced by PAC on various breast cancer cell lines, the fluorochrome-conjugated annexin V/PI stain test was used and cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer. Different cell lines were used including basal-like, ER\u03b1\u2212 (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, and BT-549), luminal, ER\u03b1+ (MCF-7, T-47D and BT-474), and HER2-enriched, ER\u03b1\u2212 (SK-BR-3). Sub-confluent cells were treated either with DMSO (used as control) or with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 72\u00a0h. Figure\u00a02a shows the presence of four different cell populations after the double staining annexin V/PI and sorting by flow cytometry: live cells (normal) (annexin V-/PI-), early apoptotic cells (Apo) (annexin V+/PI-), late apoptotic cells (Late apo) (annexin V+/PI+) and necrotic cells (Necrotic) (annexin V-/PI+). Importantly, PAC induced cell death mainly by apoptosis in all breast cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02a).Figure\u00a02b presents cell death of different cell lines after treatment with PAC as percentages relative to DMSO-treated cells. The real effect of PAC was obtained by discarding the proportion of dead cells obtained in the control samples from the treated ones for each cell line. In addition, the proportion of total cell death was considered as the sum of necrosis and both early and late apoptosis. 80\u201390\u00a0% of basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, and BT-549) and about 65\u00a0% of HER2-enriched cells (SK-BR-3) underwent cell death in response to PAC (Fig.\u00a02b). While in luminal cells, only 45\u00a0% of MCF-7 cells and 25\u00a0% of T-47D cells died upon PAC treatment (Fig.\u00a02b). This indicates that PAC is cytotoxic against various types of breast cancer cells, and its effect is more potent on the ER\u03b1\u2212 subtype.Specific ER\u03b1 down-regulation sensitizes breast cancer cells to PACER\u03b1 down-regulation potentiates the pro-apoptotic effect of PAC. MCF-7 cells were transfected with vectors containing 3 different ESR1-shRNA sequences (1, 2, 3) or a scrambled sequence (Scbl). a Cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. b Cells were treated with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined using annexinV/PI-Flow cytometry. c Histogram, Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.005To explore the role of ER\u03b1 in PAC-dependent induction of apoptosis, we knocked-down the ESR1 gene in MCF-7 cells using specific ESR1-shRNA, and a scrambled sequence was used as control. Figure\u00a03a shows strong ER\u03b1 down-regulation by the ESR1-shRNA1, while ESR1-shRNA2 and ESR1-shRNA3 had only marginal effects. Similar effect was observed on the ER\u03b1 target c-Myc (Fig.\u00a03a). Subsequently, these cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 3\u00a0days, and then cell death was assessed by AnnexinV/PI as described above. Figure\u00a03b and c shows that while PAC triggered apoptosis in only about 35\u00a0% of cells bearing control-shRNA, ESR1-shRNA2 or ESR1-shRNA3, the proportion of apoptotic cells reached 70\u00a0% in MCF-7 cells expressing ESR1-shRNA1. This shows that ER\u03b1 down-regulation plays a major role in PAC-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.PAC down-regulates ER\u03b1, c-Myc and cyclin D1PAC down-regulates ER\u03b1 and its targets C-Myc and cyclin D1. a Cells were challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for the indicated periods of time, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis utilizing specific antibodies against the indicated proteins. b Cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then total RNA was extracted and used for qRT-PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. c Nude mice bearing sub-cutaneous humanized tumor xenografts were treated with DMSO or PAC, and then cell lysates were prepared from excised tumors and used form immunoblotting utilizing specific antibodies against the indicated proteinsWe then set out to test the effect of PAC on the expression of ER\u03b1 in both types of cells (ER\u03b1 -positive and \u2013negative). To this end, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were exposed to PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and were harvested after different periods of time (0, 8, 24, 48, 72\u00a0h). Cell lysates were prepared and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis using specific anti- ER\u03b1 antibody, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The level of ER\u03b1 decreased in both cell lines, but became undetectable after 24\u00a0h of treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells, while a significant amount of the protein was still present in MCF-7 cells even after 72\u00a0h of treatment (Fig.\u00a04a). The ER\u03b1 protein is a well-known positive regulator of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, two important apoptosis modulators in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PAC on the expression of these two proteins. Figure\u00a04a shows that the levels of both proteins started to decrease after 24\u00a0h of treatment and continue to decline in a time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231. On the other hand, the effect of PAC on cyclin D1 and c-Myc was only marginal in MCF-7 cells (Fig.\u00a04a). To confirm this finding, we tested the effect of PAC on CCND1 and c-MYC mRNAs. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h and total RNA was purified and used for amplification by quantitative RT-PCR using specific primers. Figure\u00a04b shows that while PAC strongly down-regulated both genes in MDA-MB-231 cells, it increased the level of c-MYC and had only marginal effect on cyclin D1 in MCF-7 cells. This confirms the strong effect of PAC on ER\u03b1 in ER\u03b1\u2212 breast cancer cells and indicates that this gene as well as its targets c-MYC and CCND1 might play important roles in the response of these cells to PAC. To further validate these findings we tested the effect of PAC on these three genes in tumor xenografts formed subcutaneously in nude mice upon injection of MDA-MB-231. The immunoblotting shows PAC-dependent down-regulation of the 3 genes in xenogratft tissues isolated from PAC-treated animals as compared to control animals treated with DMSO (Fig.\u00a04c).PAC suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process both in vitro and in vivoPAC suppresses EMT in breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts. a Cells were seeded in E-16 plates for 24\u00a0h, and then were either sham-treated (DMSO) or exposed to PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for the indicated periods of time. Cell proliferation was monitored in real time using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. b Cells were exposed to DMSO or PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then were seeded in the CIM-plate with SFM in the upper wells separated by 8 micron pore size PET membrane with thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (invasion) or without (migration). The lower chambers contained complete media as chemoattractant. Cells were incubated in normal culture conditions for 24\u00a0h and the migration/invasion were determined using the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from 3 different experiments; *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001. c Cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for Immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. d Figure legends as in Fig.\u00a04c\nSince estrogen receptor signaling plays a role in the pro-metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, we sought to investigate the effect of PAC on EMT in both ER\u03b1+and ER\u03b1\u2212 cells. To this end, MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM), and then cell proliferation was assessed using the xCELLigence RTCA technology utilizing the E-plates. Figure\u00a05a shows strong PAC-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, with a more pronounced effect on the ER\u03b1\u2212 cells.Next, we investigated the effect of PAC on the migration/invasion abilities using the xCELLigence RTCA technology utilizing CIM-plate 16. Figure\u00a05b shows that PAC inhibits the migration and the invasion capabilities of both cell lines, with an effect more pronounced on the ER\u03b1\u2212 MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to the ER\u03b1+ MCF-7 cells.To elucidate the molecular basis of this decrease in the migration/invasion abilities, we tested the effect of PAC on the pro-invasive/migratory protein kinases ERK1/2 and AKT. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then cell lysates were prepared and total levels as well as the phosphorylated/active forms of these two proteins were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure\u00a05c shows strong PAC-dependent inhibition of both protein kinases AKT and ERK1/2 in both cell lines, with a higher effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Indeed, the inhibition of ERK1/2 was very strong in the TNBC cells (Fig.\u00a05b). Since the activation of these two protein kinases is part of EMT, we investigated the possible PAC-dependent inhibition of this pro-metastatic process, through testing the effect on the expression of specific mesenchymal and epithelial markers by immunoblotting. Figure\u00a05c shows clear PAC-dependent up-regulation of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, while the levels of all tested mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin and Twist-1) were reduced in both cell lines, but the effect was more pronounced in MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, similar results were obtained in vivo on tumor xenografts upon sub-cutaneous injection of MDA-MB231 cells in nude mice followed by intraperitoneal treatment with PAC (100\u00a0mg/Kg) (Fig.\u00a05d). Indeed, PAC inhibited the two important protein kinases AKT and ERK1/2 and also up-regulated E-cadherin, while it down-regulated the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin and twist1 (Fig.\u00a05d). Together, these results indicate that PAC suppresses the EMT process in breast cancer cells both ER\u03b1 -positive and -negative, with a more potent effect on ER\u03b1- cells.PAC inhibits the expression/secretion of the pro-metastatic MCP-1 and IL-6 cytokinesPAC inhibits the expression/secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1. SFCM from MDA-MB-231 cells either sham treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h were collected and applied onto Human Cytokine Antibody Array membrane. a Blots, the rectangles indicate the spots corresponding to IL-6 and MCP-1, while the arrows indicate differentially expressed cytokines. b Histogram showing secretion levels of the indicated cytokines upon quantification. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. c Cells were exposed to DMSO or PAC, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against the indicated proteinsHuman cytokine antibody arrays were used to detect the differentially expressed cytokines in the conditioned media obtained from MDA-MB-231 cells either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM). This experiment showed the differential expression of several cykokines, including IL-6, MCP-1, IL-5 and angiogenin (Fig.\u00a06a and b). The effect on IL-6 and MCP-1 is of great importance since these two cytokines play important roles in the spread of various types of cancer, including breast carcinomas. Therefore, we tested the effect of PAC on the expression of these two cytokines at the protein level. The immunoblotting analysis shows strong PAC-dependent down-regulation of both IL-6 and MCP-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a06c).PAC suppresses the paracrine effects of breast cancer cells on breast stromal fibroblastsPAC suppresses the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of breast cancer cells. SFCM from MDA-MB-231 cells either exposed to DMSO (DMSO-MDA-SFCM) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) (PAC-MDA-SFCM) was used for indirect co-culturing of NBF-1 fibroblasts cells for 24\u00a0h, and then cell proliferation (a) as well as migration/invasion (b) were assessed using the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System as described in Fig.\u00a04. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from three different experiments; *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001After showing PAC-dependent inhibition of IL-6/MCP-1 expression and secretion from breast cancer cells we sought to test the effect of PAC on the paracrine effects of these cells on breast stromal fibroblasts. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were first either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h. Subsequently, cells were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) for 24\u00a0h, and then serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) were collected and utilized to challenge normal breast stromal fibroblast cells NBF-1 for 24\u00a0h. Proliferation, migration and invasion of stromal fibroblasts were assessed with the xCELLigence RTCA technology. Figure\u00a07a shows PAC-dependent inhibition of the paracrine effects of MDA-MB-231 cells on the proliferation rate of fibroblast cells. Similarly, media conditioned with PAC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells strongly suppressed the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a07b). Together, these results indicate that PAC inhibits the pro-metastatic effects of the highly invasive breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231.DiscussionTriple-negative breast cancers are poorly differentiated, highly malignant and have a poor outcome. Duration of response is usually short, with rapid relapse very common and median survival of advanced disease of just 13\u00a0months, which is much less than the median duration of survival observed in other advanced subtypes. This made TNBC one of the most attractive areas of research in oncology.We have shown here that the newly synthesized curcumin analogue PAC is 4 times more stable than curcumin in PBS and 30 times more stable than curcumin in circulating blood in mice (Fig.\u00a01). This higher bioavailability of PAC is of great importance since the low bioavailability of curcumin limits its potential use in the clinic. Additionally, we present strong evidence that PAC is a potent anti-breast cancer agent with the strongest effects on the TNBC subtype cells. Indeed, PAC exhibited higher cytotoxicity against different TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-20 and BT-549) than luminal cells (MCF-7 and T-47D). Likewise, PAC inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells with higher effect on ER\u03b1\u2212cells than on ER\u03b1+ cells. Interestingly, when ER\u03b1 was down-regulated in MCF-7 cells with specific shRNA, the pro-apoptotic effect of PAC was doubled. This clearly showed that high expression of ER\u03b1 limited PAC cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells, and we hypothesized that PAC-dependent apoptosis could be mediated through ER\u03b1 down-regulation. Therefore, we tested the effect of PAC on the expression of ER\u03b1 in cells that express high and low level of this receptor, and have shown that PAC reduced ER\u03b1 level in both types of cells, but in the ER\u03b1\u2212 cells ER\u03b1 became undetectable, while its level was still high in ER\u03b1+ cells despite its diminution. This provided a meaningful explanation to the higher effect of PAC on ER\u03b1\u2212cells, and corroborated the result obtained by specific down-regulation of ER\u03b1 in cells that express this receptor. This also confirmed our previous results showing that expression of the receptor coding gene ESR1 in ER\u03b1\u2212 breast cancer cells increased their resistance to PAC. Together, these results indicate that PAC-related induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells depends on the cellular level of ER\u03b1. In fact, various laboratory studies demonstrated that reduced estrogen levels induced apoptosis. A cyclopentenone derivative (CTC-35) was also shown to have potent proapoptotic activity in ER\u03b1\u2212 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, green tea EGCG decreased the proliferation rates of breast cancer cells through strong down-regulation of ER\u03b1.PAC-dependent down-regulation of ER\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied with a strong decrease in the level of ER\u03b1 main targets c-Myc and cyclin D1, both in vitro and in vivo. However, c-Myc and cyclin D1 were not down-regulated in MCF-7 cells, and the c-MYC mRNA was rather up-regulated after 24\u00a0h of PAC treatment (Fig.\u00a04b). This difference in the c-MYC mRNA and protein levels upon PAC treatment could result from translational of post-translational regulatory process in MCF-7 cells. c-MYC and cyclin D1 are two major oncogenes, which confer proliferative and anti-apoptosis capacities to breast cancer cells, and are associated with altered sensitivity to endocrine therapy. The c-Myc protein plays a major role in the apoptotic response of breast cancer cells. This protein has been found overexpressed in 45\u00a0% breast tumors. Cyclin D1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in about 50\u00a0% of all breast cancer cases, and its down-regulation is an important target in breast cancer therapy. Therefore, PAC-related targeting of these two oncogenes could be of great therapeutic value.In addition, we have shown that PAC suppresses the EMT process in both ER\u03b1+ and ER\u03b1\u2212 cell lines, with a higher effect on ER\u03b1-negative cells (Fig.\u00a05). EMT is currently considered as pivotal event in the initial step of the metastatic cascade that allows cells to acquire migratory, invasive and stem-like properties. Evolving evidence indicates that ER\u03b1 signaling can directly regulate EMT-related transcriptional factors, indicating that ER\u03b1 might be a key regulator of the EMT program. PAC inhibited the migration/invasion abilities of breast cancer cells through inhibiting the ERK1/2 and AKT protein kinases, and repressed the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin. Similar effects were also observed in vivo on tumor xenografts, wherein PAC increased the expression of E-cadherin and repressed N-cadherin, vimentin, AKT and Twist1. Similarly, it has been previously shown that curcumin plays an important role in the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced EMT in breast cancer cells through the down-regulation of NF-kB-Snail activity.In addition to their high migratory and invasiveness capacities, ER\u03b1\u2212 cells secrete high amounts of pro-metastatic cytokines such as IL-6 and MCP-1, which can activate stromal cells including fibroblasts. Interestingly, PAC reduced the secreted levels of several cytokines including IL-6 and MCP-1 from MDA-MB-231 cells. This repressed the paracrine pro-replicative and -invasive/migratory effects of these highly invasive cells on breast stromal fibroblasts. This shows the ability of PAC in inhibiting the pro-metastatic capabilities of MDA-MB-231 cells. Indeed, there exists abundant evidence demonstrating that active stromal fibroblasts play major roles in breast cancer progression and spread. These cells escort cancer cells through the whole carcinogenesis process. Therefore, targeting active stromal fibroblasts or blocking their cross-talk with cancer cells is a promising therapeutic approach.ConclusionsWe have shown here that PAC has better bioavailability than curcumin. Moreover, we present clear evidence that PAC down-regulates ER\u03b1 and triggers apoptosis in breast cancer cells with higher efficiency on receptor negative cells. Furthermore, PAC suppressed the prometastatic features of the invasive breast cancer cells by suppressing EMT and the paracrine effect on breast stromal fibroblasts. This makes PAC as a valuable candidate for the future armada against the devastating TNBC type of tumors.AbbreviationsATCC, American type culture collection; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; ER\u03b1, estrogen receptor alfa; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; shRNA, short hairpin RNAReferencesGlobal breast cancer: the lessons to bring homeCancer statistics, 2012Molecular portraits of human breast tumoursDissecting the heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: disease entity or title of convenience?Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene amplification is frequent in breast cancerChemosensitization and radiosensitization of tumors by plant polyphenolsPlants vs. cancer: a review on natural phytochemicals in preventing and treating cancers and their druggabilityRecent developments in delivery, bioavailability, absorption and metabolism of curcumin: the golden pigment from golden spicePAC, a novel curcumin analogue, has anti-breast cancer properties with higher efficiency on ER-negative cellsBreast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their counterparts display neoplastic-specific changesThe p16INK4a tumor suppressor controls p21WAF1 induction in response to ultraviolet lightp16 inhibits the pro-metastatic potentials of osteosarcoma cells through targeting the ERK pathway and TGF-beta1p16(INK4a) positively regulates cyclin D1 and E2F1 through negative control of AUF1MYC and breast cancerIL6-mediated suppression of miR-200c directs constitutive activation of inflammatory signaling circuit driving transformation and tumorigenesisTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceTriple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: molecular features, pathogenesis, treatment and current lines of researchTackling the diversity of triple-negative breast cancerEstrogen regulation of apoptosis: how can one hormone stimulate and inhibit?Induction of apoptosis in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells by natural and synthetic cyclopentenones: role of the IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB pathwayIn vitro mechanism for downregulation of ER-alpha expression by epigallocatechin gallate in ER+/PR+ human breast cancer cellsDownstream targets of growth factor and oestrogen signalling and endocrine resistance: the potential roles of c-Myc, cyclin D1 and cyclin ERole of c-myc in tamoxifen-induced apoptosis estrogen-independent breast cancer cellsProtein expression and molecular analysis of c-myc gene in primary breast carcinomas using immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reactionCyclin D1 oncoprotein aberrantly accumulates in malignancies of diverse histogenesisIdentification of cyclin D1- and estrogen-regulated genes contributing to breast carcinogenesis and progressionBreast cancer progression: controversies and consensus in the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and EMTERalpha suppresses slug expression directly by transcriptional repressionERalpha signaling through slug regulates E-cadherin and EMTEstrogen receptor silencing induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer cellsEstrogen receptor alpha mediates epithelial to mesenchymal transition, expression of specific matrix effectors and functional properties of breast cancer cellsCurcumin inhibits LPS-induced EMT through downregulation of NF-kappaB-Snail signaling in breast cancer cellsThe cytokine IL-6 reactivates breast stromal fibroblasts through transcription factor STAT3-dependent Up-regulation of the RNA-binding protein AUF1CCL2 mediates cross-talk between cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts that regulates breast cancer stem cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts are a promising therapeutic targetThe impact of tumor stroma on drug response in breast cancer"

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

        "content": "Carcinoma are complex societies of mutually interacting cells in which there is a progressive failure of normal homeostatic mechanisms, causing the parenchymal component to expand inappropriately and ultimately to disseminate to distant sites. When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to cancer associated fibroblasts in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. The interaction of tumor cells with stromal fibroblasts influences tumor biology by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Here, we report a role for normal stroma fibroblasts in the progression of invasive tumors to metastatic tumors. Using a coculture system of human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a) and normal murine dermal fibroblasts, we found that medium conditioned by cocultures of the two cell types (CoCM) increased migration and scattering of MCF10CA1a cells in vitro, whereas medium conditioned by homotypic cultures had little effect. Transient treatment of MCF10CA1a cells with CoCM in vitro accelerated tumor growth at orthotopic sites in vivo, and resulted in an expanded pattern of metastatic engraftment.

When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to cancer associated fibroblasts in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. The interaction of tumor cells with stromal fibroblasts influences tumor biology by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Here, we report a role for normal stroma fibroblasts in the progression of invasive tumors to metastatic tumors. Using a coculture system of human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a) and normal murine dermal fibroblasts, we found that medium conditioned by cocultures of the two cell types (CoCM) increased migration and scattering of MCF10CA1a cells in vitro, whereas medium conditioned by homotypic cultures had little effect. Transient treatment of MCF10CA1a cells with CoCM in vitro accelerated tumor growth at orthotopic sites in vivo, and resulted in an expanded pattern of metastatic engraftment. The effects of CoCM on MCF10CA1a cells were dependent on small amounts of active TGF-\u03b21 secreted by fibroblasts under the influence of the tumor cells, and required intact ALK5-, p38-, and JNK signaling in the tumor cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can modify the acellular component of the local microenvironment such that it induces long-lasting increases in tumorigenicity and alters the metastatic pattern of the cancer cells in vivo. TGF-\u03b2 appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-\u03b2 pathway.IntroductionCarcinoma are complex societies of mutually interacting cells in which there is a progressive failure of normal homeostatic mechanisms, causing the parenchymal component to expand inappropriately and ultimately to disseminate to distant sites. As much as 50% or more of tumor bulk consists of non-parenchymal cells often referred to as the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells, cells of the microvasculature, and fibroblasts. Cells of the tumor parenchyma and stroma engage in extensive cross-talk, and the composition of the stroma and the nature of tumor stromal interactions change over time with tumor progression. Tumor-stroma cross-talk influences tumor growth by regulating angiogenesis, suppressing or subverting host immune responses, modulating extracellular matrix, and secreting signaling molecules which then in turn act on cells to further alter cell physiology and to change the composition of the cellular and acellular tumor microenvironment.Fibroblasts are ubiquitous stromal cells which influence other cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. The response of tumor parenchymal cells to fibroblasts depends on many factors, including the nature and extent of the oncogenic lesions in the tumor cells, and the age and activation state of the fibroblasts.While fibroblasts can have tumor suppressing activity the phenotype of the fibroblast changes to a tumor promoting state as carcinogenesis progresses. This process occurs in two stages, generating first reversibly \u201cprimed\u201d and then irreversibly modified fibroblasts with tumor-promoting properties. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) have properties distinct from normal fibroblasts and actively promote tumorigenesis in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer. Typically CAFs have an activated phenotype, expressing smooth muscle actin and showing increased motility. CAFs secrete tumor promoting effectors such as SDF-1, HGF, and TGF-\u03b2 into the tumor microenvironment, and they overproduce extracellular matrix, which contributes to tumor rigidity and an altered signaling context thus further promoting tumor progression. Thus, the phenotype of local fibroblasts can persistently be altered by complex reciprocal parenchymal-stromal interactions that occur during cancer progression.TGF-\u03b2s are pleiotropic growth factors that play important roles in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. Cells release latent TGF-\u03b2 into the microenvironment that upon activation binds to specific serine-threonine kinase receptors. A heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor and the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor (ALK5) then activates intracellular signaling cascades that include the canonical Smad2/3 signaling path and additional pathways such as TAK1-mediated p38- or JNK signaling. Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been implicated in the carcinogenic process in many organs. In the course of cancer progression, TGF-\u03b2s frequently switch from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoting role. In the embryo, expression of TGF-\u03b2 is frequently seen at sites where critical mesenchymal-epithelial interactions occur, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2s may act as an important messenger between these two compartments. In support of such a role, genetic loss of response to TGF-\u03b2 in fibroblasts is associated with aberrant expression of growth factors and cytokines by the fibroblasts and results in the development of premalignant and malignant lesions in several overlying epithelia in stomach, prostate and breast. However, forced overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 primes fibroblasts to promote the outgrowth of initiated human breast epithelial cells. These genetic approaches imply the existence of very delicately balanced TGF-\u03b2-based homeostatic interactions between fibroblasts and the epithelial parenchyma.When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to CAFs in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. Here, we have asked whether the transient interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can induce phenotypic changes in the tumor cell that then affect its malignant properties. We provide evidence that such an interaction induces the secretion and/or activation of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts, which can enhance the malignant behavior of the tumor cells in vivo.ResultsMedium Conditioned by Cocultures of Fibroblasts and Tumor Cells Induces Cell Scattering in Tumor CellsWe investigated the crosstalk between human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a hereafter referred to as CA1a) and fibroblasts (DF) in a two-dimensional coculture system. Cocultures of CA1a and DF formed an organized structure of tumor cell islets that were surrounded by elongated fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Using CA1a cells and DF that were stably infected to report activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of fluorescent protein, we found that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated in both tumor and stromal cells in the cocultures, as compared to much lower levels of activation in the homotypic cultures (Fig. 1A). This observation suggested that cocultures might exhibit emergent properties that were not present in the homotypic cultures. To address the effect of coculturing on secreted components of the tumor microenvironment, we used conditioned media from 4 d old homotypic cultures or cocultures to stimulate CA1a cells that had not been previously exposed to any conditioned media. In scratch assays medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) significantly accelerated closure of the cell-cleared area as compared to medium conditioned by tumor cells (TuCM), fibroblasts alone (FbCM), or unconditioned control medium (medium) (Fig. 1B,C). A similar result was seen when we treated tumor cells that had been plated as a tight colony and assessed migration of cells out of the colony (dot assay). This assay format more closely mimics the migration of tumor cells out of a tumor into the surrounding environment, and eliminates the wounding aspect of the scratch assay. In dot assays CoCM caused scattering of tumor cells from the edges of the colony, whereas colonies treated with homotypic media retained a defined closed edge (Fig. 1B). While CoCM increased migration of CA1a cells, proliferation of CA1a cells was unaffected by treatment with CM (Fig. S1A). At the cellular level, CoCM caused translocation of E-cadherin to the cytoplasm of CA1a cells whereas E-cadherin remained localized at the cell membrane of CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 1B, D). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts causes secretion of a soluble factor that increases cell scattering and migration of tumor cells.Cocultures of breast cancer cells are well organized and increase motility of tumor cells.\nA.\nUpper panel. Human breast cancer cells (CA1a) and mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) form a well organized 2D coculture where fibroblast streaks surround tumor cell islets. Middle panel. Use of fibroblasts and CA1a cells that report Smad3 dependent TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of RFP and GFP, respectively, demonstrates that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell types is increased in cocultures as compared to the homotypic cultures. Bottom Panel. Outline of the tumor cell and fibroblast compartments of the images shown in the middle panel. B. Medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) as compared to medium from homotypic fibroblast (FbCM) and tumor cell (TuCM) cultures increases cell migration and cell scattering in scratch assays (24 h) and dot assays (4 d), and induces cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin as visualized by confocal microscopy (60 min). C. Influence of CoCM on closure of in vitro wounds (\u201cscratch assay\u201d). Cells were plated to confluence, mitosis inhibited by preincubation with mitomycin, and cells then stimulated with conditioned media. CoCM causes significantly faster closure of scratches as compared to all other conditioned media (scratch width after 24 h, n\u200a=\u200a8 samples/group, ANOVA/Bonferroni; p<0.0001). D. Quantification of E-cadherin related immunofluorescence in CA1a cells treated with CM (Fig. 1B). Membranes and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of membrane and cytoplasmic signal were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p\u200a=\u200a0.0052).Cell Scattering Induced by Coculture Conditioned Medium Depends on Active TGF-\u03b2 Synthesized by FibroblastsCell scattering can be induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, and so we tested the effect of candidate factors in the dot assay. Only TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml, Fig. 2A) but not other growth factors such as EGF (Fig. 2A, 25 ng/ml to 250 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml), HGF (5 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml), latency associated protein (LAP, 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) or activin A (0.1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml), induced scattering of CA1a cells in dot assays. To address whether endogenous TGF-\u03b2 might be the factor in CoCM that induces scattering, we used two different Smad-reporter systems to analyze if CA1a cells respond to TGF-\u03b2 in the CM and to sensitively report on the presence of active TGF-\u03b2 in the conditioned media. CoCM induced higher Smad3- and Smad2-mediated luciferase activity than did TuCM, FbCM, or medium, demonstrating that CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2 increases TGF-\u03b2 signaling in tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, CoCM contained higher levels of active TGF-\u03b2 (194\u00b139 pg/ml) than the other conditioned media (TuCM: 94\u00b16 pg/ml, FbCM: 106\u00b122 pg/ml, medium: 0 pg/ml, Fig. 2C) as assessed by activation of a PAI-luciferase reporter activity in CCL64 cells.TGF-\u03b2 signaling induces scattering of CA1a cells.\nA. Exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and fibroblast-released TGF-\u03b2 induces cell scattering in dot assays. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated over night, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), or vehicle (Control) for 4 d. Use of CoCM that was derived from cocultures of CA1a cells and TGF\u03b21 knockout fibroblasts (CoCM(KO)) did not stimulate cell scattering while conditioned medium from cocultures employing TGF-\u03b21 wildtype fibroblasts (CoCM(WT)) did induce cell scattering. B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces higher levels of CAGA (Smad3) and ARE (Smad2) mediated luciferase activity in CA1a cells (n\u200a=\u200a3, ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison, p\u200a=\u200a0.0002 (ARE) and p<0.0001 (CAGA)). C. CoCM contains higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 than TuCM and FbCM. CCL-64 cells were stimulated with CM overnight and PAI-driven luciferase activity was measured. D. Scattering of CA1a cells is induced by addition of 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 to medium. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated overnight, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (0.2 ng/ml) or vehicle for 4 d.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 can induce scattering of CA1a cells in concentrations similar to those secreted by cocultures into the CoCM. To do this we stimulated CA1a with medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 and observed that that this low level of TGF-\u03b2 was sufficient to induce tumor cell scattering (Fig. 2D). Likewise, Smad3 driven GFP expression of the CAGA\u223cGFP reporter was increased by stimulation of CA1a cells with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. S2A). These results indicate that the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 that is secreted by cocultures into the culture medium (CoCM) is sufficient to stimulate cell scattering of CA1a cells.To ask whether this effect was limited to CA1a cells or was more universal we stimulated MCF-7 cells and T47D cells which form adherent cell colonies in culture with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 or CoCM. Both, 0.2 ng/ml exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and CoCM, were capable of inducing scattering of MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. S3), indicating that low concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 as found in CoCM can increase motility of several breast cancer cell lines.Since tumor cells as well as fibroblasts can secrete TGF-\u03b2, we went on to identify the source of TGF-\u03b2 in our coculture system. While medium obtained from cocultures of CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice stimulated scattering of CA1a cells, coculture medium from CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from TGF-\u03b21-null mice did not induce scattering of CA1a cells (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts induces production or activation of TGF-\u03b21 by fibroblasts that then stimulates scattering of the tumor cells.CoCM Stimulates Canonical and Noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 Signaling in CA1a CellsThe TGF-\u03b2 signaling network includes canonical signaling via Smad2/3 as well as non-canonical signaling cascades. Non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling via MAPK pathways can be mediated by TAK1 that then activates JNK- and p38-signaling (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis showed that Smad2, Smad3 and TAK1 were phosphorylated to a greater extent by stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM than by stimulation with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 3A), indicating activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM. On a cellular level, CoCM induced nuclear translocation of Smad2/3in CA1a cells as demonstrated by immunostaining (Fig. 3B,C). This and the induction of Smad2 and Smad3 dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B) further demonstrate that CoCM activates canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells. Similarly, immunofluorescence showed significantly increased levels of proteins of the p38 signaling cascade (phospho-p38, phospho-ATF-2, and phospho-MAPKAPK2) and of phospho-JNK in CA1a cells stimulated with CoCM as compared to CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 4A,B). These data demonstrate that canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are activated upon stimulation of CA1a with CoCM.CoCM activates Smad2/3-signaling and the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK in CA1a cells suggesting activation of canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2.\nA. TGF-\u03b2 activates canonical signaling via Smad2/3 and non-canonical signaling via TAK-1 relayed JNK- and p38 signaling cascades. CoCM stimulated both, phosphorylation of TAK1, and phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3. Cells were incubated with CoCM for 30 min (pTAK1) or 60 min (pSmad2, pSmad3). B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces nuclear localization of Smad2/3 within 60 min, indicating activation of canonical Smad signaling upon stimulation with CoCM. C. Quantification of Smad2/3 mediated immunofluorescence in CM treated CA1a cells (Fig. 2B). Nuclei and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001, n\u200a=\u200anumber of cells analyzed).CoCM activates the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK signaling in CA1a.\nA. Stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM as compared to FbCM and TuCM for 60 min increases levels of phospho-p38 (pp38), pATF-2, pMAPKAPK-2, and pJNK as visualized by fluorescence microscopy, indicating that CoCM activates these non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades. For quantification of pp38-, pATF-2-, pMAPKAPK2- and pJNK mediated immunofluorescence cells were gated and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001 [pp38], p<0.0001 [pATF-2], p<0.0001 [pMAPKAPK2], p<0.00001 [pJNK]). 30 to 40 cells were analyzed per group. B. Inhibitors were added to cultures 30 min prior to stimulating CA1a cells with CoCM for 60 min. E-cadherin was visualized by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. For quantification of E-cadherin mediated the cell membrane and the cytoplasm were gated for each cell and average signal intensities were determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnetts's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001. n \u200a=\u200a number of cells analyzed in each group.Likewise, medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 induced increased levels of pSmad2, pTAK1, MKK3/6, pJNK, pp38, pATF-2, and pMAPKAPK2 in Western blotting (Fig. S2B), indicating that the TGF-\u03b2 concentration that is found in CoCM (0.2 ng/ml) can not only stimulate cell scattering (Fig. 2D), but also is sufficient to activate canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades in CA1a cells.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling is necessary for CoCM induced cell scattering and blocked ALK5, JNK, and p38 signaling during stimulation of CA1a with CoCM. The ALK5 inhibitor SB431542, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4B) all abolished tumor cell scattering induced by CoCM. On a cellular level, those same inhibitors reduced cytoplasmic translocation of E-cadherin induced by CoCM (Fig. 4B), again indicating that both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are involved in CoCM induced cell scattering. Hence, CoCM stimulates tumor cell scattering via activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling.CoCM Causes Increased Tumor Growth and Metastasis In Vivo Cell migration and cell scattering are in vitro correlates of increased tumor cell malignancy. Thus, we next asked if the transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM alters in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of CA1a cells. First we treated CA1a cells with CoCM for 4 d in vitro, and then we washed, trypsinized, and injected cells into the mammary fat pads of SCID mice (Fig. 5A). The ex vivo pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM significantly accelerated primary tumor growth at the orthotopic site when compared to CA1a cells treated with TuCM, FbCM or medium alone (Fig. 5B).CoCM increases tumorigenicity and expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells.\nA. Experimental design of orthotopic implantation- and tail vein injection models. CA1a cells were pre-treated ex vitro with CM for 4 days, trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in DPBS. Orthotopic Implantation Model. 4\u00d7104 cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor size was assessed thrice weekly using calipers. Estimated tumor volumes were calculated by the formula (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail Vein Injection Model. 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS were injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice, and animals were monitored twice weekly for signs of metastasis. B.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM accelerates growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors in vivo. The axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice were bilaterally inoculated with CA1a cells that were pre-treated with CM (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor volumes at day 23 were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Kruskal Wallis test/Dunn's multiple comparison; p<0.001; CoCM vs TuCM: ***, CoCM vs FbCM: **, CoCM vs medium: ***, TuCM vs FbCM: N.S., TuCM vs medium: N.S., FbCM vs medium: N.S.. Representative of 2 independent experiments. C.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM results in extrapulmonary metastases in tail vein injection assays. CA1a cells were incubated with conditioned media for 4 days and injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice. While all animals developed lung metastases, only animals injected with CoCM treated CA1a cells developed extrapulmonary tumors. Extrapulmonary tumor growth was suppressed when TGF-\u03b2 signaling was inhibited by the ALK 5 inhibitor SB431542 during exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM. Animals receiving CoCM pre-treated cells had significantly higher occurrence of extrapulmonary tumors than all other groups (Chi Square Test, tail vein injection #1: p\u200a=\u200a0.0002; tail vein injection #2: p\u200a=\u200a0.0085). D. Functional TGF-\u03b2 signaling of tumor cells is required for CoCM induced formation of extrapulmonary metastases. Blocking of ALK5 mediated TGF-\u03b2 signaling by the ALK5-inhibitor SB435142 during in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM inhibited metastases and significantly increased survival time of animals in vivo (median survival: CoCM: 62 days (n\u200a=\u200a13 animals), SB431542: 96 days (n\u200a=\u200a14 animals), Kaplan Maier Analysis, p<0.0001).The metastatic potential of CoCM treated cells was explored by injection into the tail vein of NOD SCID mice because the CA1a cell line does not metastasize efficiently from the orthotopic site. Additionally this assay format allows metastatic efficiency to be assessed independently of any effect of the experimental intervention on tumor development at the primary site. Mice in all experimental groups developed metastatic colonies of CA1a cells in the lung (Fig. 5C) and no differences of the number of lung colonies were found between the CoCM- and other treatment groups at day 40 after injections of tumor cells (Fig. S4); however, we observed a fairly high frequency of tumor colonization at extrapulmonary sites exclusively in animals that were injected with tumor cells that had been pre-treated with CoCM (Fig. 5C). Extrapulmonary tumors were seen at subcutaneous sites in the proximity of axillary and inguinal mammary fat pads, and in the thoracic wall. Histologically, subcutaneous metastatic tumors resembled the xenografted primary tumors (Fig. 6A, B).CoCM expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells and induces sustained TGF-\u03b2 signaling via pSmad2.\nA. Extrapulmonary tumors formed by CoCM pre-treated CA1a cells after tail vein injection were highly invasive. Extrapulmonary tumors were observed in the subcutaneously, often in the proximity to mammary fat pads (arrows indicate a normal mammary duct, hematoxylin-eosin staining). B. Xenograft tumors and extrapulmonary metastatic tumors derived from CoCM pre-treated cells have higher levels of nuclear pSmad2 than xenograft tumors derived from medium pre-treated CA1a cells as shown by immunostaining. Levels of pSmad2 in xenograft and metastatic tumors were higher in CA1a cells invading the surrounding tissue (arrows) as compared to tumor cells in the center of tumors. The negative control was obtained by omitting the primary antibody. C. Nuclear pSmad2 is increased in tumor cells at the tumor stroma border (arrows) as compared to cells in the center of tumors that spontaneously developed in a C3(1)TAg model of breast cancer and in an orthotopic syngeneic model of breast cancer (4T1 cells/BALB/c mice).We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 was the component of the CoCM that was responsible for the expanded metastatic range of CA1a cells treated with CoCM. To do this we included the ALK5 kinase inhibitor SB431542 during the 4 day pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM. After washing away the SB431542 together with the CoCM, the CA1a cells were injected into NOD SCID mice using the same experimental design as before. Ex vivo incubation of CA1a cells with CoCM and SB431542 as compared to CoCM, resulted in significantly increased survival rates in tail vein metastasis assays (Fig. 5D). Again, we observed that animals injected with CoCM treated cells or with CoCM + SB435142 treated cells equally developed lung metastases (Fig. 5C), and when re-plated in regular culture medium, proliferation of CA1a cells pre-treated with CoCM was equal to proliferation of CA1a cells pretreated with CoCM +SB431542, indicating that SB431542 did not negatively influence proliferation or survival of pre-treated cells (data not shown). However, only 1/14 animal injected with CoCM + SB431542 developed an extrapulmonary tumor, while 5/15 animals that were injected with CoCM treated tumors developed extrapulmonary tumors in tail vein assays (Fig. 5C). Thus, a transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM and consequent activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in these cells not only durably increases tumorigenicity but also permits successful colonization of a wider range of target tissues.Active TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Sustained in Tumors Originating from CoCM Treated CellsWe next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells is durably increased in vivo after stimulation of CA1a cells with TGF-\u03b2 containing CoCM in vitro. Nuclear pSmad2 levels were higher in xenograft tumors or metastatic tumors originating from CoCM treated cells than in xenograft tumors originating from medium treated cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells by treatment with CoCM is sustained in vivo, indicating that the transient exposure of CA1a cells to elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels causes a durable change in TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity.TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Increased at the Tumor - Stroma Border of Tumors in Several Mouse ModelsNext, we investigated whether TGF-\u03b2 signaling is increased when tumor cells invade the fibroblast-containing stroma surrounding a primary tumor as would be predicted from our observations. Immunostaining of pSmad2 in sections of mammary tumors derived from different mouse breast cancer models (CA1a xenograft tumors, syngeneic mouse mammary tumor (4T1), and tumors from the C3(1)TAg transgenic model) revealed that pSmad2 levels are higher in cells at the tumor stroma border, and particularly in those cells invading the surrounding stroma, as compared to tumor cells in the center of the tumor (Fig. 6C). Thus, activation of pSmad2 naturally occurs when tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma.Taken together, our results imply that tumor cells, once they traverse through the surrounding stroma, can subvert normal fibroblasts to increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in the microenvironment that then induces tumor cell migration, cell scattering, and an expanded metastatic pattern, thereby boosting the malignancy of tumor cells (Fig. 7).Tumor-stroma interactions increase malignancy of tumor cells by bidirectional effects of TGF-\u03b2.Direct interactions of tumor cells and fibroblasts as they occur when parenchymal tumor cells invade the underlying stroma increase secretion of TGF-\u03b2 by tumor cells as well as by fibroblasts. TGF-\u03b2 has bidirectional effects on both cells types. Fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2 can directly stimulate tumor cell migration and malignancy. Tumor cell derived TGF-\u03b2 induces fibroblasts to secrete MMP-9. Increased MMP-9 levels then might further increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2, and also facilitate matrix degradation and migration of tumor cells, further increasing the malignant potential of tumor cells.DiscussionInteractions between tumor cells and the fibroblasts of the tumor microenvironment are complex, reciprocal and stage-dependent. Here we have shown that transient interactions of breast carcinoma cells with normal fibroblasts in vitro can increase tumor cell malignancy and expand the metastatic range of tumor cells in vivo by a TGF-\u03b2 dependent mechanism. Specifically, the interaction of human breast carcinoma cells with normal murine fibroblasts induces aberrant secretion of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. This transient exposure of tumor cells to fibroblast-derived TGF-\u03b2 then durably increases tumorigenesis even when the two cell types are no longer interacting. Thus, tumor cells traversing through connective tissue may exploit their transient interaction with normal fibroblasts so as to get a boost in the metastatic process (Fig. 7). This phenomenon has a number of interesting features that are discussed below.Emergent Properties and Reciprocity in the Co-CulturesThe interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can generate emergent system properties that are not seen when the cells are cultured separately. Our experimental design allowed us to focus specifically on the impact of this interaction on the tumor cells, and to start to identify soluble mediators. We showed that co-culture of the two cell types significantly increased the levels of fibroblast derived active TGF-\u03b2 in the extracellular environment, and that this TGF-\u03b2 subsequently enhanced migration of the tumor cells in vitro and malignant behavior in vivo. It has been previously proposed that tumor cells can induce a reversibly \u201cprimed state\u201d in normal fibroblasts, in which the fibroblasts can promote tumorigenesis even though they do not have all the characteristics of the irreversibly modified CAFs. Our data suggest that such priming may involve cancer cell-induced production of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. It is likely that TGF-\u03b2 produced by these primed fibroblasts contributes to the elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels that are seen in the vicinity of many advanced human tumors.Co-cultures of fibroblasts and tumor cells showed increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell compartments, consistent with the presence of activated TGF-\u03b2 in the CoCM (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the tumor cell compartment in this co-culture model can induce MMP-9 secretion by fibroblasts in a Smad-, ras- and PI3K dependent fashion. In the present work, we demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the fibroblast compartment enhanced the migration of tumor cells through the activation of Smad-, p38- and JNK-signaling cascades. Together the data suggest that TGF-\u03b2-mediated signaling between the tumor cells and fibroblasts is bidirectional, involves a distinct combination of signaling cascades in each partner, and has different molecular outcomes in each compartment. It is currently not clear how the two cell types can selectively respond to the TGF-\u03b2 produced by the other, but this phenomenon conceivably might reflect differences in TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, and/or structure of the latent complexes made by each cell type, as well as cell specific regulation of signal flux through the TGF-\u03b2 network within each cell type. However, since MMP-9 can create a microenvironment more favorable to invasion and metastasis through activation of growth factors, specifically TGF-\u03b2, and destruction of extracellular matrix, the combined biological outcome of the differing effects of TGF-\u03b2 on each compartment is likely to be a further enhancement of malignant behavior (Fig. 7).Transient Tumor-Fibroblast Interactions Generate Small Magnitude Molecular Effects That Induce Major Changes in OutcomeExposure of rat mammary tumor cells to exogenous TGF-\u03b2 ex vivo has previously been shown to promote metastatic efficiency in vivo . Here we have shown that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts, such as might occur when tumor cells traverse the surrounding tissue, can have a similar effect. The amount of active TGF-\u03b2 that was produced by the coculture was very low, and the activation of downstream signaling pathways was similarly mild (Figs 2 to   5). Nevertheless, these small magnitude, endogenous molecular effects altered the phenotype of the tumor cell such that it showed significantly increased malignant behavior even when no longer in contact with the fibroblast compartment. The data imply that carcinoma cells that have breached the basement membrane and are migrating through underlying connective tissue may be able to subvert and use resident, TGF-\u03b2 secreting fibroblasts to boost their motility and subsequent metastatic spread.Underlying MechanismsTGF-\u03b2 has a number of tumor cell-targeted effects that could contribute to the enhanced malignancy, including enhancement of tumor cell migration and invasion, direct effects on tumor cell survival, and changes in the composition of secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix components. The stimulatory effect of CoCM on primary tumor growth may reflect pro-survival effects of TGF-\u03b2 on CA1a cells as TGF-\u03b2 reduces apoptosis of CA1a cells (Fig. S1B), possibly acting in concert with other as yet unidentified trophic factors in the CM.The ability of TGF-\u03b2 to promote migration and invasion of CA1a cells may contribute to the enhanced metastasis, but additional mechanisms such as altered expression levels of junctional proteins like E-cadherin, integrins, or chemokines and chemokine receptors are also likely to play a role. For example, the organ tropism of metastatic tumors is determined in part by the spectrum of chemokines and chemokine receptors that they express, and TGF-\u03b2s have been shown to modulate relevant chemokine ligand/receptor axes in other models. TGF-\u03b2 derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts upregulates CXCR4 in initiated prostatic epithelial cells, and expression of CXCR4 correlates with lymph node metastasis in multiple human tumors. It will be the aim of future work to determine which mechanism is relevant for the expanded metastatic range shown by the CA1a breast cancer cells stimulated with fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2.Consequences and ConclusionsIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that a relatively short-lived interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts induces changes in the localized extracellular microenvironment that then substantially increase the malignancy of the tumor cells even after the original interaction has ceased. The data imply that normal resident fibroblasts that are exposed to direct contact with invading tumor cells may boost the motility and subsequent metastatic spread of these carcinoma cells. TGF-\u03b2 appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-\u03b2 pathway.Materials and MethodsCell Culture and Generation of Conditioned MediaMCF10CA1a (\u201cCA1a\u201d) is a malignant, metastatic human breast cancer line. Mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) were derived from newborn mice as previously described. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from embryos (ED 12 to ED 14) by suspending embryonic tissue in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (\u201cfibroblast medium\u201d). CA1a and DF were respectively grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (\u201cCA1a medium\u201d) and DMEM, low glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen or Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). To obtain conditioned media from homotypic cultures or cocultures, 1.5\u00d7106 cells of each type were plated in a 150 cm2 dish and incubated in a 1\u22361 mixture of CA1a- and fibroblast medium (\u201ccoculture medium\u201d). Culture supernatants were collected after 4 d and cells were removed by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min). Acellular supernatants were diluted with fresh coculture medium (conditioned medium, CM) and used for further experiments.Cell Scattering and MigrationDot AssayTo assess cell scattering, 20 \u00b5l of cell suspension (3\u00d7106 CA1a cells/ml) were placed in each well of 6-well plates and allowed to adhere to form tight well-circumscribed colonies. After 3 hours non-attached cells were removed by rinsing the plate with calcium-containing Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were incubated in regular culture medium overnight, and then switched for 4 days to a 1\u22361 mixture of CM and fresh coculture medium. Cell scattering was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically following staining with hematoxylin-eosin. Unconditioned medium served as an additional negative control. The effect of growth factors and cytokines on cell scattering was assessed by adding the following growth factors in concentrations as indicated to the culture medium for 4 days: human TGF-\u03b21, human EGF, LAP (all R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), human TNF-\u03b1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and HGF (kind gift from Don Bottaro). Where indicated, small molecule inhibitors of various signaling pathways (ALK4,5,7: SB431542, 5 \u00b5M, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; MEK/Erk: PD98059, 25 \u00b5M; p38: SB203580, 10 \u00b5M; JNK: SP600125, 10 \u00b5M (all Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)) were added to cultures 30 min before stimulation with the conditioned medium. Equal amounts of DMSO served as a negative control.Scratch AssayCA1a cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to confluence. Cell proliferation was blocked by a 30 min pretreatment with mitomycin C (25 \u00b5g/ml). A scratch was then made in each well using a 100 \u00b5l pipette tip and cells were stimulated with the various CM in 1\u22361 mixtures with fresh coculture medium. The scratch width at different time points was imaged and measured using ImagePro. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 2.0.Immunostaining and Western BlottingImmunofluorescence and Western Blotting were performed following established protocols. The following antibodies were used: Immunofluorescence: phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, phospho-ATF2, phospho-MAPKAPK2 (all 1\u2236100, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and E-cadherin (1\u2236800, Zymed, Carlsbad, CA). Western Blotting: Smad3 (1\u22361000, Zymed), Smad2/3 (1\u22361000, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), phospho-Smad3 (1\u223612 000, Gift from E. Leoff), phospho-Smad2, phospho-TAK, TAK (both 1\u22361000, Cell Signaling), and actin (1\u223660 000, BD Biosciences) for Western Blotting. Immunoperoxidase staining for phospho-Smad2 (1\u2236500, Millipore, Temecula,CA) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections.Transfection, Reporter Assays, and Lentiviral InfectionTransfection of CA1a cells with the CAGA12-luciferase plasmid or with the reporter plasmids ARE-luciferase/FAST-1, and lentiviral infections were performed as described previously.Quantification of TGF-\u03b2Levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in CM were determined using PAI-driven luciferase expression in CCL-64 cells. Briefly, CCL-64 cells that were stably transfected with PAI-luc were cultured in 48-well plates (20000 cells/well) in 200 \u00b5l RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS for 36 hours and serum starved (RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS) for 8 hours. Then 100 \u00b5l medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul CM (sample) or 100 \u00b5l unconditioned medium spiked with varying concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 to establish a standard curve. Cells were incubated over night, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vivo TumorigenesisFemale SCID and NOD SCID animals (age: 8\u201310 weeks) were purchased from the NCI Animal Production Program. For tumorigenesis studies, 4\u00d7104 tumor cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the # II and # VII mammary fat pads of female SCID mice. Tumor size was assessed using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula for an oblique spheroid (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail vein injection assays were performed by injecting 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS into the tail vein of female NOD SCID animals. Mice were euthanized after 8 weeks or when animals became moribund and examined grossly on necropsy for the presence of metastases in multiple organs. Metastasis was confirmed histologically.Orthotopic syngeneic mammary tumors of mouse breast cancer cells (4T1) in BALB/c mice and C3(1)TAg tumors were grown as previously described.Statistical AnalysisCumulative tumor volumes and survival graphs were analyzed by ANOVA (post hoc test Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Analysis), Kruskal-Wallis test (post hoc test Dunn's Multiple Comparison Analysis), Chi Square test, and Kaplan-Maier assays using Graph Pad Prism 5.0b. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM).Supporting InformationCompeting Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.Funding: This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, USA.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0028. (C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

(B) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with exosomes compared with NT. Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008).

Standard deviations were calculated with replicates from two independent experiments performed on four different primary NF cells (pt. #1, #2, #3, and #4) and four different primary CAF cells (pt. #81, #82, #87, and #89). The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes.

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0049. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy).

Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "The highly tumorigenic human breast cancer MCF-7ras line (Ha-ras-transfected MCF-7 cell line) loses estrogen dependence and secretes diffusible growth factors that support its own tumor growth in vivo. Our previous studies showed that carboxymethyl benzylamide dextran (CMDB7) inhibits the growth of breast MCF-7 and MCF-7ras cell lines. In this study, we have shown that conditioned medium (CM) from MCF-7 and MCF-7ras cells stimulated the DNA synthesis of BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts and that CMDB7 strongly inhibited these mitogenic effects in a dose-dependent manner. Neutralizing antibodies against platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) partially inhibited the mitogenic effect of MCF-7ras CM. The flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle showed that the CM of tumor cells increased the percentage of fibroblasts in S phase and that CMDB7 blocked them in G0/G1 phase. CMDB7 inhibited the mitogenic effect of PDGF-BB and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 but not those of epidermal growth factors and insulin-like growth factor on BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts. CMDB7 increased the electrophoretic mobility of radiolabeled PDGF-BB and TGF-beta1, apparently by forming a stable complex with these factors. On intact BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts, binding of iodinated growth factors (125I-TGF-beta1 and 125I-PDGF) to their receptors was completely displaced by CMDB7. In vivo studies demonstrated that s.c. injection of CMDB7 inhibited by 66% the tumor growth of MCF-7ras xenografts in nude mice. These results showed that CMDB7 inhibits the mitogenic effect of growth factors released from MCF-7 and MCF-7ras cells and suppresses tumor growth in the MCF-7ras model.",

        "full_text": "\u201cI was afraid they will be judging me and even deny me the service\u201d: Experiences of denial and dissuasion during abortion care in EthiopiaIntroductionDisrespect and abuse are components of poor quality abortion care. This analysis aimed to understand negative experiences of care from perspectives of abortion clients in public and private facilities in Ethiopia.Study DesignWe conducted 23 in-depth interviews with people who obtained abortion care in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia as well as Aksum and Mekele in Tigray State, Ethiopia. The interviews were coded using a priori and emergent codes and we conducted thematic analysis to understand negative interactions with providers from participant's perspectives.ResultsParticipants experienced denial of abortion services along their pathway to care and attempts by providers to dissuade them prior to providing an abortion. Underlying both the denial and the dissuasion were reports of disrespect and condemnation from providers. Participants described how providers doubted or forced them to justify their reasons for having an abortion, stigmatized them for seeking multiple abortions or later abortions, and ascribed misinformation about abortion safety. Despite reports of denial, dissuasion, and disrespect, abortion clients generally felt that providers had their best interest at heart and were grateful for having access to an abortion.ConclusionsParticipants in Ethiopia experienced providers as gatekeepers to legal abortion services, facing disrespect and judgment at facilities where they sought care. Interventions aimed at increasing awareness of abortion laws such that clients understand their rights and values clarification interventions for providers could help reduce barriers to accessing care and improve the quality of abortion services.IntroductionDecriminalizing and liberalizing abortion is an important step towards improving the availability of safe services, however, changes in abortion law do not ensure access to high-quality services. Even in contexts where abortion is legal, people are denied services and face a myriad of challenges in accessing high-quality care. People may face poor quality care along their pathways to care or during their abortions, including negative, stigmatizing, and discriminatory interactions with providers. Denial of services and poor interpersonal care from providers may have negative effects on the health outcomes and emotional well-being of those who seek abortion care.Denial of safe abortion care can lead to long, winding trajectories to care, emotional distress for abortion seekers, and unsafe abortion practices which are a significant contributor to maternal mortality. Denying an abortion may also have long-term implications including negative socioeconomic repercussions for families and negative developmental effects on existing children. Previous studies have documented some of the reasons for denial of services including: clients' lack of knowledge of legal availability of services, seeking care later in pregnancy, providers\u2019 perception that abortion had negative health implications, logistical challenges including long wait times and insufficient funds, and abortion stigma. Gender inequity and systemic oppression of women, and other people capable of pregnancy1 may leave them vulnerable as patients in medical settings with little choice but to acquiesce to the power of providers. Implementation and interpretation of abortion laws vary greatly and access to abortion services often depends on the personal beliefs of providers. Confusion and uncertainty surrounding abortion laws make health providers powerful gatekeepers to abortion services which contributes to denial of services and impacts the quality of care provided.It is well documented that obstetric violence, including disrespectful and abusive care, from providers is relatively commonplace in experiences of institutional birth. While disrespect and abuse during abortion care is less documented, studies have highlighted the importance of interpersonal aspects of care as well as the failure to provide person-centered care in many contexts. Providing person-centered care is an important aspect of a high-quality abortion. A person-centered abortion takes into consideration an individual's preferences, their culture, and the context around them, and it includes dignity, autonomy, privacy, communication, social support, and trust. One study assessing abortion-related obstetric violence in Latin America reported that providers criminalized, discriminated against, and were even physically violent with clients. Understanding service denial and disrespect from the perspective of people having abortions is important to improve person-centered care and develop interventions that can increase access to high-quality abortion services. This analysis aims to understand negative experiences of care from perspectives of abortion clients in Ethiopia.Ethiopia contextIn Ethiopia, legal access to abortion was expanded in 2005 to include cases of rape, incest, and fetal impairment, if the pregnant person had a physical or mental disability, or if they were under 18 years of age. Abortion in such cases is legally permitted up to 28 weeks gestation. An additional clause in the law stated that the pregnant person's word was sufficient evidence of rape or incest, and that \u201cstated age\u201d was all that was needed to authorize an age-based abortion. In theory, this would have shifted power into the hands of abortion seekers and away from providers in determining eligibility for services. However, despite this expansion of rights in the country, abortion remains in the criminal code and is punishable by imprisonment, creating confusion and ambiguity around the law for providers and patients alike. Additionally, abortion service organizations have largely avoided sharing information on legal abortion in order to avoid politicizing their work and provoking anti-abortion sentiment, which has resulted in limited advocacy and access to information on safe abortion options. The most recent data available on abortions rates in Ethiopia are from 2014, that year it was estimated that 13% of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion or an estimated 620,300 abortions. The majority of these abortions were provided by private or NGO facilities, however, a large number of public health facilities and public hospitals also provided care and many more are capable of providing abortion and post-abortion care services. This analysis offers a deeper understanding of abortion experiences in private and public health facilities in Ethiopia with a focus on exploring negative client-provider interactions that may be impacting the quality of abortion services.MethodsIn this study, we analyzed semi-structured in-depth interviews with people who obtained an abortion in either Addis Ababa or Aksum and Mek'ele in Tigray State (referred to as Tigray going forward), Ethiopia. These interviews were part of a larger study conducted in four countries with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of people's experiences with abortion services and their perceptions of quality of care. For the purpose of this manuscript, we conducted a sub-analysis of interviews in Ethiopia with the aim of understanding negative experiences of abortion care from client's perspectives.Three authors of this paper (SB, CB & AMR) collaborated with EG, an experienced qualitative researcher and a faculty member at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), school of public health to hire a local research team. EG served as the Study Coordinator and conducted interviews in Addis Ababa along with another trained qualitative researcher. Two additional qualitative researchers based at the University of Mekele were contracted to conduct data collection in Tigray region to ensure both linguistic and cultural considerations were taken into account for participants in that region. Two authors of this paper (CB & AMR) conducted trainings on ethical research, recruitment and qualitative interviewing techniques with the research team in-person in November 2018 and EG conducted a refresher training with data collectors in Tigray region in January 2019.Participants were recruited through both private clinics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia as well as public health facilities in Tigray. Participants who had obtained their abortions at private reproductive health clinics in Addis Ababa were recruited through a call center which provided clients with a referral to an affiliated clinic. The Call Center Coordinator called participants after they had completed their abortion to enquire on their interest in participating in this study. If they were interested in participating, their contact information was provided to EG to schedule a time to meet for an in-person interview. In Addis Ababa, participants chose a time and location for the interview that was convenient to them. The two local researchers in Tigray recruited participants at public health facilities with support from health facility staff. Health facility staff would approach potential participants prior to their abortion to enquire about their interest in participating. If they were interested, one of the local researchers would arrive at the health facility immediately after the client had received care to enroll them in the study. People were eligible to participate if they were 15 years or older, able to provide informed consent, able to speak Amharic or Tigrinya, and had had an abortion within 6 months prior to recruitment.The interview guide was developed as a part of the larger aforementioned study and was based on quality of care and person-centered care frameworks as well as prior studies on abortion quality with the goal of understanding people's experiences of and priorities in abortion care. The interview guide included questions on participants understanding of the local legal context and on understanding client-provider interactions. While the interview guide was similar across the four contexts, the local research team in Ethiopia helped edit the guide to ensure clarity and cultural applicability. The interviewers were fluent in either Amharic or Tigrinya and the interview guide was translated from English and reviewed for accuracy.All participants gave verbal consent to participate and to be audio-recorded prior to the start of the interview. All interviews took place in a private location and lasted between 40 and 60\u2005min. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated to English for analysis. EG conducted quality assurance checks on the transcripts to ensure accurate translation. Participants were compensated for their time and travel expenses which equated to approximately $5 USD. This study was approved by Allendale Investigational Review Board (IRB) based in the United States (Protocol Number: ASQ092018), MSI Reproductive Choices' Ethics Review Committee (Protocol Number: 023-18), and the IRB of St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College in Addis Ababa (Reference Number: PM23/56).An initial codebook was developed for the larger study, using themes from the interview guide, and was amended to include emergent themes. This codebook was applied to the interviews with Ethiopian abortion clients by CB and AK, who initially double coded two transcripts to ensure intercoder reliability. Coding was conducted with MAXQDA 2018 (VERBI Software, 2019). We conducted thematic analysis grouping together codes related to client-provider interactions. During this process, themes of denial and dissuasion arose and resulted in closer examination of negative interactions from participant's perspectives. We drafted additional analysis memos and created matrices of participant experiences with denial, disrespect, and dissuasion, as well as their understanding of the abortion law. As a form of data validation, EG reviewed the analysis and interpretation of the findings presented in this manuscript.

The participants ranged in age from 19 to 38 years, with an average age of 24 years. Nearly half of participants had children (n\u2009=\u200911, 47.8%) and the majority of participants also reported being unmarried (n\u2009=\u200915, 65.2%). The vast majority of participants (n\u2009=\u200920, 87%) had a medication abortion at a health facility; only 3 participants (13%) had Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) abortions. About two thirds of participants were in their first trimester (n\u2009=\u200916, 69.9%), while one third of participants were in their second trimester (n\u2009=\u20097, 30.4%). Four participants (17.4%) reported having had a prior abortion (See Table 1).Participant characteristics.\tN\u2009=\u200923\t \tn (%)\t \tAge (years)\t \t\u2003Mean\t24\t \t\u2003Range\t19\u201338\t \tHad children\t \t\u2003Yes\t11 (47.8%)\t \t\u2003No\t12 (52.2%)\t \tMarital Status\t \t\u2003Married\t7 (30.4%)\t \t\u2003Unmarried\t15 (65.2%)\t \t\u2003Divorced\t1 (4.3%)\t \tAbortion method\t \t\u2003Medication abortion\t20 (87%)\t \t\u2003Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA)\t3 (13%)\t \tGestational age\t \t\u2003\u226412 weeks\t16 (69.6%)\t \t\u2003>12 weeks\t7 (30.4%)\t \tPrior abortion\t \t\u2003Yes\t4 (17.4%)\t \t\u2003No\t19 (82.6%)\t \tFear of being denied abortion servicesFear of being denied abortion services arose prominently as a theme, with participants frequently reporting that they experienced concerns about denial prior to and during abortion care for a variety of reasons. The fear of denial was compounded by participants' personal circumstances, for example, this participant who had a prior abortion was worried about stigma and denial, \u201cI was afraid they will ask me why I let this happen for the second time. I was afraid they will be judging me and even deny me the service because it is my second time\u201d (Marta, Private Facility). Similarly, a participant who had their abortion later in pregnancy was worried about how the providers would respond, \u201cI had fear and I thought that the health care providers may not allow me to abort it. Maybe they would ask me why I didn\u2019t come sooner since the pregnancy was 5 months\u201d (Shewit, Public Facility). Participants who were seeking an abortion based on legally permissible reasons also worried whether providers would deny them an abortion. Several participants who had been raped or victims of incest were afraid that providers would not believe them or would not provide them the services, Letay, who was raped, explains, \u201cWhen I came to the hospital, I was very worried\u2009\u2026\u2009I was worried because it happened out of my marriage. And I was worried whether the health professionals will help me or not and if I would get the service or not\u201d (Letay, Public Facility).Participants' fear of denial may have been influenced by their lack of knowledge of their legal right to access abortion services. Participants' knowledge of abortion law in Ethiopia varied greatly with less than half of participants reporting any knowledge of the legal clauses. While some participants named numerous clauses under which they presumed abortion was legal, their knowledge was fragmented and often did not include the full scope of legally permissible reasons. Among those that knew there were legal clauses for abortion, most only mentioned rape and incest and no other clauses. Many participants believed that providers determined whether an abortion could be performed, \u201cIt's the doctor's decision\u201d (Frewoyni, Public Facility). Another participant explained in more detail, \u201cIf we are eligible, they tell us\u2026What I know is the healthcare provider can\u2019t do an abortion for everyone. They work based on documents or rules. They ask why we came and if the reason is acceptable, they give us the service.\u201d (Birhan, Public Facility) Birhan recognized that there were some regulations around abortion services and identified the provider as the gatekeeper. At the same time, another participant described the advice they received from a friend, \u201cI was stressed so I asked [a friend] about the health care providers, whether they are strict and what they will say if I go there seeking abortion, then she told me to say I got raped and I can\u2019t raise it if the baby is born, after that the health care providers will not say anything other than providing you the service.\u201d (Birkti, Public Facility) While the interaction that the participant describes acknowledges the power providers hold, it also demonstrates people's ingenuity in sharing information amongst themselves to subvert the power of gatekeepers and reduce their chances of being denied an abortion.Experiences of disrespect: denial and dissuasionDenial along pathways to careWhile all participants eventually succeeded in having an abortion, along their pathways to accessing care nearly half of participants experienced being denied services, sometimes at multiple points of care. Clients experienced denial of services for a variety of reasons including lack of financial resources, providers simply not wanting to provide the service, providers not believing their reason for seeking abortion, having had a prior abortion, seeking care later in pregnancy, moral judgement from providers and providers' perception of negative health implications related to an abortion. Many of these reasons aligned with the fears that participants shared about denial. One participant explained that they visited a facility multiple times, which was common among participants, \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough money then I told them I didn\u2019t have money the girl at the reception told me she can\u2019t do anything, I went back, to get money and come back [\u2026] and then I went back there after one month, I told them, \u201cthis thing happened, I didn\u2019t have money at the time\u201d and they were mean to me [\u2026] I came with money, was going there for a second time and they thought I didn\u2019t have money this time too but I had more than enough money.\u201d (Hawi, Private Facility) Being turned away from a facility, or multiple facilities, during the pathway to abortion care meant that participants could face judgement and condemnation from staff and providers at multiple points. The following participant notes the stigma they had to overcome to find a provider who was willing to provide an abortion, \u201cWhen I came here they did not give me the service\u2009\u2026They said they will not provide me the service, advised me not to abort, and sent me home. They told me I am killing a human being for the wrong reason, saying this is going to pass and I will be ok\u2009\u2026\u2009but I didn\u2019t listen and went to another facility to get the care. I was disappointed and frustrated. Then I went to private institution where they agreed to give me the service.\u201d (Birhan, Public Facility) Many other participants also recounted experiences of providers serving as the moral arbiters of their abortions, pressuring people not to terminate their pregnancies. Other participants were denied care because of providers' erroneous perception of abortion being dangerous. For example, Selam was denied services and was told that having an abortion might end their life, \u201cThe doctors told me when I went to the health centers to consult. They say they don't have the service in their facility. They told me wherever I go the abortion will be done using an instrument and I may even end up dead during the procedure or I may come out alive. The doctor told me the death is because of severe bleeding. He told me even if I go to a private clinic, I may end up dead. Finally, I decided to have the abortion even if I risk death. I preferred it rather than telling my family.\u201d (Selam, Private Facility) Participants faced misinformation and judgement from providers in their continued efforts to dissuade participants from having an abortion. However, even in the face of denial of care and fearmongering, participants persevered overcoming their fear of death to find the care they needed.Dissuasion at the point of abortion careEven after participants reached the facility where they would ultimately obtain care, they frequently reported providers attempting to dissuade them from having an abortion. Reflecting both the fears they had expressed and experiences of denial along their pathways to care, participants faced providers who required them to justify their decision to have an abortion, who showed disbelief in their personal circumstances, who attempted to convince them to keep the pregnancy, who spread misinformation about the safety of the procedure, and who morally disagreed with their decision. One participant shared how they felt the provider did not believe their reason for seeking an abortion, \u201cI asked about the service and told the health care provider I wanted to terminate the pregnancy because I was raped. However, the healthcare providers didn\u2019t trust me. They said that I was not raped, but was pregnant from my boyfriend, and told me to go and try to convince him [to keep the child] but I told them that it's not from my boyfriend. Then they understood and gave me the service.\u201d (Abrehet, Public Facility) After Abrehet was able to obtain an abortion, this participant reflected on their initial interaction stating, \u201cI understand that all they said was for my sake and I felt happy for that,\u201d reflecting discordance between the recount of their experience of treatment and how they perceived this treatment. Similarly, many clients shared experiences of providers interrogating them and requesting that they justify their decision to have an abortion, \u201cYou also have to go through so many investigations\u2026They were repeatedly asking why I was getting an abortion in the doctor's room\u201d (Adiam, Public Facility). Adiam also shared discordance when reflecting on their experience of care, they stated that they never felt judged and had \u201cno negative interactions\u201d with any of the providers or staff.Clients reported that after interrogating them for their decisions, providers then attempted to persuade them to keep the pregnancy. Frewoyni describes the provider's attempt to convince them to keep the pregnancy, \u201cHe also asked me, \u201cWhy are you aborting it?\u201d and I said, \u201cBecause I am poor, I can\u2019t raise the kid.\u201d Then he said, \u201cIt's better if you keep it and did your best to raise him.\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I? I can\u2019t!\u201d and he said, \u201cIf you want to abort it, you will sign for it.\u201d\u201d (Frewoyni, Public Facility) Frewoyni's provider also seemed to invoke a vague threat that Frewoyni would have to assume legal responsibility for their actions in his demand that they sign for their abortion. Participants also described how the providers or clinic staff attempted to dissuade them from obtaining an abortion by linking abortion to negative health outcomes, instilling fear in them and spreading misinformation. One participant explained how a provider made them fear for their life, \u201cI was in a dilemma. I was thinking of getting the abortion but I was scared for my health and my life\u2026When the health center health provider told me aborting a 5-month pregnancy could be dangerous for me, I was scared for my life.\u201d (Genet, Public Facility) Rather than reassure Genet of the safety of the procedure, the provider seemingly used fear as a tactic to dissuade them from having an abortion. Participants also spoke about providers who questioned their decisions on moral grounds, \u201cI talked to the doctor. He was trying to convince me not to terminate the pregnancy. He told me that abortion is not good. However, after I told him that I am not ready and don\u2019t want it, he accepted my decision.\u201d (Seada, Private Facility) As Seada describes, clients reported that providers tested their rationale and their necessity for an abortion before conceding and providing the service. Despite facing disrespect from providers, participants commonly felt that the clinic staff and providers were acting in their best interest, \u201cThis is out of concern. They think maybe we will listen to them that way.\u201d Semira classified the condemnation received during their abortion as a positive aspect of care, \u201cThis shows you the service is good. If they do not condemn you, I may not feel good at all. My provider was an older man. When he condemned me, I felt like my father was speaking to me.\u201d (Semira, Private Facility) Semira highlights a trend present amongst several participants who either felt that providers were expressing care in their condemnation or who felt they had received good service despite experiencing disrespect, denial, or dissuasion.DiscussionAcross 23 in-depth interviews with clients from public and private health facilities in two distinct geographic locations in Ethiopia, we found that many participants experienced denial of abortion services along their pathway to care and attempts by providers to dissuade them prior to providing an abortion. Underlying both the denial and the dissuasion were reports of disrespect and condemnation from providers. Participants described how providers doubted or forced them to justify their reasons for having an abortion, stigmatized them for seeking multiple abortions or later abortions, and ascribed misinformation about abortion safety. Despite reports of denial, dissuasion and disrespect, abortion clients generally felt that providers had their best interest at heart and were grateful for having access to an abortion.Participants faced providers who acted as gatekeepers to abortion services, denying and dissuading them even in cases where they explicitly gave legal reasons for seeking care. While these interviews were focused on clients' experiences of abortion, we know from research in Tunisia, Zambia and Zimbabwe that providers (whether pharmacists, front desk staff, or medical practitioners) often serve as gatekeepers to abortion access, navigating ambiguous or confusing laws and their own personal beliefs. Additionally, participants' limited knowledge of their legal right to abortion access may have meant that they were unable to advocate for themselves in situations where providers denied care or questioned their decision to have an abortion. This type of questioning can force people to relive traumatic events, such as rape or incest, by having to justify their reasons for wanting to have an abortion to providers. Eliminating client questioning would be a powerful step towards improving both person-centered care and overall quality of care. This study underlines the need for increased awareness of availability of abortion services within the legal limitations in Ethiopia, which could serve as a powerful tool for patient advocacy. Beyond increasing awareness, there are opportunities for context-specific provider and administrator trainings and support to increase access to abortion services. Interventions could focus on human rights based frameworks, stigma-reduction workshops, and elements of person-centered care including shared decision-making and trust.Abortion clients in this study reported examples of disrespect and abuse when they described being denied services they were legally eligible for, interrogation, explicit condemnation, and receiving erroneous information. Denial of care erodes trusting relationships with health systems and providers. Previous work has showed that trustworthy providers were a fundamental aspect of client-reported high-quality abortion care. Further, disrespect and abuse during maternal child care is rampant in patient-provider interactions, and abusive care, or obstetric violence, is now seen as a human-rights violation and a symptom of structural violence. A study in Ethiopia on disrespect and abuse during labor and delivery found that providers lacked training on respectful, responsive care, and on counseling. In addition to a lack of training on respectful client-provider interactions, providers denying and dissuading people from having an abortion might also be a greater symptom of social norms and abortion-related stigma in Ethiopia. Previous studies have shown the way that providers in Ethiopia describe the challenge of balancing their religious faith and values with their professional obligations to provide abortion. The internal conflict that some providers feel about providing abortion may perpetuate stigmatizing interactions with people seeking an abortion, and ultimately, may lead to poor quality of interpersonal care. In some cases people seeking abortions also share the same personal and religious beliefs about abortion as their providers and, as such, may believe that they deserve the disrespectful and abusive care that they are receiving.Among those that reported facing disrespectful care, participants still tended to describe their experiences and interactions as positive. This might be influenced by abortion stigma, fear, and expectations of care. The dissonance participants expressed between the type of treatment they received (judgement/negative) and their assessment of that same treatment (rationalization/positive) may be reflective of the same normative beliefs around abortion that influence provider's negative, judgmental treatment of abortion clients. It is common in abortion care broadly for people to report feeling satisfied with the services they receive and be grateful, regardless of the type of care, because they are no longer pregnant. This creates challenges for measuring quality of care of abortion services and, ultimately, for improving service delivery. A study in Ethiopia documenting women's satisfaction with facility-based maternal health care found similarly complex reflections on experiences of care with women largely reporting being satisfied if they had delivered a healthy child safely despite experiencing what might be considered abusive care. Our findings echo the complexities of basing quality of care measures on metrics like \u201csatisfaction\u201d and similarly highlight the importance of more nuanced client-centered indicators that take into consideration this type of discordance. In addition, monitoring and evaluation efforts at abortion facilities should take into account negative experiences of care in order to document their frequency and identify points of intervention.As with all research, this study had its limitations. While our objective was to understand experiences of abortion care from client's perspectives, we recognize that conducting interviews with providers would have added richness and a deeper level of understanding of client-provider interactions. Further research is needed to understand how abortion providers and clinic staff describe their care and the role they play in determining eligibility for abortion services in Ethiopia. Second, we did not structure our analysis to make comparisons between experiences of clients in private vs. public facilities in the country, nor did we structure our analysis to draw conclusions on the unique geographic and contextual differences that might have influenced participant's experiences of abortion care. Third, while the participants in this study described their personal experiences of denial and dissuasion, ultimately, they all received abortions. Their experiences may not be representative of others who were not able to receive abortion care. Finally, this study was completed prior to great civil unrest that has since broken out in Ethiopia and the findings cannot reflect how people's experiences accessing abortion have changed during this time. However, the lessons learned from this analysis could help improve legal access to abortion as the country heals from this internal conflict and seeks to rebuild access to health services \u2013 hopefully changing the way providers give abortion care and empowering people with knowledge of their rights so that everyone can have a high-quality abortion experience.ConclusionAlong the pathway to abortion care and during care, abortion clients in Ethiopia faced denial, dissuasion and disrespect from healthcare professionals contributing to the barriers they already face in accessing care and negatively impacting their experiences of care. Denial and dissuasion are both forms of disrespect that manifested in providers not believing clients, shaming them, and casting moral judgement on client's personal decisions and lives, and ultimately providers acting as gatekeepers to abortion services. Increasing awareness of abortion laws such that clients understand their rights and interventions aimed at addressing provider's beliefs and understanding of person-centered care could help reduce barriers to accessing care and improve the quality of abortion services. Furthermore, increasing efforts to understand and measure negative experiences of abortion care may help inform additional interventions to ultimately improve quality of care of abortion services for everyone.FundingSupport for this work came from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.

Fibroblasts within the tumor stroma, referred to as \u201ccancer-associated fibroblasts\u201d or CAFs, exhibit a cancer-associated phenotype and have been demonstrated to be major players in cancer progression. Mechanisms whereby CAFs promote tumor progression and metastasis include: 1) extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by upregulation of the proteoglycan syndecan I and alterations in collagen composition and 2) secretion of soluble growth factors or cytokines that support cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration. In addition, CAFs may facilitate metastasis by direct contact with cancer cells. The relationship between cancer cells and fibroblasts in tumorigenesis is, therefore, reciprocal.Here we have explored reciprocal signaling and physical interactions between breast cancer-derived tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) as well as between MDA-MB-231 cells and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) in a 3D Matrigel environment in which cancer cells, but not normal cells, aggregate. Aggregates then coalesce to form large aggregates with shapes reflective of their tumor of origin. We found that breast tumor cells release an activation factor(s) that causes changes in both dermal and mammary fibroblast shape and motility, and alterations in gene expression. Although the altered gene expression pattern differs between activated dermal and activated mammary fibroblasts, both types of activated fibroblasts markedly accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence relative to unconditioned fibroblasts. Interestingly, activated mammary fibroblasts are even more effective at inducing coalescence of MDA-MB-231than activated NHDFs.The activated fibroblasts, referred to here as cancer cell conditioned-normal human dermal fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) or cancer cell conditioned-human primary mammary fibroblasts (CC-HPMFs), are imbued with the capacity to invade the 3D Matrigel environment where they accelerate the rate of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence. We found that this acceleration is mediated by 1) soluble factors released by activated fibroblasts and 2) by the dynamic participation of CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, which function as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation. We further demonstrate that overexpressing podoplanin (PDPN), but not fibroblast activation protein (FAP), in NHDFs in the absence of the soluble activators from cancer cell-conditioned medium, activates fibroblasts, and imbues them with the capacity to accelerate cancer cell aggregation and coalescence.The functions described here for activated fibroblasts are distinct from the roles typically attributed to CAFs such as promotion of metastasis by basement membrane remodeling and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data support a model in which CAFs drive coalescence, and by so doing, may promote tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization.Material and methodsGrowth and maintenance of cell lines and primary cellsNormal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and Fibroblast Growth Medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (FGM), insulin (5\u03bcg/mL) and FGF-2 (1ng/mL) were obtained from PromoCell (http://www.promocell.com/) and cells were cultured as specified by the supplier. Human Primary Mammary Fibroblasts (HPMFs), HPMF growth media (HPMF-GM), the Fibroblast Medium Supplement Kit (FBS, hydrocortisone, L-glutamine, FGF and an antibiotic-anti-mycotic solution) and gelatin coating solution were obtained from Cell Biologics (http://www.cellbiologics.net). HPMF cells were cultured in HPMF-GM with the added supplements for 6\u20137 passages as specified by the supplier. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured for 12\u201315 passages in MCF media. MCF medium is DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% horse serum, human recombinant EGF, insulin, hydrocortisone and cholera toxin, all obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and penicillin-streptomycin from Thermo -Fisher (Grand Island, NY). GFP tagged human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs-GFP) were obtained from Angio-proteomie (www.angioproteomie.com) and cultured according to the supplier\u2019s directions.Activation of fibroblasts by MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium and assay preparationsTo generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblast growth media (CC-FGM), MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in 10 mL of FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum (Fig 1A1). The CC-FGM medium was then withdrawn from the culture flask and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to remove any detached MDA-MB-231cells or cell debris. To generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) (Fig 1B1), NHDFs were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in the filtered CC-FGM plus 30% fresh FGM. As a control, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency in FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum for 72 hours to generate fibroblast conditioned FGM (F-FGM) (Fig 1A2). The F-FGM was collected and filtered in the same manner as the CC-FGM. Next, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency for 72 hours in the filtered F-FGM to generate fibroblast cell conditioned fibroblasts (F-NHDFs) (Fig 1B2). Cancer cell conditioned HPMFs (CC-HPMFs) and fibroblast cell conditioned HPMFs (F-HPMFs) were generated using this same protocol with HPMF-GM. To determine if results were specific to one formula of media, reciprocal media controls were performed by culturing HPMFs in MCF media and CC-MCF media, again following the protocol illustrated in Fig 1. To determine if growth factors in the growth media were responsible for stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to condition the media, minimal conditioned media (CC- minimal MCF) was prepared by culturing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in MCF media without insulin or EGF and supplemented with 10% serum that had been charcoal stripped to remove growth factors (https://www.atlanta-biologicals.com). Finally, as an additional control, fibroblasts were grown in FGM or HPMF-GM that had not been conditioned by either MDA-MB-231 cells or by fibroblasts.The preparation used to analyze fibroblast cell motility and to compare the effects of F-NHDFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs on the aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.To prepare samples for 2D analysis of fibroblast motility, the 30 mm glass insert in a 60 mm Petri dish (https://www.cellvis.com/) was pre-coated with Type I human collagen (https://www.advancedbiomatrix.com) according to the supplier\u2019s instructions. Next, a 500 \u03bcl aliquot containing 5 x 104 NHDFs in FGM, F-NHDFs in F-FGM, CC-NHDFs in CC-FGM, HPMFs in HPMF-GM, F-HPMFs in F-HPMF-GM, or CC-HPMFs in CC-HPMF-GM was dispersed onto the collagen-coated insert. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1C) followed by addition of 5 ml of the appropriate media. To assay coalescence in 2D and 3D in the presence of fibroblasts, fibroblasts were first plated on the collagen-coated insert as described above. MDA-MB-231 cells were then harvested and 5x105 cells in 250 \u03bcl of medium were mixed with ice-cold Matrigel (Fig 1C) as described elsewhere in detail. Medium was removed from the collagen-coated insert and 750 \u03bcl of the cell/Matrigel mixture were gently applied over the fibroblasts (Fig 1D). The Matrigel was allowed to gel by incubating the dishes for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 and 5 ml of MCF media was then added. 2D and 3D images were acquired on a microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1E).2D analysis of fibroblast cell shape and motilityFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert of a Petri dish as described above. 2D images at 4x or 10x magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Illumination and acquisition were synchronized using Fire-I software (www.unibrain.com/products/fire-i-software/). A series of JPEG images were acquired every 45 seconds with a XCD-V50 camera (Sony, San Diego, CA). The images were imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and compiled into JDIAS movie format for motion and shape analysis. Cells were outlined at 7.5 minute intervals for 6 hours. Stacked perimeter plots were generated and length, width, perimeter, area and instantaneous velocity calculated as described previously. J3D-DIAS4.2 calculates persistence as the ratio of net to total path length at 5 frame intervals and averaged over the total path length.2D and 3D analysis of MDA-MB-231 aggregation and aggregate coalescence in the presence of NHDF, F-NHDF, F-HPMF, CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cellsNHDFs, F-NHDF, HPMFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs or CC-HPMFs were plated onto the collagen-coated insert and overlayed with a Matrigel/MDA-MB-231 cell suspension as described above. 2D images at 4X and 10X magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. For 3D analyses of coalescence with DIC optics, a lid with a glass insert was used to cover the dish. 3D cultures were imaged through a 20x objective using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) optics on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a motor-driven stage synchronized to a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 IEEE 1394 color CCD camera and an LED light source. The microscope was housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0in 5% CO2. A z-series of optical sections was acquired through the preparation at 10 \u03bcm increments and this process repeated every 10 minutes for up to 5 days. The z-series was imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and saved in movie format for 3D reconstructions, as previously described.ImmunostainingFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert (described above) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C in 5% CO2 before addition of 5 mL of media to the dish. After 24 hours, the preparation was rinsed with PBS and immunostained as described previously. Cells were stained with the anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (mAb) AMF-17b (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, (DSHB) http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) diluted 1:10 in PBS, or the rat anti-human podoplanin mAb NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS. The AMF-17b preparation was stained with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the NZ-1 preparation with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).qRT-PCRFor RNA preparations, conditioned and unconditioned fibroblast cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in RNAlater solution (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). The TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed to remove DNA. The quality of the RNA was confirmed with the Experion RNA StdSens and HighSens Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad) that assigned an RNA Quality Index (RQI) >9.5 for our samples, indicating little to no RNA degradation had occurred. To generate cDNA from the RNA samples, the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used, as recommended by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR assays were performed with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche) using 50 ng of the cDNA. The expression levels of the genes of interest were quantified using a Roche LightCycler480 real-time PCR detection system with SYBR green. The qRT-PCR assay for each of the tested genes was repeated three times, each in triplicate. The relative expression level of the genes was normalized to that of GAPDH. Primer pairs used for qRT-PCR are listed in S1 Table.Western blot analysis of cell lysates and mediaWestern analysis of protein from cell lysates was performed as previously described. Rat anti-podoplanin NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) and mouse anti-FAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC) were employed as primary antibodies. Mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin mAb E7 (DSHB; http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) was used as a loading control. To assess the release of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, media were concentrated with Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filter devices (Merck Millipore Ltd.) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol. Recombinant human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 (R&D Systems; https://www.rndsystems.com) was used as a positive control. Rabbit anti-human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect the cytokine. IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-rat, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used as secondary antibodies. Odyssey scanner and software were used for detection and quantification of immunoblots (Li-Cor Biosciences).Transwell assay with NHDF cellsA Corning Incorporated Transwell plate with 24 mm inserts, the latter constructed from 0.4 \u03bcm pore membranes (https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en.html), was used to test whether conditioned fibroblasts released a soluble factor capable of traversing the membrane to affect MDA-MB-231 cell behavior in the absence of fibroblast/cancer cell-cell contact. The plate well was first pre-coated with 100 \u03bcl of Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted to 1\u00d7106 cells per ml in MCF medium, chilled on ice, and a 500 \u03bcl aliquot mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold Matrigel. The chilled MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then inoculated into the pre-coated well. F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cultures, containing 4\u00d7104 cells, were suspended in 400 \u03bcl of F-FGM or CC-FGM medium, respectively, and spread on the insert filter over an empty well. The plate was then allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to allow for gelation of the Matrigel as well as attachment of the fibroblasts to the insert filter. Media were removed from the inserts and the inserts transferred on to wells containing the MDA-MB-231 cell/Matrigel mixture. The transwell preparation was incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow gelation of the Matrigel, followed by addition of 2.5 ml of MCF medium to each well. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. To confirm that fibroblasts could not migrate through the insert filter, the transwell assay was performed using NHDF cells in the absence of MDA-MB-231 cells and the bottom well examined microscopically.Development of NHDF overexpression strainsTo overexpress human PDPN and FAP genes transiently in NHDFs, we constructed plasmids pPDPN-C3 and pFAP-C3. To construct the overexpression plasmids, the PDPN and FAP genes were amplified by PCR from the plasmids containing human PDPN cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=443900) and human FAP cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=43440) with the primer pairs PDPN-1/-2 and FAP-1/-2, respectively. The PCR amplified coding regions of the genes were cloned under the control of CMV promoter in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 (BD Bioscienes Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) by enzyme restriction with AgeI and SalI and followed by ligation. To generate a control expression plasmid pmCherry-C3, the EGFP coding region in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 was swapped with the mCherry gene that was amplified from a plasmid with mCherry by PCR with primer pair mCherry-1/-2. Primer pairs used for generating the overexpression and control plasmids are listed in S1 Table. All sequences of the genes were verified after cloning. To generate PDPN and FAP overexpression strains, NHDF-PDPNoe and NHDF-FAPoe transfections of the plasmids into NHDF cells were performed using FuGENE transfection reagent (www.promega.com) according to the supplier\u2019s specifications and confirmed by positive expression of mCherry.Treatment of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN mAbmAb NZ-1, described above, was affinity purified using a Protein G HP spin trap column (GE Healthcare, Cat.#28903134) and concentrated using an ultra-centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Cat.# UFC905024). The concentration was measured by a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and 0.67 \u03bcg added to 4x104 F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs in 200 \u03bcl of medium. The preparations were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The contents of each tube were then divided equally between two collagen-coated wells. As controls, mAb in 200 \u03bcl PBS was processed similarly in the absence of cells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. An MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then cast over the fibroblast cell layer as described above. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope.MMP Gelatinase Zymography and treatment with MMP inhibitorSterile-filtered media were diluted 1:1 with zymogram sample buffer (BioRad) and 20 \u03bcl loaded into each well of a Tris-Glycine Novex 10% zymogram protein gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). SDS-Page gels were run at 118V constant voltage for 90 minutes. Gelatinase activity was detected following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Images of the gel demonstrating cleared regions of enzymatic activity were captured using a light box and Nikon CoolPix camera. Digital images were quantitated using ImageJ software. NHDFs were cultured in CC-FGM with or without 50 \u03bcM of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (http://www.emdmillipore.com) for 72 hours.Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12, anti- SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb and IL-6Recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and human/mouse SDF-1\u03b1 /CXCL12 mAb were obtained from R&D Systems (https://www.rndsystems.com) and reconstituted according to the supplier\u2019s specifications. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 24 hours in 10 ml of MCF media supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the reconstituted protein or supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the protein plus 25 \u03bcg of the anti-SDF-1\u03b1 mAb. To test the effect of IL-6 on MDA-MB-231s, cells were grown for 24 hours in MCF medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6, www.peprotech.co). To test the effect of rIL-6 on MDA-MB-231 cells, the rIL-6 treated MDA-MB-231 cells were embedded in 3D Matrigel as previously described. Images of 10 fields were taken at 24 hour intervals using a 4X objective.ResultsBreast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates NHDFs and alters gene expressionTo determine if treatment of fibroblasts with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells altered the shape and motility of the fibroblasts, NHDF cells were treated with cancer cell conditioned or fibroblast cell conditioned media as described in the Methods. A comparison of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, fixed on a collagen substrate and stained with the anti-vimentin mAb AMF-1b, revealed markedly different morphologies (Fig 2 A and 2B). F-NHDFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 2A), whereas CC-NHDFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 2B). On a collagen-coated 2D substrate, cellular translocation tracks of F-NHDFs were long and persistent, (Fig 2C), while tracks of CC-NHDFs were random and less persistent (Fig 2D). Morphometric measurements revealed that CC-NHDFs were on average significantly longer (Fig 2E), presumably due to the numerous elongated lamellipodia and filopodia, while F-NHDFs were significantly narrower (Fig 2F), and possessed on average a much smaller perimeter (Fig 2G) and a significantly smaller area (Fig 2H), than CC-NHDFs. Instantaneous velocity, computed without directional bias, was similar for CC-NHDFs and F-NHDFs (Fig 2I), but the computed persistence of translocation was significantly higher for F-NHDFs than CC-NHDFs (Fig 2J). These results indicate that factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells alter both the morphology and behavior of dermal fibroblasts.Medium conditioned by the breast tumor-derived cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs affecting polarity, cellular translocation, morphology and gene expression.A, B. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained for vimentin (green) to visualize cell shape, and with DAPI (blue) to visualize nuclei. C-D. Motility tracks at 7.5 minute intervals of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, generated by J3D-DIAS4.2 software that automatically detects cell perimeters and computes tracks. E- J. J3D-DIAS4.2 computations of length, width, perimeter, area, instantaneous velocity and the persistence of translocation. The means and error bar (standard deviations) are presented in all panels for an N = 50. ***** indicates significance of p<0.00005, *** indicates significance p<0.0005, N.S indicates not significant. K. qRT-PCR analyses of the transcript levels of ten genes associated with fibroblast activation. Means and error bars (standard deviations) are presented for N = 3. Asterisk (*) indicates significance of p <0.05. L,M. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1. Arrows denote punctate plasma membrane staining. N. Western blot of F-NHDF and CC-NHDF lysates probed with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1 and the anti-tubulin mAb E7.Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-NHDFs, expression of ten genes previously demonstrated to be involved in fibroblast activation and/or motility was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The genes included vimentin (VIM), PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (ACTA), the tyrosine kinase discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), desmin (DES), FAP, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB), Ca++ binding protein (FSP1/S100A4), and syndecan1 (SDC1). Five of the genes, PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB were up-regulated in CC-NHDFs by more than two-fold (Fig 2K). PDPN was upregulated nine-fold and FAP ten-fold (Fig 2K). F-NHDF cells did not stain with the anti-podoplanin mAb (Fig 2L), but CC-NHDF cells stained intensely (Fig 2M, arrows). Western blot analysis supported the fluorescence data, demonstrating that PDPN was expressed in CC-NHDFs, but not in F-NHDFs (Fig 2N). Western blot analyses of FAP revealed that it was present in F-NHDFs, and the level increased several fold in CC-NHDFs (S1A Fig). Therefore, factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells induce changes in NHDF gene expression consistent with fibroblast activation.CC-NHDF cells accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescenceIn the experimental protocol employed, in the absence of a fibroblast substratum, cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence (hereafter referred to as \u201caggregation and coalescence\u201d) occurred slowly over 192 hours. At 72 hours, cells had moved through the gel, forming small aggregates (Fig 3A, arrows). Aggregation and coalescence continued so that by 144 hours, the great majority of cells in the field resided in a few large aggregates, and the surrounding Matrigel was depleted of single cells as previously described. When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast over F-NHDFs, the rates of aggregation and coalescence were similar (Fig 3A, arrows). When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast in Matrigel over CC-NHDFs, aggregation and coalescence occurred at a dramatically accelerated rate, forming large aggregates by 72 hours (Fig 3A, arrows), at least four-fold greater than preparations cast over F-NHDF cells. Quantitative analysis of the size of aggregates in 10 different fields of duplicate 72 hour cultures confirmed these differences (Fig 3B). The median area of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates formed over CC-NHDFs was more than four-fold larger than those formed over F-NHDFs (Fig 3B).CC-NHDFs but not F-NHDFs accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.A. Representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase is cast over the substrate in the absence of fibroblasts, over F-NHDF cells on collagen and over CC-NHDF cells on collagen. Red arrows indicate MDA-MB-231 aggregates. B. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-NHDF cells (blue) or CC-NHDF cells (orange). The median area of each population is noted as a blue or orange arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-NHDF when compared to F-NHDFs.CC-NHDFs attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds in the 3D model2D imaging suggested that accelerated aggregation and coalescence was more pronounced in the Matrigel region closest to the CC-NHDF substratum. To explore this observation, we used the 3D reconstruction software J3D-DIAS4.2. In Fig 4A and 4B, side views of reconstructions are presented of a MDA-MB-231/Matrigel preparation cast over F-NHDF and CC-NHDF substrates. Fibroblasts are color-coded yellow and MDA-MB-231 cells and aggregates color-coded red. The MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates over the F-NHDF substratum remained dispersed throughout the 3D Matrigel matrix after 24 hours (Fig 4A), whereas MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates accumulated in the Matrigel region closest to the interface with the CC-NHDF substratum (Fig 4B, white arrows). The F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cells were distinguishable from the MDA-MB-231 cells over time by visually monitoring the optical sections collected every 10 minutes.CC-NHDF cells attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of cancer cells.A, B. Side views of 3D reconstructions of MDA-MB-231 cells (red) in Matrigel cast over NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen or CC-NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen, respectively, after 24 hours of incubation. Arrows point to MDA-MB-231 aggregates forming at or near the collagen/Matrigel interface and in physical contact with CC-NHDFs. C. 3D of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) over a 21 hour period, with both cell types tracked by analyzing the optical section stacks at 10 minute intervals. D. 3D reconstructions of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) between 50 and 60 hours of incubation. Reconstructions were performed with J3D-DIAS4.2 software.To further investigate the interactions between CC-NHDFs and MDA-MB-231 cells in the 3D Matrigel environment, we reconstructed single cells and clusters of cells using J3D-DIAS4.2. In the first reconstructions in Fig 4C, a CC-NHDF cell (yellow, 1), at the CC-NHDF-MDA-MB-231/Matrigel interface at 0 hours moved in a directed fashion (arrow) towards an MDA-MB-231 cell (red, 1) between 0 and 3 hours. At 5.5 hours, the CC-NHDF contacted MDA-MB-231 cell 1, changed direction, and migrated towards a developing aggregate, with MDA-MB-231 cell 1 in tow (Fig 4C). During that same time period, two additional MDA-MB-231 cells, (red 2 and 3), in contact with another CC-NHDF cell, moved in the direction of CC-NHDF cell 1, and by 21 hours, MDA-MB-231 cells 1, 2 and 3 had aggregated around several CC-NHDF cells, including CC-NHDF cell 1 (Fig 4C). In a second reconstruction in a later time period, shown in Fig 4D, MDA-MB-231 cells (red) aggregated using CC-NHDF cells (yellow), as scaffolds. These behaviors were observed in additional regions optically sectioned in a similar fashion in multiple preparations.CC-NHDFs penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlayIn examining optical sections, it also appeared that CC-NHDFs, but not F-NHDFs, penetrated the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay. To explore this observation, the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixtures were cast over NHDF-GFP cells treated with either fibroblast conditioned medium (\u201cF-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d) or MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium (\u201cCC-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d). DIC and fluorescent images were obtained at different distances through the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase after 72 hours of incubation. No F-NHDF-GFP cells were observed through 5 to 45 \u03bcm of the Matrigel phase (Fig 5A). However, CC-NHDF-GFP cells, were observed extending at least 30 \u03bcm into the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase (Fig 5B). After 96 hours, CC-NHDF-GFP cells (green) were enmeshed in the MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates within the Matrigel overlay (Fig 5C).CC-NHDFs act as scaffolds and penetrate MDA-MB-231 aggregates to support and facilitate aggregation.A. F-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer do not penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay after 72 hours of incubation. B. CC-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer penetrate through at least 30 \u03bcm of the MB-231/Matrigel upper phase after 72 hours of incubation. Fluorescent images were combined with phase contrast images at ascending depths through the upper phase. Cells or their projections are numbered. C. Optical sections of an aggregate at 96 hours of culture formed in the Matrigel phase of a preparation in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells were plated on the collagen substratum. The fluorescent images of the CC-NHDFs and the phase DIC images of all the cells are merged for each optical section.A quantitative analysis was performed to verify that CC-NHDF cells had a greater propensity to invade the Matrigel and incorporate into MDA-MB-231 aggregates than F-NHDF cells. An examination of 10 independent aggregates at 172 hours in preparations containing F-NHDF-GFP cells revealed F-NHDF-GFP cells in 23% of MDA-MB-231 aggregates. The average number of F-NHDF-GFP cells within the 23% of aggregates containing them was 3 \u00b1 1.8. The highest level in the 150 \u03bcm z-series at which F-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 33.6 \u03bcm \u00b1 14.3. In contrast, 100% of the 10 aggregates examined in the CC-NHDF-GFP preparations contained CC-NHDF-GFP with an average number of 54 \u00b1 15 CC-NHDF-GFP cells per aggregate (p<0.005). The average highest level in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 100 \u03bcm \u00b1 28.2 (p<0.0005).The role of PDPNBecause PDPN and FAP were upregulated at the transcript level more than nine-fold in CC-NHDFs, we assessed whether upregulation of either played a role in the acquisition of the capacity of CC-NHDFs to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells. To that end, we generated the PDPN and FAP overexpression strains NHDF-PDPN\u0153 and NHDF-FAP\u0153. We then tested whether overexpression of either resulted in activation of NHDF cells, thereby imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence in a 3D environment. After 24 hours, there was minimal aggregation of the MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a control NHDF substratum (Fig 6A). In marked contrast, after 24 hours, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a NHDF-PDPN\u0153 substratum was accelerated (Fig 6B). After 72 hours, while MDA-MB-231 cells over the NHDF cells had formed medium-sized aggregates (Fig 6C), the majority of MDA-MB-231 cells over NHDF-PDPN\u0153 cells had coalesced into large aggregates (Fig 6D). Overexpressing FAP in NHDF cells, however, did not imbue them with the capacity to accelerate (S1B Fig). To further explore the role of PDPN, we tested whether anti-podoplanin mAb NZ-1 affected acceleration. Compared to the coalescence on a substratum of CC-NHDF cells (Fig 6E), NZ-1 reduced the rate of aggregation and coalescence (Fig 6F), reinforcing the conclusion that PDPN plays a central role in the capacity of CC-NHDF cells to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D environment.Overexpression of podoplanin imbues NHDFs not activated with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium with the capacity to accelerate aggregation and coalescence, and pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-podoplanin mAb blocks its capacity to accelerate.A.

The inserts were overlaid with a suspension of either F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs and placed over the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase, the latter in the bottom wells (Fig 7A). The MDA-MB-231 cells that were separated from untreated F-NHDF cells underwent coalescence at a far slower rate than MDA-MB-231 cells separated from CC-NHDF cells (Fig 7B) and the aggregates were more spheroid than those formed on CC-NHDF scaffolds. Microscopic scanning revealed that no CC-NHDF cells or lamellipodia had traversed the micropore filter. The transwell experiment therefore demonstrated that, in addition to direct physical interaction, activated fibroblasts also stimulated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells by releasing soluble factors.CC-NHDFs release soluble signals that accelerate aggregation and coalescence.A.

Coalescence after 48 and 72 hours of untreated MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 plus anti-SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with rIL-6.One possible candidate for acceleration factors released by activated fibroblasts were the MMPs. The levels of pro-MMP9, MMP9, MMP2 and MMP1, assessed by zymography were 5.5, 5.9, 1.3 and 7.5 fold higher, respectively, in CC-FGM taken after 72 hours on CC-NHDF cells (lane CC-FGM/CC-NHDF) (Fig 7C) than in F-FGM taken after 72 hours on NHDF cells (lane F-FGM). A small amount of pro-MMP2 was present in all samples of FGM, but apart from that weak band, MDA-MB-231 cells did not release detectable levels of MMPs into the CC-FGM (lane CC-FGM/MB-231s) (Fig 7C). Thus, dermal fibroblasts secreted relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media. To confirm these data, we tested whether the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, blocked acceleration of coalescence using the CC-NHDF cells. After 24 hours of incubation, MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel overlaying a CC-NHDF substratum had begun to aggregate, but MDA-MB-231 cells overlaid onto CC-NHDF cultures that had been treated with GM6001 remained randomly dispersed (Fig 7D).The chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is also released by activated fibroblasts with reported effects on cancer cell locomotion and metastasis. Our Western blot analysis confirmed that CC-NHDFs released SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 into the media at levels several fold higher than F-NHDFs or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 7E). We therefore grew MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 hours in the presence of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and monitored their subsequent aggregation and coalescence in the 3D Matrigel environment. Accelerated MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence was noted after 48 hours and was quite evident after 72 hours (Fig 7F). Addition of the anti- SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb to the culture medium containing SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 abrogated the effect (Fig 7F). Finally, we tested whether aggregation and coalescence were directly stimulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by treatment with rIL-6. To that end, rIL-6 was added to the growth medium for 24 hours prior to suspending the treated cells in Matrigel for the coalescence assay. Images acquired following 48 hours in Matrigel showed no effect from rIL-6 treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells, nor was acceleration observed at 72 hours (Fig 7F).Breast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates HPMFs affecting their polarity, morphology, gene expression, ability to accelerate coalescence and MMP releaseIn order to confirm the results obtained with CC-NHDFs, we performed similar experiments with conditioned and unconditioned primary mammary fibroblasts. As was the case with the dermal fibroblasts, dramatic changes in morphologies were noted in CC-HPMFs on a collagen substrate. That is, while F-HPMFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 8A), similar to F-NHDF cells and consistent with the morphology of young, non-senescent fibroblasts, CC-HPMFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 8B). Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-HPMFs, we examined the expression of the same ten genes by qRT-PCR that we assessed in the dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, a different set of genes were upregulated in CC-HPMFs when compared to CC-NHDF cells. These included VIM, DES, FAP, PDFGRA and S100A4 while syndecan I (SDC1) was significantly downregulated (Fig 8 C). Nevertheless, when cast over CC-HPMFs, the rate of coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells far exceeded that observed with CC-NHDFs and was evident as early as 24 hours (Fig 8 D, arrows). In addition, destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer was even more pronounced (Fig 8E, dashed red line) and the area of aggregates appeared significantly greater (Fig 8F, solid red line), an observation that was confirmed by measuring aggregate areas (Fig 8G). To determine if CC-HPMFs, like CC-NHDFs, released elevated MMPs, pro-MMP9, MMP9, pro-MMP2, MMP2 and MMP1 were assessed by gel zymography (Fig 8G). Pro-MMP9 was not detectable in any of the HPMF-GM preparations while pro-MMP2 was present in all samples. MMP9 and MMP2 were only detectable in CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF while MMP1 was not detected in any of the media. Therefore, although dermal and mammary fibroblasts release different collagenase enzymes of the MMP family, both release relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media.CC-HPMFs exhibit altered morphology, altered gene expression, accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence and release elevated MMPs.A, B.

E. Substrate level, 10x magnification of representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen reveals advanced coalescence and considerably more destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer (dashed red line) in comparison to F-HPMF monolayer. F. Representative images of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells cast over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen at 72 hours at the 50 \u03bcm level demonstrate significantly larger aggregates over the CC-HPMF layer (solid red line) in comparison to the F-HPMF layer. G. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-HPMF cells (gray), and CC-HPMF cells (yellow). The median area of each population is noted as a gray or yellow arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-HPMFs when compared to F-HPMFs. H. Gel zymogram and quantitation of pixel intensities of MMPs in HPMF-GM directly from the bottle of sterile, unused media (no cells); F-HPMF-GM, media from 72 hour cultures of F-HPMFs; CC-HPMF-GM/MB-231, media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cultures; and CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF, media from 72 hour CC-HPMF cultures.To determine if components specific to the HPMF-GM were stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cells to secrete activating factors into the conditioned medium, we performed the coalescence assay with different varieties of media. First, in a reciprocal media experiment, we conditioned HPMFs with MCF media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 (CC-MCF). Second, we prepared a minimal MCF medium (CC-minimal MCF) by omitting growth factors and supplementing with serum that had been stripped of growth factors. We then conditioned HPMFs with CC- minimal MCF from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cells. As controls, we cultured HPMFs in unconditioned MCF and unconditioned minimal MCF. Again, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells were accelerated in the presence of conditioned HPMFs as compared to their unconditioned counterparts with obvious destruction of the fibroblast monolayer, similar to observations in CC-HPMF, with a slight delay at 24 hours in the CC- minimal MCF (S2 Fig). Therefore, secretion of fibroblast stimulatory factors by MDA-MB-231 cells is not media specific, although serum associated cytokines and growth factors, prevalent in the tumor microenvironment, likely enhance their ability to secrete these stimulatory factors.DiscussionBoth in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that CAFs and tumor cells interact to drive tumor progression, leading to several proposed models for reciprocal signaling. Given the significance of reciprocal signaling and the formation of tumors in a 3D environment, we have developed a 3D model to analyze not only signaling, but also physical interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells. We found that MDA-MB-231 cells release a fibroblast activation signal, and that these activated fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs) then accelerate breast cancer cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by, in turn, releasing soluble factors and also by serving as physical scaffolds for breast cancer cell aggregation (Fig 9). The soluble factors appear to include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and, in the case of CC-NHDFs, the chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12.A model showing how activation of fibroblasts leads to accelerated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a 3D Matrigel environment.A. Activation of NHDFs and HPMFs to CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, respectively, after exposure to a medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. B. Physical interactions between MDA-MB-231 cancer cells and CC-fibroblasts occur initially at the collagen 1/Matrigel interface but later throughout the 3D environment with CC-fibroblasts serving as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 cell coalescence. C. Release of soluble signals by CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cells accelerates coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.NHDF activationFibroblasts can be activated by a number of molecular signals, depending upon body location, developmental circumstances such as embryogenesis, tissue maintenance, wound healing and tumorigenesis. Here, we have demonstrated that medium conditioned by the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs and HPMFs, transforming them into CAFs with altered morphology, motility and gene expression, most notably, the capacity to accelerate breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.NHDF activation by MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium resulted in more than a two-fold increase in the expression of five of the ten tested genes, selected for their association with fibroblast activation. The five included PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB. Because PDPN and FAP were the most dramatically upregulated and also previously implicated in fibroblast activation, we tested whether overexpression of either imbued NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence. Overexpressing PDPN did imbue NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate, but overexpressing FAP did not. In addition, pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN antibody blocked their capacity to accelerate. These results indicate that PDPN plays a central role in NHDF activation.PDPN has been shown to regulate the Wnt/\u00df-cat signaling pathway, presumably through its interaction with ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins that link cytoskeletal structures to cell membranes. Because PDPN was undetectable in NHDF cells, we assume that the activating factor released by MDA-MB-231 cells does not function through interaction with PDPN, but rather another receptor, and that activation through the Wnt/\u00df-cat pathway results in PDPN upregulation.Suchanski et al (2017) found that PDPN overexpression in fibroblasts co-cultured with cancer cells did not enhance migration or invasion of cancer cells, but did increase the motility of fibroblasts, measured indirectly by the ability of activated fibroblasts to traverse a filter with an 8 \u03bcm pore size. Although we did not see increased velocity in our direct measurements of CC-NHDF cell motility in which PDPN was upregulated, our finding that activation causes shape changes and Matrigel invasion are consistent with their reported increased ability to penetrate a filter.Activation of HPMFs resulted in upregulation of FAP, VIM, DES, PDFGRA and S100A4, while, interestingly, SCDI was significantly downregulated. In contrast to our results, in a study by Liakou et al (2016), SCD1 was upregulated in HPMFs treated for 24 hours with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. However, we employed a different conditioning protocol and, perhaps more importantly, our conditioning period was considerably longer. Thus, the discrepancy in SCD1 expression may be attributable to fibroblast plasticity and the existence of transitional fibroblast states. The difference is quite likely due to time-dependent changes in gene expression, including transcription factor genes, in a program of differentiation. CAFs are remarkably heterogeneic and transitional states with overlapping gene expression patterns are common in the tumor stroma. The upregulation of VIM, DES, and FAP are features of myofibroblasts. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the longer conditioning period we employed may reflect a myofibroblast-like transitional state, and is consistent with the prevalence of stromal cells with myofibroblast characteristics in epithelial tumors.Acceleration by physical interactionsAlthough numerous studies have focused on diffusible, soluble factors released by CAFs, that promote cancer progression through EMT and the concomitant acquisition of cancer cell motility and metastasis, only a few have examined possible physical interactions between CAFs and cancer cells. Gaggioli et al (2007) showed that CAFs generated tracks in a Matrigel/collagen matrix into which overlying squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCCs) collectively migrated. When CAFs and SCCs were mixed, the leading cell was typically a fibroblast during collective migration of the SCCs. Pretreatment of the matrix with CAFs, followed by removal of CAFs and subsequent seeding of the SCC cells enabled SCC invasion, suggesting that during metastasis, CAFs generated tracks in the matrix that cancer cells subsequently entered. In a later study it was reported that when CAFs and SCCs were co-cultured as spheroids in a Matrigel/collagen matrix, SCC cells followed the CAFs as the cells exited the spheroids. Most relevant to the results presented here, Knuchel et al (2015) demonstrated that fibroblasts promote colorectal cancer (CRC) cell elongation and motility through direct cell-cell interactions, and that adhesion appears to be mediated by FGF-2, FGFR and integrin \u03b1v\u00df5. They also demonstrated that fibroblasts directed CRC cells to exit established CRC spheroids.Our experimental design allowed us to observe dynamic physical interactions between fibroblasts overlayed with cancer cells in a 3D environment in which each cell type was plated in its normal microenvironment; i.e. fibroblasts on collagen and cancer cells of epithelial origin in the basement membrane matrix Matrigel. Our 4D analysis of live cultures revealed that fibroblasts were able to penetrate the matrix, and by 48 hours, functioned as scaffolds for cancer cell aggregation. Movement of MDA-MB-231 cells was directional, towards and along the elongated CC-NHDFs in the process of aggregation. Aggregates enveloped the CC-NHDFs. CC-NHDF migration and scaffolding occurred as much as 70 \u03bcm above the original CC-NHDF/Matrigel boundary. In support of our findings, fibroblasts isolated from the interface zone between breast tumors and stroma actively modulated tumor cell behavior in co-cultures to a greater extent than normal fibroblasts or fibroblasts within the tumor. Importantly, the interactions revealed in our model might occur very early in in vivo tumorigenesis and may explain tumor growth and tumor heterogeneity in cases of field cancerization, a widely documented occurrence in many types of cancers, including breast cancer, in which discrete, multiple islands or foci of neoplastic cells are present within the diseased tissue. Based on an examination of 783 oral tumors, Slaughter suggested that these foci grow independently and eventually coalesce to form a tumor, a suggestion that has been more recently documented in histological analyses of melanoma development in humans.Acceleration of coalescence by soluble factors released by CC-NHDF cellsCC-NHDFs accelerated aggregation and coalescence across the filter in a transwell assay without penetrating the filter, demonstrating that the CC-NHDFs released one or more soluble acceleration factors. However, the aggregates induced by soluble factors alone were far more compact than the aggregates accelerated by CC-NHDF scaffolding. This suggests either that the mechanism of acceleration by soluble factors differs from that mediated by physical scaffolding, or that in the latter case, the CC-NHDFs caused larger but more diffuse aggregates because their presence interfered with compactness of MDA-MB-231 cells. To identify acceleration factors, we tested several molecules reported to be secreted by activated fibroblasts. First, we found that CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are released by activated fibroblasts and remodel ECM, at five to ten times the level of inactivated fibroblasts, and that the MMP inhibitor GM6001 retarded aggregation and coalescence. MMPs, by remodeling the ECM, may facilitate fibroblast and MDA-MB-231 translocation through the 3D matrix, thus accelerating the process of aggregation and coalescence. Secondly, we found that the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is released by CC-NHDFs and accelerates aggregation and coalescence. SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which has been demonstrated to affect cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, must directly affect MDA-MB-231 behavior, probably through the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 receptor, which has been shown to be expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells.ConclusionBased on the tumor cell-specific characteristics of cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment, we designed an assay to investigate bidirectional signaling and physical cell-cell interactions of fibroblasts and breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cells. We first demonstrated that tumor cells activated fibroblasts by releasing an unidentified factor. Activation appeared to involve up-regulation of podoplanin in dermal fibroblasts, which plays a major role in the effects these fibroblasts have on tumor cells. In turn, activated fibroblasts released one or more soluble signals, tentatively identified as matrix metalloproteinases and the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which accelerated the rate of tumor cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by four-fold. HPMF activation involved a different gene expression pattern but nevertheless, similar to CC-NHDFs, MMP secretion was markedly increased along with the rate and extent of coalescence in breast cancer cells. We further demonstrated that activated fibroblasts also accelerate aggregation and coalescence by traversing a 3D Matrigel environment and physically acting as scaffolds for cancer cells. We hypothesize that the reciprocal signaling system, in conjunction with the direct interaction of activated fibroblasts with cancer cells, as revealed in the 3D Matrigel environment and described here, may reflect interactions between breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts in vivo. These interactions may ultimately facilitate tumor growth and coalescence in early stages of tumorigenesis in field cancerized tissue and may also reflect cancer cell-fibroblast interactions that do not involve coalescence during tumor development.Supporting informationReferencesStromal contributions to the carcinogenic processThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerIonizing radiation-mediated premature senescence and paracrine interactions with cancer cells enhance the expression of syndecan 1 in human breast stromal fibroblasts: the role of TGF-betaSyndecan-1 in breast cancer stroma fibroblasts regulates extracellular matrix fiber organization and carcinoma cell motilityMatrix crosslinking forces tumor progression by enhancing integrin signalingMatrix metalloproteinases as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in human cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblast surface-associated FGF-2 promotes contact-dependent colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion through FGFR-SRC signaling and integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(5)-mediated adhesionFibroblast-led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cellsA mechanically active heterotypic E-cadherin/N-cadherin adhesion enables fibroblasts to drive cancer cell invasionReciprocal activation of prostate cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemnessA Computer-Assisted 3D Model for Analyzing the Aggregation of Tumorigenic Cells Reveals Specialized Behaviors and Unique Cell Types that Facilitate Aggregate CoalescenceMelanoma cells undergo aggressive coalescence in a 3D Matrigel model that is repressed by anti-CD44Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 promotes breast cancer metastasis by facilitating tumor cell intravasationThe hallmarks of CAFs in cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts induce metalloprotease-independent cancer cell invasion of the basement membraneCancer associated fibroblasts: An essential role in the tumor microenvironmentField cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium;

Immunohistochemical analysis of human breast cancer tissues showed localized, membranous PDGF receptor expression/activation in periepithelial stromal cell populations, suggesting a paracrine stimulation of adjacent stromal tissue by breast tumor cells. Moreover, a recent study of invasive ductal breast carcinomas demonstrated an association between PDGF receptor alpha (\u03b1-PDGFR) staining and lymph node metastasis. In experimental models of breast cancer, PDGF initiates a human breast carcinoma desmoplastic response via paracrine signaling. PDGF autocrine signaling was shown to be essential for tumor formation and metastasis in Ras-mediated mammary tumors as well as in MMTV-Neu/TGF-\u03b2 transgenic mice. Importantly, our recent tissue microarray analysis of 216 patients with invasive breast cancer showed that increased PDGF-C expression correlates with lymph node metastases, increased Ki-67 proliferation staining, and lower rates of 7-yr disease-free survival (Meng et al, manuscript under review). Furthermore, a role for PDGF-C in malignancy was suggested by the observation that Ewing sarcoma cell lines showed increased expression and secretion of PDGF-C. When a dominant negative PDGF-C construct was expressed in these cell lines, they showed a reduction of anchorage independent growth, but not a full reversion of the phenotype. PDGF-C autocrine signaling has also been suggested for the initiation and progression of brain tumors such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. However, little is known about the role of PDGF-C in breast cancer at the present.While the classical PDGF ligands A and B are secreted as active heterodimer or homodimers, newly identified PDGF ligands C and D are secreted as latent homodimers containing an N-terminal CUB domain and a C-terminal growth factor domain (GFD). Previous reports demonstrated that plasmin and a component of fetal bovine serum were capable of processing latent PDGF-C into the growth factor domain, and identified the PDGF-C cleavage site to be between K225/A226 by N-terminal sequencing of GFD of PDGF-C isolated from BHK-570 cells. A later study reported that PDGF-C is a substrate of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in in vitro biochemical assays, and R231 in the hinge region of PDGF-C is essential for its cleavage by tPA. Proteolytically activated PDGF-C stimulates its cognate receptor, \u03b1-PDGFR, but can also activate \u03b2-PDGFR via \u03b1\u03b2-PDGFR heterodimerization.The goals of the present study are to identify breast carcinoma-produced proteases responsible for extracellular proteolytic cleavage of PDGF-C, a key step to initiate PDGF-C/PDGFR signaling, and to investigate the potential oncogenic activities of PDGF-C in breast cancer. Here we identified tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and matriptase as potential activators of PDGF-C in breast cancer. We show that the full-length PDGF-C (FL-PDGF-C) dimer undergoes proteolytic cleavage in a two-step process, creating a hemidimer containing one chain of FL-PDGF-C monomer and one chain of GFD-PDGF-C monomer followed by GFD dimer (GFD-D). Interestingly, while K225 is the putative proteolytic cleavage site, LLGK (aa 222\u2013225) motif appears to be critical for the first cleavage for the generation of hemidimer; both the LLGK and RKSR (aa 231\u2013234) motifs in the hinge region between the CUB and GFD domains of PDGF-C are essential for the second cleavage for the generation of the GFD dimer. Importantly, increased PDGF-C expression in MCF7 cells increased cell proliferation, anchorage independent cell growth, and tumor cell motility, demonstrating a potential oncogenic activity of PDGF-C in breast cancer. Importantly, we also provide evidence that PDGF-C potentiates tumor cell invasion through paracrine signaling in fibroblasts.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and ReagentsCell lines used in this manuscript were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained as recommended. MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells, the resultant MCF7 transfectant cell lines, and murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum. BSC-1 and CV-1 green monkey kidney cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were supplemented with 100units/ml penicillin, 100units/ml streptomycin, 2mM glutamine, and fungizone. The proteases tPA and uPA and the protease inhibitors PAI-1, TAPI, and PDX-Portland were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). HAI-1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Aprotinin and Leupeptin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).Construction of Viral PDGF-C Expression VectorsA reverse transcription-PCR approach was taken to clone PDGF-C into a vaccinia expression vector. Total RNA was isolated from the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 using Trizol reagent and used in cDNA synthesis reactions using SuperScript RT-III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resultant cDNAs were then used in PCR reactions that yielded a 1071-bp product containing the 1035-bp ORF of PDGF-C encoding FL-PDGF-C. Additionally, this product contained the restriction sites for NcoI and BamHI at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, respectively, of the PDGF-C ORF. Further, to the carboxyl-terminus of the PDGF-C product we added a 6X HIS epitope tag (forward, 5\u2019-catgccatggggagcctcttcgggcttctc-3\u2019; reverse 5\u2019-cgggatccctaatggtgatggtgatgatgtcctcctgtgctccctct-3\u2019; the 6X HIS tag is underlined). This product was then digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the NcoI/BamHI site of the vaccinia virus expression vector pTF7-ECM1 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Fridman, Wayne State University). Fidelity of the in-frame sequence encoding the PDGF-C FL: HIS fusion protein was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Elim Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Hayward, CA). This plasmid is referred to as pTF7-PDGF-C FL: HIS. The pTF7-PDGF-C FL: HIS construct was then used as a template in site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutants. Mutations were made at lysine 225 to alanine (K225A), arginines 231 and 234 to alanine (R231/R234A), and lysine 225, arginines 231 and 234 to alanine (K225A/R231A/R234A). Following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for the Quikchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Valencia, CA), primers were designed to create a single mutant at K225A (forward 5\u2019-ccaacttggcaacttcttggcgcggcttttgtttttgg-3\u2019; reverse 5\u2019-ccaaaaacaaaagccgcgccaagaagttgccaagttgg-3\u2019) and a double mutant at R231A/234A (forward 5\u2019-ggcttttgtttttggagcaaaatccgcagtggtggatctg-3\u2019; reverse 5\u2019-cagatccaccactgcggattttgctccaaaaacaaaagcc-3\u2019). After confirmation of sequencing, the pTF7-PDGF-C FL: HIS R231A/234A construct was used as a template for creation of a triple mutant at K225A/R231A/R234A using the same primers that generated the K225A mutant. The sequencing of this construct was then confirmed.Production of Recombinant PDGF-C (rPDGF-C) ProteinEstablished vaccinia virus protocols were followed to generate rPDGF-C ligand. Briefly, CV-1 cells were first infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7-3, which expresses the T7 RNA polymerase. After 30 min. of infection, the cells were washed with PBS and transfected with the plasmid pTF7-PDGF-C FL: HIS, using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Expression of the FL-PDGF-C protein inserted into the pTF7 plasmid is reliant on infection of the cells by vTF7-3. Cell-host machinery then transcribes the gene of interest. Forty-eight hours after co-infection/transfection with vaccinia virus and pTF-7 PDGF-C FL: HIS, the serum-free conditioned media (CM) was collected and cleared of cellular debris by a 5 minute centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7 g. The resultant CM containing FL-PDGF-C protein was used in subsequent PDGF-C processing experiments.Construction of a Mammalian PDGF-C Expression VectorTo insert FL-PDGF-C into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (+) (Invitrogen), a double restriction enzyme digest was performed. The wild-type PDGF-C FL: HIS sequence was first cut from pIND-PDGF-C FL: HIS with the enzymes AflII and BamHI. The resulting product was then gel purified and ligated into the pcDNA3.1 (+) plasmid. This plasmid is referred to as pcDNA3.1-PDGF-C FL: HIS.Establishment of a FL-PDGF-C-Overexpressing MCF7 Breast Carcinoma Cell LineHuman breast carcinoma MCF7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PDGF-C FL: HIS and pcDNA3.1 (+) empty vector using Effectene reagent and then selected using 400\u00b5g/ml Geneticin (G418) in complete culture medium for 12 days. The resulting resistant cells were pooled together and are referred to as MCF7-PDGF-C and MCF7-Neo, respectively. Overexpression of FL-PDGF-C was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR as follows: total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Five \u00b5g of total RNA from each cell line was used to synthesize cDNA using SuperScript RT-III (Invitrogen). Resultant cDNA was then used as a template in a PCR reaction, using Taq Polymerase (Promega, Valencia, CA) and the following primers: forward, 5\u2019-tccagcaacaaggaacagaa-3\u2019 and reverse, 5\u2019-gggtcttcaagcccaaatct-3\u2019. These primers amplify a 200-bp product that represents part of the CUB domain in the FL-PDGF-C protein. This primer pair does not allow for discrimination of endogenously and exogenously expressed FL-PDGF-C. Glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression was used as a positive control with the following primers: forward, 5\u2019-atcaccatcttccaggagcga-3\u2019 and reverse, 5\u2019-gccagtgagcttcccgttca-3\u2019.Custom Antibody Raised Against the PDGF-C Growth Factor DomainAn antibody was raised against the PDGF-C protein using synthetic peptide (N\u2019-CGRKSRVVDLNLLTEEVRLYSC-C\u2019) representing a portion of the PDGF-C Growth Factor Domain (GFD) (amino acids 230\u2013250). The resultant antibody was affinity purified (Zymed Biomedical, So. San Francisco, CA) and is referred to as anti-PDGF-C GFD Ab.PDGF-C-mediated Paracrine Activation of \u03b1-PDGFRMCF7-PDGF-C and MCF7-Neo cells were cultured in serum-free media for 48h. The resultant CM was collected and centrifuged for 5 min. at 2000 rpm to remove cellular debris. Serum-starved NIH3T3 cells were treated with this CM from the MCF7 transfectants for 10 min. Lysates were collected using RIPA lysis buffer [0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 50mM Tris (pH=7.6), 2mM EGTA, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 2mM sodium orthovanadate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1mM sodium fluoride, and protein inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche)]. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min. at 4\u00b0C, 12000 \u00d7 g to remove debris, and the supernatant was collected. Total protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The lysates (500\u00b5g) were then used for immunoprecipitation with an \u03b1-PDGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein G-agarose beads (Pierce Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA lysis buffer and resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE. Tyrosine-phosphorylated \u03b1-PDGFR was detected by immunoblot using a phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Total levels of \u03b1-PDGFR were detected using the same antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Activation assays were repeated three independent times.Inhibition Experiments with MCF7-PDGF-C CellsMCF7-PDGF-C cells were seeded in 6-well plates, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in the presence of serum-free medium with the protease inhibitors Leupeptin, Aprotinin, E64, E64c, TAPI, PAI-1, HAI-1, a tPA blocking antibody, or a uPA blocking antibody for 48h. After incubation, the resultant CM was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, immunoblotted, and probed with anti-PDGF-C GFD Ab. Inhibitory analysis was observed in three separate experimental runs.Ni-NTA Concentration of rPDGF-CrPDGF-C expressed by vaccinia virus contains a 6X-HIS tag at the C-terminal end of FL-PDGF-C. Therefore, a Ni-affinity protocol was used to immunoprecipitate the FL-PDGF-C and/or GFD forms. Briefly, 10X binding buffer (500mM sodium phosphate, 10mM imidazole, and 0.5% Tween-20) was added to CM collected from vaccinia virus co-infected/transfected FL-PDGF-C expressing cells in the presence of a 50% Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose bead slurry (Qiagen). The media and beads were then rocked overnight at 4\u00b0C, after which time the beads are spun down by centrifugation and washed twice in wash buffer (1X binding buffer, 300mM NaCl). The rPDGF-C was then eluted from the beads by incubating them overnight at 4\u00b0C in the presence of 10mM EDTA. This PDGF-C eluate was then aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed for subsequent experiments.In vitro Cleavage of rPDGF-C by tPA, uPA, or MatriptaseLatent rPDGF-C was incubated with various concentrations of human tPA (50mM Tris-HCl pH=7.5, 50mM NaCl) or human uPA (50mM Tris-HCl pH=8.8, 50mM NaCl, 0.1% PEG-4000) for 16\u201318h at 37\u00b0C. For matriptase experiments, latent rPDGF-C was incubated for 2h with varying concentrations of the matriptase catalytic domain (kind gift of Dr. C-Y Lin, University of Maryland) at 37\u00b0C (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl). After incubation, the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-PDGF-C GFD Ab. PDGF-C protease cleavage experiments were verified in three independent experiments.Plasminogen-casein or Casein ZymographyMCF7-PDGF-C and -Neo CM were resolved on an 11% plasminogen-casein SDS-PAGE for 1h at 35mA on ice. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 2.5% Triton-X100 twice, before incubation overnight at 37\u00b0C in 0.1M glycine pH 8.0. The following day the gel was stained for 2 hours at room temperature with gentle agitation in 0.1% amido black. After the incubation, the gel was destained in 30% MeOH, 10% acetic acid. Finally, the gel was placed in a softening solution of 5% glycerol/5% acetic acid for 30 minutes before drying overnight. The gel was subsequently imaged on a Microtek Scanmaker i900 using Photoshop Elements software. Zymographic analysis was repeated three different times.Scratch Migration AssayNIH3T3 fibroblasts were seeded in a 6-well plate and allowed to attach overnight at 37\u00b0C. The next day, these cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C with 1.0ml SF DMEM/F12 media + 25\u00b5g/ml mitomycin C. After incubation, the media was aspirated, and an injury line was scraped with a 1\u2013200\u00b5l yellow pipette tip. The cells were carefully washed once with PBS. Next, 2.0ml of either MCF7-PDGF-C or \u2013Neo CM was added to each of 3 wells. The cells were then placed in the incubator at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. Pictures were taken of the cells every 8 hours to monitor closure of the gap. Using NIH ImageJ, closure was assessed as a percentage of cleared area remaining at time 0, 8, and 16 hrs. Migration assays were repeated three independent times.Soft Agar AnalysisMCF7-PDGF-C and -Neo cells were embedded in a 0.35% Bacto agarose (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) gel at 5,000 cells/mL and laid a 0.6% agarose bottom layer. Experiments were performed in triplicates. Cells were allowed to grow for 2 weeks, then stained with 4% Geimsa (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany). Colonies ranging from 200\u2013500 \u00b5m in size were counted using the Optronix GelCount (Oxford, England). Soft agar analysis was observed in three separate experimental runs.WST-1 Proliferation AssayMCF7-PDGF-C and -Neo cells were plated in a 96-well plate at 2,000 cells per well. Experiments were carried out in sets of 6 wells per cell line. Cells were then treated with the WST-1 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) reagent per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for 3 hours then read on a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA ) at 450nm. PDGF-C mediated cell proliferation was verified in three independent experiments.Matrigel Cell InvasionMCF7-PDGF-C and -Neo cells were plated in serum-free media at a density of 3.75\u00d7105 cells/mL into Matrigel coated transwells (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Transwells were then placed in 24-well containing either serum free media or a confluent layer of serum-starved NIH3T3 cells (co-culture). Invasion was permitted to occur over 48 hours, then transwells were cleaned and stained with 0.9% Crystal Violet. The number of invading cells was counted in 5 different high-powered fields using an inverted Nikon TMS microscope (Melville, NY). Cell invasion analysis was repeated three different times.RESULTSMCF7 cells process PDGF-C into its active growth factor domainTo examine whether breast cancer cells contain the protease(s) responsible for PDGF-C activation and to examine the role of PDGF-C in breast cancer progression, we established MCF7 cells engineered to express PDGF-C (MCF7-PDGF-C) or a control vector (MCF7-Neo) as described in \u201cMaterials and Methods.\u201d PDGF-C overexpression in MCF7-PDGF-C cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1A). Importantly, immunoblot analysis in a reducing condition using conditioned media (CM) collected from these cells in serum-free media detected both the full length monomer (FL-M) of PDGF-C with a molecular weight (Mr) of ~48kDa as well as the processed growth factor domain monomer (GFD-M) of PDGF-C with Mr ~17kDa (Fig. 1B, left panel). Consistently, immunoblot analysis in a non-reducing condition confirmed FL dimer (FL-D) of PDGF-C (~85 kDa) and GFD dimer (GFD-D) of PDGF-C (~26 kDa) (Fig. 1B, right panel). These results demonstrate that breast cancer cells express proteases capable of processing PDGF-C independent of a component in serum, which was previously reported to be a major enzyme to process PDGF-C to its active form. Importantly, we found that breast carcinoma-processed GFD-PDGF-C dimer was biologically active for induction of \u03b1-PDGFR phosphorylation, as demonstrated by a receptor activation assay in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1C).Tumor-derived PDGF-C mediates both paracrine and autocrine signalingSince PDGF was shown to induce a desmoplastic response in breast cancer, we sought to determine whether tumor-derived PDGF-C induces fibroblast cell migration. To this end, a scratch migration assay was performed, whereby NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with CM collected from MCF7-PDGF-C cells demonstrated an increased ability to migrate compared to Neo-treated control (Figure 2A). Next we examined the autocrine effects of tumor-derived PDGF-C on induction of transformed phenotype and tumor cell growth. As shown in Figure 2B and C, increased PDGF-C expression resulted in an increase in anchorage-independent cell growth and an increased cell proliferation as assessed by a soft agar assay and a WST-1 proliferation assay, respectively. Lastly, to assess the effect of PDGF-C on tumor cell invasion, matrigel invasion assays were performed. MCF7 cells were barely invasive in a matrigel invasion assay regardless of PDGF-C expression (Figure 2D). However, when MCF7-PDGF-C and MCF7-Neo cells were seeded on top of transwell filters coated with growth factor reduced-matrigel in the presence of NIH3T3 fibroblasts in the lower chamber, MCF7-PDGF-C cells were more invasive than the Neo control. This suggests that fibroblasts respond to tumor-derived PDGF-C, resulting in secretion of factors that potentiate the invasive phenotype in tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest the potential oncogenic activities of PDGF-C in breast tumor growth, its mediation of tumor-stromal interactions, and tumor cell invasion via both autocrine and paracrine manners.A serine protease processes FL-PDGF-C in MCF7 cellsThe above results indicate that the MCF7 cell line provided a good model to elucidate which protease(s) were capable of activating this growth factor in the context of breast carcinoma cells. To identify the class of protease responsible for the proteolytic processing of FL-PDGF-C, MCF7 cells were cultured in serum-free conditions in the presence of several class-specific protease inhibitors. As shown in Figure 3A, aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, effectively inhibited FL-PDGF-C processing in these cells. Unlike aprotinin, the cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin, the cathepsin inhibitors E64 and E64c, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor TAPI, and the furin inhibitor PDX-Portland showed no significant inhibition of FL-PDGF-C processing, indicating a specific role of serine proteases in the activation of FL-PDGF-C in breast carcinoma. This finding is consistent with a previous report that the serine protease, tPA, is responsible for the processing of PDGF-C in human fibroblasts.To determine whether the plasminogen activator system of proteases plays a role in FL-PDGF-C processing in MCF7 cells, conditioned media was collected from MCF7-PDGF-C cells in the presence of the tPA/uPA specific inhibitor, PAI-1, or in the presence of blocking antibodies against tPA and uPA. As shown in Figure 3B, PAI-1 effectively, although not completely, inhibited proteolytic cleavage of FL-PDGF-C into GFD-PDGF-C. Similarly, tPA blocking antibodies and to a lesser degree uPA blocking antibodies were able to inhibit the processing of PDGF-C. The tPA or uPA activities in CM from MCF7-PDGF-C and MCF7-Neo were confirmed by plasminogen-casein zymography, as shown in Figure 3C. These findings suggest that MCF7-produced tPA and, to a lesser extent, uPA activate PDGF-C.Both tPA and uPA are able to process PDGF-C in vitroTo determine if recombinant tPA and/or uPA can directly process PDGF-C, we first generated recombinant PDGF-C proteins (rPDGF-C) using the vaccinia virus system, followed by purification and concentration using Ni-NTA agarose beads. When rPDGF-C was incubated with increasing concentrations of tPA or uPA overnight at 37\u00b0C, both tPA and uPA were able to process rPDGF-C into the GFD-PDGF-C (Fig. 3D), suggesting PDGF-C is a substrate for tPA and uPA. However, if plasminogen contamination during purification of rPDGF-C exists, uPA/tPA-mediated rPDGF-C processing may be indirect, as tPA and uPA are potent activators of plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme known to cleave PDGF-C. To address this, rPDGF-C was incubated with 100nM streptokinase, a bacterial plasminogen activator. Streptokinase activates plasminogen in a non-proteolytic manner and streptokinase itself has no proteolytic activity of its own. As shown in Figure 2E, in the presence of streptokinase, there was no processing of PDGF-C to its growth domain form, indicating no significant amount of plasminogen to be activated for the processing of PDGF-C in our experimental condition. As a positive control to ensure that streptokinase is functional, rPDGF-C was incubated with streptokinase and 0.3nM plasminogen. As shown in Figure 3E (lane 5), streptokinase-activated plasminogen completely processed rPDGF-C into a smaller size of GFD-PDGF-C. These results demonstrate that both tPA and uPA are able to directly process PDGF-C to its GFD form in vitro, independent of plasmin.Identification of tPA/uPA cleavage sites within the hinge domain of PDGF-CGilbertson, et.al. predicted the serum-sensitive cleavage site of PDGF-C to be RKSR (amino acid residues 231\u2013234), but identified the PDGF-C cleavage site to be between K225/A226 by N-terminal sequencing of the GFD of PDGF-C isolated from BHK-570 cells. A later study reported through mutagenic analysis that R231 in the hinge region of PDGF-C is essential for cleavage by tPA. Taking these results together with our amino acid sequence analysis, we focused on two putative sites, LLGK (aa 222\u2013225) and RKSR (aa 231\u2013234), for uPA and/or tPA-mediated proteolytic cleavage of PDGF-C, as depicted in Figure 4A. By site-directed mutagenesis and the vaccinia virus expression system, rPDGF-C mutants with lysine 225 mutated to alanine (K225A), arginines 231 and 234 to alanines (R231A/R234A), and lysine 225 and arginines 231 and 234 to alanines (K225A/R231A/R234A) were generated. It should be noted that since our study regarding tPA processing of PDGF-C parallels two studies that have been performed by Fredriksson et al., we followed the protocols contained within these studies for comparison of tPA processing of PDGF-C. The greatest inhibition of tPA-mediated proteolytic cleavage was observed in the K225A/R231A/R234A mutant, while the R231A/R234A mutant showed the least inhibition of processing by tPA when the cleavage products were analyzed in a reducing condition (Fig. 4B, top panel). Interestingly, when these samples were analyzed under the non-reducing condition, GFD dimer was generated from WT rPDGF-C proteins only (Fig. 4B bottom panel, lane 2). With the K225A or R231A/R234A mutants, generation of GFD dimer was almost completely inhibited with a noticeable accumulation of a product around Mr~50kD (Fig. 4B bottom panel, lanes 4 and 6). This product has been termed a hemidimer, containing one FL-PDGF-C monomer and one GFD-PDGF-C monomer. When the uPA cleavage site was examined in PDGF-C, K225 in the LLGK motif appears to be more critical than the arginine residues (R231 and R234) in the RKSR motif (Fig. 4C, top panel). Similarly to the tPA-mediated PDGF-C processing, GFD dimer formation was drastically inhibited in these mutants (Fig.4C, bottom panel). These results suggest that K225 in the LLGK motif within the hinge region between the CUB and GFD is critical for tPA- and uPA-mediated first cleavage of PDGF-C for the generation of the hemidimer. However, both LLGK and RKSR motifs are important for the second cleavage for the generation of the GFD-PDGF-C dimer.Matriptase is able to process PDGF-C in vitroIncomplete inhibition of PDGF-C processing in the presence of the tPA/uPA inhibitor, PAI, in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3B) suggested the presence of additional serine proteases with the capacity to process PDGF-C. Interestingly, the serine protease matriptase was shown to have substrate specificity for the amino acid motif RXSR by phage display. Since this putative matriptase cleavage site was found in the RKSR motif in the hinge region of PDGF-C, we sought to investigate if matriptase can process PDGF-C. First, we confirmed matriptase expression in MCF7 cells by immunoblot analysis, as shown in Figure 5A. When rPDGF-C was incubated with varying concentrations of the purified catalytic domain of matriptase for 2 hours, FL-PDGF-C was processed into GFD-PDGF-C by 1-5 nM matriptase, as shown in Figure 5B. To assess if the cleavage site for matriptase was the same as for tPA and uPA, rPDGF-C R231A/R234, K225A, and K225/R231A/R234A mutants were also incubated with 1nM matriptase for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Matriptase-treated rPDGF-C samples were then analyzed by immunoblot analysis under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Similarly to uPA and tPA, K225 was critical for matriptase cleavage of FL-PDGF-C into GFD-PDGF-C as detected under the reducing condition (Fig. 5C, top panel). However, none of these PDGF-C mutant dimers underwent matriptase-mediated proteolytic cleavage in both chains for the generation of the GFD dimer as analyzed under the non-reducing condition (Fig. 5C, bottom panel), suggesting that both LLGK and GRSR motifs are required for matriptase generation of GFD-PDGF-C dimer.To determine whether the GFD dimer and/or hemidimer generated by matriptase have biological activity, we performed the following experiment. WT rPDGF-C and R231A/R234A mutant were incubated with 1nM matriptase for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. The processed PDGF-C was then suspended in serum-free media and utilized for the treatment of serum-starved NIH3T3 cells for 10 minutes, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-\u03b2-PDGFR Ab. \u03b2-PDGFR activation in NIH3T3 cells was chosen as readout for PDGF-C activity for the following reasons. NIH3T3 cells express a high level of \u03b2-PDGFR and PDGF-C was shown to activate \u03b2-PDGFR via \u03b1\u03b2-PDGFR heterodimerization. As shown in Figure 5D, WT rPDGF-C processed by matriptase was biologically active and induced phosphorylation of PDGFR, whereas the hemidimer or GFD monomer generated by matriptase cleavage of R231A/R234A PDGF-C mutant exhibited no biological activity.To determine whether MCF7-produced matriptase is critical for PDGF-C processing and signaling, MCF7-PDGF-C cells were treated with HAI-1, an endogenous inhibitor of matriptase. Generation of the GFD of PDGF-C was reduced, accompanied with accumulation of FL-PDGF-C (Fig. 5E), supporting a role for matriptase in the proteolytic processing of PDGF-C in breast carcinoma. Next, we examined the biological consequence of reduced PDGF-C processing on its ability to activate PDGFR and induce cell motility in a paracrine manner. To this end, serum-starved fibroblasts were treated with conditioned media (CM) collected from MCF7-PDGF-C cells in the absence or presence of HAI-I and analyzed for the status of \u03b2\u2013PDGFR activation and for their motility. As shown in Figure 5F, \u03b2\u2013PDGFR activation was less apparent by treatment with CM from HAI-1 treated cells compared to the non-treated cells. Accordingly, NIH3T3 cell migration was greatly inhibited following treatment with CM from HAI-1 treated MCF7-PDGF-C cells compared to the control (Fig. 5G). Taken together, these results demonstrated a critical role for matriptase in the activation of PDGF-C signaling.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrated that both tPA and uPA can process latent FL-PDGF-C into the active form, whereas our previous study found that uPA, but not tPA, is capable of processing latent PDGF-D into the active form. tPA and uPA belong to the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases, and share a high degree of structural similarity and primary physiological substrates such as plasminogen. Unlike plasmin, they display highly restricted substrate specificity and play unique roles under the physiological and pathological conditions. It is thought that tPA is involved in vascular fibrinolysis, while uPA has been implicated in the immune response, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, cancer growth, and metastasis. Since tPA and uPA have differing physiologic roles yet are similar structurally and exhibit a high degree of substrate specificity, several studies have been performed to understand their basis for recognizing substrate sequences. These studies utilized substrate phage display, phage substrate subtraction library, and positional scanning-synthetic combinatorial library (PS-SCL) techniques to determine specificity. Briefly, substrate phage display identifies the most labile substrates, and substrate subtraction identifies the most selective substrates for a given enzyme, while PS-SCL allows a rapid and minimally difficult technique for the determination of proteolytic substrate specificity. Both tPA and uPA prefer arginine over lysine in the P1 position; however, uPA has less preference for arginine than for lysine, indicating that uPA is a less specific protease than tPA. Both enzymes show similar specificity for Ser/Gly/Ala at the P2 position. Further, the P3 and P4 residues have been shown to be the primary determinants in substrate recognition between tPA and uPA with a P3 arginine and P4 large hydrophobic residue being the most selective for tPA over uPA. In our mutagenesis assays, PDGF-C processing still occurs with R231A mutation. This may result from an introduction of a new cleavage site as a result of mutation. Indeed, the R231A mutation introduces a potential cleavage site at K232 with Ala in the P2 site (R231A). However, although these studies provide insights into the ability of tPA and uPA to cleave certain peptide sequences, it was suggested that the P1\u2013P4 peptide sequences alone are not enough for recognition and cleavage in vivo; there is also a requirement for protease-protein interactions at nearby or distant sites. Consistent with the notion that uPA is a less specific protease than tPA, our previous and present studies found that tPA can cleave PDGF-C only, while uPA can process both PDGF-C and -D.A previous report by Fredriksson, et al. has demonstrated that tPA processing of PDGF-C requires R231 in the RKSR (aa 231\u2013234) motif in the hinge region to mediate proteolytic activation of PDGF-C. This conclusion was reached by site-directed mutagenesis of PDGF-C followed by in vitro cleavage assay with tPA and a PDGF receptor activation assay. While this conclusion is valid, our study provided an alternative K225 processing site and further insight into PDGF-C processing by tPA as well uPA and matriptase. Our results indicate that K225 in the LLGK (aa 222\u2013225) motif is more critical for the first cleavage generation of the PDGF-C hemidimer. In line with this finding, the K225 site was the cleavage site of PDGF-C sequenced by Gilbertson et al. in BHK-570 cells. More importantly, our study showed that both the LLGK and RKSR motifs are essential for generation of the biologically active GFD-PDGF-C dimer. These results suggest differences in the structure of the hinge regions of the two PDGF-C chains for the recognition/access of serine proteases to latent PDGF-C for proteolytic activation. Our results also provide important information that the presence of GFD-PDGF-C detected under reducing conditions may not be a good predictor for the biological activity of PDGF-C.The present study also identified matriptase as a potential activator of PDGF-C in breast cancer. Matriptase was first identified as the major gelatinase in hormone-dependent human breast cancer cells, and since its initial discovery, matriptase has been cloned by several laboratories and has shown a restricted epithelial expression profile in both human and murine tissues. At present, only a handful of substrates have been identified, including proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), single chain uPA, the pro-form of MT-SP1, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Importantly, increasing evidence suggested a critical role for matriptase in human cancers, as it is highly expressed in carcinomas of the head and neck, mesothelium, breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. Dysregulated matriptase activity is thought to directly affect the extracellular microenvironment during cancer progression through altering processing of matrix components, could act through downstream effector molecules such as growth factors and receptors, chemokines, or protease zymogens, leading to their activation or deactivation. Our finding suggests the possibility of matriptase\u2019s oncogenic activity involving activation of PDGF-C signaling.The relative biological significance of tPA, uPA, and matriptase for the regulation of PDGF-C activity in vivo is likely to depend on the bioavailability of these enzymes in a given microenvironment. The expression and role of the plasminogen system has been extensively studied during tumor progression and showed increased expression/activity of uPA and tPA in several tumor types including breast cancer, gliomas, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer. In a recent study of breast cancer patient tissue samples, uPA and uPAR expression was correlated with increasing tumor stage and in breast cancer bone metastases by in situ hybridization analyses. However, a role for tPA in breast cancer is unclear. One study showed that tPA expression in breast cancer is not associated with the malignant or benign state. Another report states that low intratumoral tPA expression levels correlate with aggressiveness and poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Irrespective of these reports, increased PDGF-C expression and serine protease-mediated proteolytic activation of PDGF-C in human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells resulted in fibroblast migration in a paracrine manner as well as increased MCF7 cell proliferation and anchorage independent growth in an autocrine manner. In addition, serine protease-activated PDGF-C signaling induced an invasive phenotype in MCF7 cells in the presence of fibroblasts. These results suggest the potential for regulatory crosstalk between extracellular serine proteases and PDGF signaling as being critical for carcinoma growth as well as for tumor-stromal interactions leading to tumor invasion.Furthermore, we utilized the Oncomine database (Compendium Biosciences), which is a compendium of published cDNA arrays from over 100 institutions that allows for gene comparison across multiple array studies, in an effort to obtain information as to which serine protease(s) is (are) likely to be available for PDGF-C activation during breast cancer progression. Using this tool, we found that among the PDGF family members, PDGF-C and its cognate receptor \u03b1-PDGFR were more likely to be upregulated during breast cancer progression. Interestingly, while only one out of 19 studies reported an increase in tPA expression in breast carcinoma, almost all studies found increases in matriptase and uPA in breast cancer tissues (Supplementary Table 1). Lastly, our laboratory (Meng et al., manuscript under review) demonstrated in a tissue microarray analysis of 216 patients with invasive breast cancer that increased PDGF-C expression correlates with lymph node metastasis, increased Ki-67 proliferation staining, and lower rates of 7-yr disease free survival, providing compelling evidence for PDGF-C in human breast cancer progression. Taken together, matriptase and uPA are more likely than tPA to be the relevant enzymes for PDGF-C activation, contributing to breast cancer progression.Supplementary Material           CONFLICT OF INTEREST         The authors declare no conflict of interest.

        "content": "The expression of growth factors for mesenchymal cells was investigated in 10 different human mammary carcinoma cell lines. Expression of mRNA for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain, PDGF B-chain, transforming growth factor-alpha, and insulin-like growth factor II were found in eight, nine, five, and two of the cell lines, respectively. The production of PDGF-like growth factors by the mammary carcinoma cell lines was investigated in detail. PDGF receptor competing activity and mitogenic activity, which could be neutralized by PDGF antibodies, were found in the conditioned medium of almost all the cell lines. A PDGF-like growth factor was partially purified from the conditioned medium of one of the cell lines, MCF7. A Mr 31,000 component, which was reduced to Mr 17,000, was furthermore precipitated by a PDGF antiserum from the conditioned medium of metabolically labeled MCF7 cells. These results indicate that growth factors for mesenchymal cells are frequently expressed in human mammary carcinoma cell lines. This is of interest in relation to the fact that mammary carcinoma tumors often contain a high proportion of proliferating connective tissue cells.",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The horse anti\u2010mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)\u2010horseradish peroxidase (#7076), and goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG\u2010HRP (#7074\u2009S) secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min. Upper panels, representative images of adherent cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panel, adhesion was quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm). Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay. Left panels, representative images of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 wound healing over time (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a016\u2009h) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm. Right panel, wound healing (wound width, in \u03bcm) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) was quantified over time. The data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment. (D) Cell invasion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroids embedded in collagen I gel were let to invade in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 3\u2009days. Left panels, representative images of invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Right panel, the invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell area was quantified using Image J. Data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test).DISCUSSIONHere, we showed that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed in both tumor and stromal cells, and that its expression in CAFs independently predicts RFS in patients with TNBC. Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

        "content": "Fibroblasts are among the most abundant stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), progressively differentiating into activated, motile, myofibroblast-like, protumorigenic cells referred to as Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). To investigate the mechanisms by which epithelial cells direct this transition, the early stages of tumorigenesis were exemplified by indirect cocultures of WI-38 or human primary breast cancer fibroblasts with human mammary epithelial cells expressing an inducible c-Myc oncogene (MCF10A-MycER). After c-Myc activation, the conditioned medium (CM) of MCF10A-MycER cells significantly enhanced fibroblast activation and mobilization. As this was accompanied by decreased insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 (IGFBP-6) and increased insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGF-II (IGF-I, IGF-II) in the CM, IGFs were investigated as key chemotactic factors. Silencing IGFBP-6 or IGF-I or IGF-II expression in epithelial cells or blocking Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) activity on fibroblasts significantly altered fibroblast mobilization. Exposure of WI-38 fibroblasts to CM from induced MCF10A-MycER cells or to IGF-II upregulated FAK phosphorylation on Tyr<sup397</sup , as well as the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), features associated with CAF phenotype and increased cell migratory/invasive behavior. In three-dimensional (3D)-organotypic assays, WI-38 or human primary fibroblasts, preactivated with either CM from MCF10A-MycER cells or IGFs, resulted in a permissive TME that enabled nontransformed MCF10A matrix invasion. This effect was abolished by inhibiting IGF-1R activity. Thus, breast epithelial cell oncogenic activation and stromal fibroblast transition to CAFs are linked through the IGFs/IGF-1R axis, which directly promotes TME remodeling and increases tumor invasion.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "A considerable fraction of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is located in the fibroblast-rich stromal compartment of desmoplastic breast carcinoma. We analyzed the migratory activity of blood monocytes (MO), the precursor cells of TAM, into 3-D cultures of carcinoma cells and fibroblasts from breast tumor origin. MO migration into breast tumor spheroids was highly variable: Hs578T spheroids showed high MO infiltration rates, T47D cultures were intermediate, whereas BT549, BT474 and MCF-7 spheroids were poorly infiltrated. MO infiltration was also high in tumor-derived fibroblast spheroids; however, no MO subpopulation with specific infiltrative potential was identified by CD14/CD16 expression profile. The infiltration of MO could be inhibited by pre-exposure to pertussis and cholera toxins, but only pertussis toxin, which blocks G(i) protein function, entirely inhibited MO migration. The G(i) coupled CCL2 receptor CCR2A/2B was expressed on roughly all MO. Furthermore, highly infiltrated tumor-derived fibroblast and Hs578T spheroids secreted considerable amounts of CCL2. In line with this, the infiltration of MO into fibroblast spheroids was suppressed by either addition of recombinant CCL2 to disturb the CCL2 gradient or by pre-incubation of MO with a CCR2A/2B blocking antibody. MO infiltration of Hs578T spheroids, however, could not be inhibited by CCL2 receptor blockade. Our study clearly shows that the CCL2-CCR2A/2B pathway is crucial for the recruitment of blood MO into tumor fibroblastic areas, whereas additional factors may be relevant for the migration of MO into tumor cell sites.",

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

These findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.1. IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed to assess differences in CD117+ cells within the total BM population.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and either formalin-fixed or snap-frozen. (a\u2013g) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and stained with (a\u2013c) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or (e\u2013g) subjected to immunohistochemistry with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification for the presence of metastatic tumor cells (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a,e) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (b,f) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (c,g) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. (d) Positive control; MCF7 primary human breast tumor tissue. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels (a\u2013c) and top panels (d\u2013g) and high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels (a\u2013c) and bottom panels (d\u2013g). (h) DNA was isolated from snap-frozen lung tissue from tumor-na\u00efve control mice, MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and SUM159 tumor-bearing mice (n = 15/group) and subjected to qPCR analysis using primers specific to the human ALU sequence.Expression of the premetastatic niche markers fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 is enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, lungs were harvested and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against murine fibronectin (FN) (a,e,i); tenascin-c (TNC) (b,f,j); periostin (POSTN) (c,g,k) or MMP9 (d,h,l) prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/lung/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a\u2013d) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (e\u2013h) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (i\u2013l) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels); high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels).Mice bearing triple negative SUM159 tumors demonstrate increased mRNA expression of the premetastatic markers fibronection, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX and CCL2 in the lungs. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and snap-frozen. RNA was isolated from lungs and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to assess the expression of murine fibronectin (a), tenascin-c (b), periostin (c), MMP9 (d), collegen A1 (e), LOX (f) and CCL2 (g) (n = 15 mice/group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. \u03b1 = significantly different from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls. \u03b2 = significantly different from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.005).The presence of a triple-negative SUM159 breast tumor modifies the soluble lung microenvironment to enhance breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and used for the generation of lung-conditioned media (LCM) as described previously. To assess migration, (a) SUM159 or (b) MCF7 cells were subjected to transwell migration assays for 18 h as described in the Materials & Methods. To assess proliferation, (c) SUM159 or (d) MCF7 cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation assays as described in the Materials & Methods.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

It was estimated in 2018 that more than 2.1 million women were newly diagnosed with breast cancer with 600,000 deaths and 2.3 million new cases are estimated by 2030. Although breast conservation surgery combined with neoadjuvant therapy can reduce the mortality rate, some breast cancer patients have potential drug-resistance genetic profiles leading to the unsatisfactory outcome of treatments.Breast cancer is categorized into 4 major subtypes based on the presence or absence of molecular markers by immunohistochemical staining for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2): luminal subtypes, A and B: ER-positive and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative (luminal A) or -positive (luminal B) accounted for 70% of breast cancer cases; HER2-positive subtype: ER- and/or PR-negative/HER2-positive with an estimation of 15\u201320%, and triple-negative (TN) or basal subtype: lacking all ER/PR/HER2 with around 15% of the total cases. Luminal and HER2-positive subtypes respond well to standard treatment; however, some of them have treatment failures. The TN subtype is of great interest to explore since having no ER/PR/HER2, these patients with advanced stage have no targeted drugs available.Several breast cancer cell lines have been widely used in research to unravel the mechanisms of cancer progression and drug resistance driven by certain genes. There are 27 TN breast cancer cell lines used in breast cancer research filed of which MDA-MB-231 is the most popular cell line with high proliferative, invasive, and metastatic properties. The trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive MDA-MB-453 cell line has an abnormal gene expression profile, in particular, the upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin-liked growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3). Although, novel breast cancer cell lines have been established, no recent cell models of TN and HER2-positive subtypes have been reported for mechanistic investigation of metastasis and drug resistance.In the present study, two novel breast cancer cell lines designated as PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA were established from fresh breast cancer tissues. The epithelial markers and chromosome aberrations were investigated to confirm epithelial-derived cancer cells. The 2-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D tumor spheroids and 3-D organoids were used to demonstrate the tumorigenic phenotypes including cell proliferation, cell growth, cell migration, cancer stemness (CSCs) and doxorubicin (DOX)/paclitaxel (PTX) resistance. The DNA sequences of drug-targeted genes were investigated and discussed for the chemotherapeutic and target drugs response of these cells. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was checked to propose its use for the sensitivity of cancer cells by T cell killing. The obtained findings revealed that PC-B-148CA is a good TN breast cancer model for investigating migration and cancer stemness properties, while PC-B-142CA is a new HER2-positive breast cancer model for drug resistance.Materials and methodsCancer cell isolation and cultureBreast cancer tissues were obtained from two patients who underwent surgery at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, designated as PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA. PC-B-142CA was derived from a 58-year-old female patient diagnosed with stage IV HER-2 positive breast cancer, while PC-B-148CA was isolated from a 50-year-old female patient diagnosed with stage II TN breast cancer.The tissue collection protocol was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board (COA no. Si 329/2017). Single cell suspensions from tumor tissues were prepared using the GentleMACS single cell isolation machine (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the tissues were minced into 1\u20132 mm3 pieces and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with the enzyme cocktail mix (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). The digested cells were harvested and filtered over a 70 \u00b5m nylon filter (SPL Life Sciences). The cell suspensions were washed by centrifugation and the cell pellets were resuspended in DMEM F/12 media (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF, PeproTech, Inc.), 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), 0.32 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and 10 \u00b5M ROCK inhibitor (Y27632, StemMACS, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). The contaminated fibroblasts were isolated using a tumor cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). The primary breast cancer cells were cultured in DMEM F/12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and 10X antibiotic mixture containing 1 U/ml penicillin G sodium and 1 mg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Cells were subcultured, periodically checked for negative mycoplasma and kept in liquid nitrogen for storage.Commercial human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 (purchased from American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml of streptomycin (both from Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA).Detection of epithelial markers by immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence stainingCell pellets were fixed in 10% formalin and subjected for staining on sterile glass coverslips by antibodies against estrogen receptor (rabbit anti-ER monoclinal antibody, 790-4325, ready-to-use; clone SP1, Ventana Laboratories), progesterone receptor (rabbit anti-PR monoclonal antibody, 790-4296, ready-to-use; clone 1E2, Ventana Laboratories) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (rabbit anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, 790-2991, ready-to-use; clone 4B5, Ventana Laboratories). This process was performed by the routine service at the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. Ki-67 (1:300 dilution, M7240, rabbit anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody, clone MIB-1, Dako Laboratories; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) percentages at cut-point <14% were defined as luminal A subtype.The epithelial cytokeratin (CK) including CK-4, \u22125, \u22126, \u22128, \u221210, \u221213, \u221218 and \u221219 were investigated. \u03b1-SMA and FAP, specific markers for the stromal fibroblast, were used as a quality control of cancer cell purity. The presence of PD-L1 was evaluated for the ability of the obtained cancer cells to resist T cell killing. Cells at 1\u00d7104 were plated on sterile glass coverslips for 24 h, fixed in ice-cold absolute methanol, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-1X PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber with the indicated primary antibody as follows: mouse anti-human panCK antibody (dilution 1:200, sc-8018, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-human CK-19 antibody (dilution 1:200, sc-6278, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-human \u03b1-SMA antibody (dilution 1:500, A5228, Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), rabbit anti-human fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibody (dilution 1:500 ab53066, Abcam), and rabbit anti-human PD-L1 antibody (dilution 1:500, ab205921, Abcam). The goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 antibody (dilution 1:2,000, #115-166-071, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) or the donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (dilution 1:2,000, 21206, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was applied for 3 h at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with 1:2,000 Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Fluorescence was captured with a ZEISS LSM 800 confocal laser fluorescence scanning microscope (Axio Observer7, LSM 800, Zeiss GmbH).Three-dimensional (3-D) spheroid and 3-D organoid formationSpheroids were created by 1\u00d7103 breast cancer cells supplemented with 2.5% cold Matrigel\u2122 (BD Biosciences) in 200 \u00b5l of complete DMEM F/12 medium and seeded into individual wells of pre-cooled 96-well ultra-low attachment multiple well plates (CLS7007, Costar/Corning, Inc.). Centrifugation at 4\u00b0C at 300 \u00d7 g for 3 min was performed and the cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 5 days to form spheroids. Medium was renewed twice weekly and the proliferation rate of spheroids was monitored for up to 10 days. For the organotypic cultures, 1\u00d7104 of PC-B-142 and PC-B-148CA cells were generated in 24-well clear flat bottom ultra-low attachment multiple well plates (CLS3473, Costar/Corning, Inc.) at the concentration of 4% cold Matrigel\u2122 (BD Biosciences) in 300 \u00b5l of complete DMEM F/12 medium. The plate was placed in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. The organoid culture medium was refreshed with 300 \u00b5l complete DMEM F/12 medium every 2\u20133 days. The organoid culture was ended on day 14.Cell proliferation and colony formation assaysGrowth curves of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cells, compared to commercial cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, were determined by using the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (G3581, Promega.) assay following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5,000 cells were seeded in each well of 96-well plates in complete DMEM F/12 medium and cultured overnight in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. At time intervals, 20 \u00b5l of MTS reagent was added to each well, followed by incubation in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere for a minimum of 2 h. Absorbance at 490 nm was recorded at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. For the colony formation assay, 2,000 cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates in complete DMEM F/12 medium and cultured overnight. The medium was refreshed every 3 days. At day 10, the adherent cells were washed with 1X PBS, fixed with cold methanol, and stained with a 0.5% crystal violet solution. The colony numbers were counted by photometric measurements using CellCounter software version 0.2.1 (Nghia, Ho) and a 1\u20135 \u00b5m diameter colony was determined as one colony. Three independent experiments were performed for each assay condition.Drug cytotoxicity assayThe 2-D culture was treated for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 \u00b5M DOX (Selleckchem) or PTX (Selleckchem) diluted in 10% FBS of DMEM/F12 medium. The selected concentrations at 0.1, 1 and 10 \u00b5M of DOX or PTX were tested in 3-D spheroids for 72 h. The 2-D killing was measured by the MTS assay and cell viability of 3-D killing was analyzed by the calculation of the volume (\u00b5m3) with the formula 4/3\u03c0r3 in a spheroid with or without drug treatment.Cell migration assayFor the wound healing assay, 5\u00d7104 cells were adhered in a 24-well plate and cultured until they reached >90% confluency. Scratch wounds were made with a sterile yellow tip pipette. The cells were incubated in complete 10% FBS DMEM F/12 and the wound area was recorded and digitally photographed at 30 min, 18 and 24 h by an inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus). The closing of the wound gap was calculated using ImageJ software version 1.48v (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Quantification of cell migration was determined with the formula: Migration area=(Area of original wound-Area of wound after healing)/Area of original wound. Cell migration was performed in 8.0-\u00b5m Transwell Boyden chambers (Corning, Inc.). A total of 5\u00d7104 cells in serum-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber insert. Subsequently, 500 \u00b5l of DMEM F/12 medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. Then at 24 h, the cells which passed through the membrane were fixed with absolute methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and quantitated with ImageJ software version 1.48v.Western blot analysisCells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 0.5 M NaF, 0.2 M NaVO4, 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M EDTA, 2.5 M NaCl, 10% (v/v) NP-40, 10% (w/v) SDS, Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktails (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The proteins were quantitated by Bradford kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl.). Sixty micrograms of protein lysates were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories Srl.). The proteins were blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk diluted in 1X TBS/0.1% Tween-20. Primary antibodies against E-cadherin (1:1,000 dilution, mouse anti-human E-cadherin antibody, 13-1700, Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), MMP-9 (1:200 dilution, mouse anti-human MMP-9 antibody, 2C3, sc-21733, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), MMP-13 (1:100 dilution, rabbit anti-human MMP-13 antibody, H-230, sc-30073, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), BAX (mouse anti-human BAX antibody, 1:1,000 dilution, 610983, Becton Dickinson Holdings Pte. Ltd.), BCL-2 (rabbit anti-human BCL-2 antibody, 1:2,000 dilution, ab196495, Abcam) and \u03b2-actin (1:10,000 dilution, sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used. The immunoreactive signals were visualized by ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) under Gel Document Syngene (Syngene). The bands were quantified by ImageJ version 1.48v. \u03b2-actin was used as the loading control protein to verify the amount of total loading protein.Targeted next-generation sequencingThe genomic DNA isolation of PC-B-142CA, PC-B-148CA, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 was performed using Cobas\u00ae DNA sample preparation kit (05985536190, Hoffman-La Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. The quantity of the extracted DNA samples was determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). One-hundred nanograms of DNA was used as a template to generate libraries by the GeneRead QIAact AIT DNA UMI Kit (181911, Qiagen) and the GeneRead QIAact BRCA Advanced DNA UMI panel (181925, Qiagen). Sequencing was performed by the GeneReader NGS System (Qiagen). GeneRead UMI Advanced Sequencing Q Kit (185251, Qiagen), GeneRead UMI Advanced Sequencing Q Wash Buffers (185905, Qiagen) were used according to the manufacturer instructions. Single-end sequencing was performed on the GeneReader NGS System (Qiagen). The single-end sequencing was performed. The average read lengths were as follows: MDA-MB-231 [AIT panel: 121.90 base pairs (bps)], MCF-7 (AIT panel: 111.38 bps), PC-B-142CA (AIT panel: 132.57 and BRCA panel: 126.73 bps), and PC-B-148CA (AIT panel: 119.04 and BRCA panel: 99.17 bps). Quality control and variant data reviews were performed in Qiagen Clinical Insight Analyze. Qiagen Clinical Insight Interpret software was used for variant interpretation and reporting. The sequences were submitted to GenBank database () under the accession number: PRJNA762209 (). The BioSample accession numbers were: SAMN21380367, SAMN21380368, SAMN21380369, SAMN21380370, SAMN21380371 and SAMN21380372, respectively.Cancer stem cell analysisPC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cells were harvested and incubated with Allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-CD44 (21270446, ImmunoTools GmbH, Friesoythe Germany, 1:10 dilution) and FITC-labeled anti-CD24 (21270443, ImmunoTools GmbH, 1:10 dilution) antibodies in 1X PBS/2% FBS for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Mouse IgG1 control FITC-conjugated (21275513, ImmunoTools GmbH) and mouse IgG1 control APC-conjugated (21275516, ImmunoTools GmbH) were used as the isotype controls. The CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) was used for flow cytometric and data analysis using CytExpert software version 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).Data collection and statistical analysisThe values are represented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) from three independent assays. All statistical calculations were performed with the SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.). The data from two groups were analyzed by paired Student's t-tests and from multiple groups by one-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post-hoc test using GraphPad Prism software version 7.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) or SigmaPlot 16.0v (Systat Software, Inc.). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsCharacterizations of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CAPC-B-142CA cells were isolated from stage IV HER2-positive breast cancer tissues with pathological features of negative ER and PR, positive HER2 (>90%) and Ki-67 (47%). PC-B-148CA was derived from a patient diagnosed with stage II TN breast cancer with negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, but positive Ki-67 (84%) (Table I). Fingerprint results confirmed different origins of these 2 cell lines (Table SI). The PC-B-148CA fingerprint was identical to that of the white blood cells of the patient whose tissue was used to establish PC-B-148CA (data not shown), while that of PC-B-142CA could not be checked due to the unavailability of the sample. The immunocytochemical staining results confirmed PC-B-142CA as a HER2-positive breast cancer cell line, and PC-B-148CA as a TN breast cancer cell line (Table I). PC-B-142CA revealed a great karyotypic heterogeneity with 38 chromosomes with a monosomy X chromosome (Fig. 1A) whereas PC-B-148CA had around 47\u201358 chromosomes with loss of sex chromosomes and several numerical and structural rearrangements and unidentifiable aberrations (Figs. 1B and S1).The colony formation assay exhibited that TN PC-B-148CA had a significantly slower growth rate than the commercial TN MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1C and D). PC-B-142CA formed a colony faster than PC-B-148CA, but slower that MDA-MB-231. PC-B-142CA had a very small size and grew in cluster of cells, whereas PC-B-148CA showed a polygonal shape (Fig. 1E). The growth rates of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA were lower than those of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 (Fig. 1F). PC-B-148CA had the slowest growth rate among these four cells with a doubling time of 155.7\u00b15.2 h, while that of PC-B-142CA was 45.0\u00b13.0 h (Table I).Morphology and cellular markers of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CAPC-B-142CA cells adhered to form a big tight colony with blurred cell borders (Fig. 2A, bright field), while PC-B-148CA exhibited characteristic of spindle shape with multiple processes and seldom multinucleated cells (Fig. 2C, bright field). PC-B-148CA had a bigger cell size than PC-B-142CA. Both cells were positive for all CKs but no \u03b1-SMA and FAP fibroblast markers were detected (Fig. 2A and C). PD-L1 was found in both PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA. The immunocytochemistry staining confirmed positive expression of HER2 in PC-B-142CA, whereas negative ER, PR and HER2 were detected in PC-B-148CA (Fig. 2A and C). The 3-D spheroid of PC-B-142CA was larger than that of PC-B-148CA (Fig. 2B and D). The 3-D mean diameter continuously increased with time from 0.048\u00b10.04 \u00b5m3 at day 0 to 0.118\u00b10.21 \u00b5m3 at day 5 for PC-B-142CA and from 0.021\u00b10.04 \u00b5m3 at day 0 to 0.095\u00b10.058 \u00b5m3 at day 5 for PC-B-148CA. The aggregation and compaction of 3-D organotypic modeling was observed at day 14 of culture. The 3-D organoids of PC-B-142CA exhibited a round shape with smooth surface, whereas those of PC-B-148CA had invadopodia representing the specialized adhesive structures capable to invade surrounding tumor microenvironment. This similar feature was also observed in the PC-B-148CA spheroid.Migration and cancer stem cell properties of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CAMBA-MB-231 TN breast cancer cells confirmed their most rapid migration by wound healing and Transwell migration assays in 10% FBS media (Fig. 3A and D). The results showed that PC-B-148CA closed a 70% wound gap at 24 h (Fig. 3A and C), while at this time point, PC-B-142CA had only 30% wound closure and needed more than 96 h to completely heal the wound gap (data not shown). We tried to culture it in serum free, unluckily, the cells did not grow confluently and we could not do wound scratching. The primary cells did not tolerate serum starving as well as the established cell lines, hence wound healing assay in our experiment was performed in the presence of serum. The doubling times of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA were approximately 45\u00b13.0 and 155.7\u00b15.2 h, respectively, implying that within 24 h of this assay, cells did not proliferate. The Transwell migration assay essentially confirmed the migration capability observations from high to low as: MBD-MB-231>PC-B-148CA>MCF-7>PC-B-142CA (Fig. 3D). The western blot analysis of the proteins involved in cancer cell migration exhibited that E-cadherin was basally expressed in all 4 cell lines in this study and showed the highest level in MCF-7, especially, the 120-kDa mature isoform whereas MMP-9 and MMP-13 were markedly higher in MDA-MD-231 and PC-B-148CA cells (Fig. 3E-H).CD24\u2212/CD44+ representing cancer stem cells (CSCs) of breast cancer, were detected in PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA as 8.75 and 96.9% (Fig. 3I and J). MDA-MB-231 had around 98.1% CSCs, while that of MCF-7 was 65.0%.DOX and PTX resistance of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CATo determine the relevant toxic concentration of DOX and PTX, the breast cancer cells were exposed to the increasing concentrations of DOX and PTX (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 \u00b5M) and cell viability was assayed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. In 2-D culture, 0.01 \u00b5M of DOX (Fig. 4C) or 1 \u00b5M of PTX (Fig. 4D) was the minimum concentration which elicited the highest toxic effect in PC-B-148CA cells, whereas no cytotoxic effect was found in the PC-B-142CA cell line (Fig. 4A and B). Interestingly, 3-D spheroid formation showed that after exposure to 1 \u00b5M DOX and 10 \u00b5M PTX, the size of tumor spheroids was significantly reduced from the control without drug treatment in PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cells at 72 h (Fig. 4E and F). Moreover, DOX and PTX-treated PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA increased the pro-apoptotic BAX protein, while decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein (Fig. 4G and H).Mutation of the drug-targeted genesDrug-targeted gene mutations were checked in the PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cells in comparison to those in the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Table II). The pathogenic mutations represented the variants well established as disease causing including KIT (E839K, 50.0%), PIK3CA (C420R, 68.0%), SMAD4 (Q224*, 100.0%, * represented stop codon), and TP53 loss-of-function (I202T, 98.0%) were detected in PC-B-142CA, whereas BRCA2 (T3033fs*11, 16.0%) and TP53 (R196*, 100%) loss-of-function, and NRAS gain-of-function (G12C, 35.0%) were found in PC-B-148CA. ERBB2 amplification and PIK3CA mutation at exon 8 (c.1258T>C, 68%) were found in PC-B-142CA.DiscussionThe incidence of breast cancer in females is increasing worldwide. Luminal breast cancer is the most common subtype whereas HER2-positive is the second most common. High local recurrence and bone metastasis in patients with luminal breast cancer is commonly detected during a 2- to 5-year period. The median overall survival for metastatic TN breast cancer is approximately 1 year compared to approximately 5 years for the other 2 subtypes. Moreover, drug resistance is common in all breast cancer types despite the different treatment modalities applied. Several breast cancer cell lines are existing and widely used in research fields. In the present work, two novel cell lines from tumor tissues of two breast cancer patients diagnosed with HER2-positive and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer were established and designated as PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA. The characterization for their biological, molecular, and genetic properties confirmed that PC-B-148CA had high aggressive properties including migration, doxorubicin (DOX)/paclitaxel (PTX) resistance and stemness properties, whereas HER2-positive PC-B-142CA had pathogenic gene mutations related to the resistance to several chemotherapeutic drugs.Both PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cell lines grew as adherent monolayer cells with morphology of epithelial cells. The PC-B-142CA proliferation rate doubling time compared to PC-B-148CA was around 45 vs. 155 h. The presence of fibroblast-activation protein (FAP) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) confirmed the characteristic of cancer-associated fibroblasts, whereas the presence of cytokeratin (CK) represented cancer cells. Thus, having negative \u03b1-SMA and FAP, with positive CK ensures the purity of PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA without fibroblast contamination. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in both PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cell lines implies the ability of these cells to resist T cell killing as PD-L1 is a checkpoint molecule acting as a break to inhibit T cell function. Atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, has just been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with PD-L1-positive, non-operable, locally advanced/metastatic TN breast cancer. Hence, PD-L1-expressing PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cells may be a valuable aid in the search to overcome immune checkpoint-mediated T cell dysfunction in breast cancer.It is widely acknowledged that cancer stem cells (CSCs) serve as an important part in the occurrence and development of tumors on account of their ability for self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation and induction of tumor growth. Surface CD44, overexpressed in several types of cells, is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis and recurrence. PC-B-148CA showed the highest stemness property. TN breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, Hs578T, SUM1315 and HBL-100 with a higher percentage of CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells (>30%) express higher levels of pro-invasive genes and are highly invasive. PC-B-148CA cells showed marked migration activity when compared to the PC-B-142CA cells. This property was found to be correlated with the histological data of the tissue of origin of PC-B-148CA cells including invasive lobular carcinoma and angiolymphatic invasion. Serum starving is the most common non-pharmaceutical method for minimizing proliferation in wound healing assays, but the degree of serum starving has to be calculated for each cell type under investigation. Please note that primary cells do not tolerate serum starving as well as established cell lines. PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cells were tested for their migration capability in the presence of serum. Hence, the proliferation parameter cannot be ruled out from this assay results.Metastatic cancer cells invade surrounding tissues and blood vessels by forming F-actin-rich protrusions known as invadopodia, which degrade the extracellular matrix and enable invasion of tumor cells. The proportion of CD44+/CD24\u2212 in breast cancer cell populations has been reported to enrich mammosphere formation and tumorigenesis in mice and have been well studied. Invadopodia were observed in PC-B-148CA cells forming as 3-D structures, both spheroid and organoid. A key step in tumor progression is the transition of stationary epithelial cells to become motile by the loss of cell-cell adhesion and matrix degradation. The process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) exhibits molecular hallmark by downregulation of E-cadherin. The phenotype of cell migration was consistent with the western blot analysis which revealed low expression of E-cadherin in the PC-B-148CA cells. All of these characteristics support the high invasive property of PC-B-148CA cells. However, MCF-7 cells have a high E-cadherin, yet a high migration rate was detected. This may be explained by the fact that not only the E-cadherin level reflects the migration ability, but also other proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and N-cadherin were previously found with high levels in MCF-7 cells. In breast cancer, overexpression of several MMPs has been reported which is generally associated with breast tumor progression. MMP-9 is a potential biomarker which is widely found to play a role in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis and to mediate tumor microenvironment. MMP-9 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells was found to be significantly higher than in normal breast cells. Since MMP-13 is expressed in a broad range of breast cancer cells, it has emerged as a novel metastatic biomarker. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that secrete higher levels of MMP-13 are less aggressive than MCF7 cells. Consistent with our results, MMP-9 and MMP-13 were highly expressed in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and PC-B-148CA cells when compared with these levels in PC-B-142CA cells. The lack of N-cadherin expression assessment is a limitation of this study.The 3-D spheroid and 3-D organoid models enable mimicking of the in vivo tumor condition in patients. Both PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cell lines showed the capability of producing 3-D multicellular tumor spheroids and 3-D tumor organoids. Additionally, cells within tumor spheroids may have activities similar as that in a patient's body, promotion of migration and invasion; such features are absent in 2D culture. The different sensitivity to DOX or PTX was detected in these two cell lines. DOX and PTX had a strong impact on the spheroid size of both PC-B-142CA and PC-B-148CA cell lines, with small size and outer loose layer of sphere cells in a dose-dependent manner.In the mutation analysis, ERBB2 (a gene encoding the HER2 protein) amplification found in PC-B-142CA cells was consistent with the presence of HER2 by an immunocytochemistry result and confirmed that it had originated from HER2-positive breast cancer tissue. Five mutations of drug-targeted genes including KIT, PIK3CA, SMAD4 and TP53 found in PC-B-142CA together with the ERBB2 amplification are related to the resistance of several targeted drugs. Amplification of HER2 together with PIK3CA may aggravate the resistance to HER2-targeted drugs and suggest the combination of treatment with PI3K inhibitors. Multiple advances in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer due to multiple mutated genes were found leading to the benefit of the combination of HER2 and targeted inhibitors. PI3KCA mutant HER2-positive bearing mice demonstrated tumor regression after combined lapatinib and trastuzumab treatment. Further studies using PC-B-142CA as a model of drug resistance may be valuable for identification of better targeted molecules in HER2-positive breast cancer.As to the review of literature, the well-known HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines are the cells with HER2 gene overexpression and more aggressive phenotypes. In comparison to these existing cell lines, the newly established PC-B-142CA cell line exhibited BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. BRCA1 mutation at exon 10 (c.2612C>T) was found in PC-B-142CA (93%) cells and the BRCA2 mutation showed in exon 10 (c.12740C>G, 99%) and exon 17 (c.7806-14T>C, 100%). Commercial HER2-positive cell lines including AU565, HCC1569, HCC1954, HCC202, KPL-4, OCUB-F, SKBR3, SKBR5, SUM190PT, SUM225CWN and UACC893 cells have wild-type BRCA1. The breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are critically involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and drug resistance in cancer treatment. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations showed an association with the development of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. The BRCA1/2-mutated PC-B-142CA cells can be used in the area of breast cancer research for insight into the effect of BRCA aberration in breast cancer progression.Moreover, ERBB2 amplification was found in HER2-positive PC-B-142CA cells which may be related to drug resistance of anastrozole, anthracycline, capecitabine, docetaxel/trastuzumab, exemestane, fulvestrant, lapatinib, lapatinib/letrozole, lapatinib/trastuzumab, letrozole, neratinib, pertuzumab, pertuzumab/trastuzumab, tamoxifen and trastuzumab/emtansine; whereas PIK3CA mutation at exon 8 (c.1258T>C) is a pathogenic mutation correlated with alpelisib and combined alpelisib/fulvestrant resistance.In the PC-B-148CA cell line, the gain-of-function mutation of NRAS (G12C) leads to NRAS activation involving the RAS/RAF/MARK/PI3K pathway resulting in drug resistance. In addition, the loss-of-function mutations of BRCA2 (16%) and TP53 (100%) were found in PC-B-148CA cells, which is common in tumorigenesis. Loss of TP53 is common in advanced cancers; TP53 exon 6 single nucleotide variant mutant displays a relationship in promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival and EMT features. In comparison to TP53 mutations in MDA-MB-231 cells, over 90% of the mutations in TP53 in MDA-MB-231 were found at exons 8 (codon 280: Arg>Lys (R280K), that indicates the impact of mutant TP53 upon the tumorigenic properties of MDA-MB-231 cell by loss of cytoplasmic pro-apoptotic activity. There are no mutations of TP53 in MCF-7 cells.In conclusion, this study established two breast cancer cell lines from HER2-positive and TN breast cancer cell lines and characterized their tumorigenic phenotypes including cell growth, migration and DOX/PTX responses and targeted drug-related gene aberrations. PC-B-142CA cells can serve as a novel HER2-positive cell line for drug resistance and unravelling the effect of BRCA aberration in breast cancer progression, while PC-B-148CA is a novel TN cell line suitable for invasive and stemness-related properties. Further in vivo study on these two breast cancer cells, such as tumor biology, cellular and molecular carcinogenesis and drug response, are needed. Importantly, these novel breast cancer cell lines represent valuable tools in breast cancer research.Supplementary MaterialFundingThis study was funded by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (grant no.

Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

        "content": "A constitutive and dynamic interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma is a prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (collectively called cancer associated fibroblasts, CAFs) often represent the major cellular components of tumor stroma. Tumor cells secret different growth factors which induce CAFs proliferation and differentiation, and, consequently, CAFs secrete different chemokines, cytokines or growth factors which induce tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In this study we showed here that CAFs from breast cancer surgical specimens significantly induced the invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Most interestingly, the novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dovitinib significantly blocked the CAFs-induced invasion of breast cancer cells by, at least in part, inhibition of the expression and secretion of CCL2, CCL5 and VEGF in CAFs. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could be responsible for the effects of Dovitinib, since Dovitinib antagonized the promoted phosphorylated Akt after treatment with PDGF, FGF or breast cancer cell-conditioned media. Treatment with Dovitinib in combination with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors Ly294002 or RAD001 resulted in additive inhibition of cell invasion. This is the first in vitro study to show that the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor has therapeutic activities against breast cancer metastasis by targeting both tumor cells and CAFs. ",

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

Our data suggest that targeting PDGFR\u03b2 in the tumor stroma could have therapeutic value in patients with high tumor PDGF-BB expression.IntroductionThe last few decades have witnessed an explosive development of small molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases for targeted cancer therapy. It has also become clear that the tumor microenvironment, including infiltrating immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells and pericytes of the tumor vasculature, play important roles for tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.Induction of angiogenesis is a pivotal step in progression of solid tumors and therefore targeted therapy against the vascular compartment is an attractive strategy in anti-cancer treatment. Pericytes are smooth muscle-like cells, which are closely wrapped around capillary endothelial cells and have a key role in vascular development, stabilization, maturation and remodeling. The function and homeostasis of pericytes are regulated to a large extent by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF \u03b2-receptor (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling pathway. Mice genetically deficient of PDGF-B or PDGFR\u03b2 display abnormal development and maturation of the vascular tree due to inefficient recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells, which leads to lethality around the time of birth.PDGF is a family of mitogens that stimulate, for example, the division of smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts and glial cells in the brain. The PDGF isoforms (PDGF-AA, -BB, -AB, -CC and -DD) signal through activation of two structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases, PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2. The different receptors bind the ligands with different affinities. PDGFR\u03b1 binds preferentially PDGF-A, -B and -C, whereas PDGFR\u03b2 binds PDGF-B and -D. Activated PDGFR\u03b1 and \u03b2 subsequently trigger overlapping but also unique signaling outcomes.Under physiological conditions, PDGF signaling regulates embryonic development , wound healing, interstitial fluid pressure, and the integrity of the blood brain barrier. On the other hand, overactive PDGF signaling has been observed in certain pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis, various fibrotic conditions and malignancies . Autocrine PDGF-BB signaling promotes growth of the skin tumor dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), and mutations of PDGF receptors drive certain gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome and gliomas. Paracrine stimulations involving PDGF isoforms also play an important role in the development of stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts and promotion of tumor vascularization by stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes .The prototypical PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibitor, imatinib (also named Glivec/Gleevec or STI571), is an ATP-competitive agent which is used clinically for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), GIST, DFSP as well as other tumor types . In addition to targeting the activity of the PDGFRs, imatinib also inhibits the kinase activities of c-Kit, Abl/Bcr-Abl and CSF1R; other registered PDGFR kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib are even less selective. Overactive PDGF signaling has also been reported to be involved in various other tumor types and efforts have been made to target PDGFRs using imatinib, sorafenib or sunitinib among others. The multi-targeting characteristic of the available inhibitors, makes it difficult to uncover the specific importance of PDGFR\u03b2 in tumorigenesis, since the observed effects may be due to inhibition of other kinase targets.Selective targeting of host kinases can be elegantly achieved by analogue-sensitive kinase allele (ASKA) technology, where the wild-type kinase is replaced by a kinase that is mutated in the ATP-binding pocket so that it can be specifically inhibited by a compound (1-NaPP1) that interferes uniquely with the ASKA mutant and does not inhibit other kinases. Animals bearing this silent mutation carry an otherwise fully functional kinase . To determine the specific role of PDGFR\u03b2 in the tumor microenvironment, we have studied four tumor cell lines, with no or low PDGFR\u03b2 expression. These cell lines were grown in an ASKA mouse model with a mutant PDGFR\u03b2 kinase (Taconic Artemis). We have compared the effect of selective PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibition with the effects of the broader kinase inhibitor imatinib.Material and methodsPDGFR\u03b2 ASKA mice and animal experimentationPDGFR\u03b2 ASKA C57BL/6 mutant mice were kindly provided by Taconic Artemis and all animal experiments described were approved by the local committees for animal care and experimentation.Eight to twelve weeks old PDGFR\u03b2 ASKA mice received subcutaneous inoculation of 1\u00d7106 B16, B16/PDGF-BB or LLC cells in the left dorsal skinfold. EO771 metastatic breast cancer cells (5\u00d7105) were orthotopically injected into the 4th left mammary fat pad of female mice. When the tumors became palpable, the mice were randomized into different treatment groups to receive 150 \u03bcL oral gavage of either vehicle (sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) or imatinib (75, 150 or 250 mg/kg/day) for 10 days, or intraperitoneal injection (100 \u03bcL) of vehicle (5% ethanol, 70% PEG400, 25% saline) or 1-NaPP1 (15, 30 or 45 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. The tumors were measured using calipers, and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula \u03c0/6 \u00d7 length \u00d7 width \u00d7 width. All experiments were terminated whenever one of the experimental groups reached the ethically approved experimental endpoint of 1000 mm3 tumor volume or the day after treatment was finished. The mice were anesthetized with Avertin (Sigma) and perfused with 10 mL PBS followed by 10 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Tumors were harvested and kept in 30% sucrose for 24 h, embedded in OCT cryopreservation medium (Bio-Optica), or kept in 4% PFA followed by 70% ethanol for paraffin embedding. No animals were excluded from the analysis.FITC-lectin perfusion assayFITC-lectin perfusion was performed as described previously. The degree of perfusion was determined by the ratio FITC-lectin-positive area/CD31-positive area, analyzed automatically with CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), revealing the proportion of perfused vessels with functional blood flow.Isolation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from PDGFR\u03b2 ASKA micePregnant PDGFR\u03b2 ASKA mice were sacrificed at day 13 or 14 postcoitum by cervical dislocation and mouse embryonic fibroblasts was isolated as described elsewhere. After two days in culture, when the cells were 80-90% confluent, they were harvested, and frozen for future use.Cell cultureMEFs from both wild-type and ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mutants, as well as the 10T1/2 mouse embryonic cell line, MOVAS mouse smooth muscle cells, BJ foreskin human fibroblasts, Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell line, EO771 metastatic breast cancer cell line, B16 and B16/PDGF-BB melanoma cell lines, were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM; Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; 20% for EO771 cells), 100 units penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C. The medium used to culture the B16 and B16/PDGF-BB melanoma cell lines was supplemented with 150 \u03bcg/mL zeocine. PAE-PDGFR\u03b1 cells were cultured in F12 media (Sigma), supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. For serum starvation, all cells were cultured overnight in medium containing 0.1% FBS.PDGFR\u03b2+ cell isolationLLC and B16/BB tumors from all three treated experimental groups (vehicle, 1-NaPP1, imatinib) were excised and minced, following heart perfusion with PBS and PFA. The tissue was then digested for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0C with constant stirring with collagenase A (Roche), Hyaluronidase (Sigma), and DNase I (Invitrogen) dissolved in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco/Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1% BSA. PDGFR\u03b2+ cells were isolated by overnight incubation with magnetic beads coated with biotinylated PDGFR\u03b2 antibodies (BD Biosciences). RNA extraction was then performed of the isolated population and the purity of the fraction was analyzed by quantitative PCR.Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted from B16, EO771 and LLC cells with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). One \u03bcg (or 500 ng) of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using IScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) to create cDNA templates. Quantitative PCR was performed using KAPA SYBR Fast qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) in triplicates by the CFX96 system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression levels of Pdgf-b and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (Cspg4), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (Xiap) and vascular endothelial growth factor-a (Vegf-a) were quantified by using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 as housekeeping reference genes, respectively. The primer sequences for Cspg4, Xiap and Vegf-a are shown in Table S1, whereas the primers for L19, Gapdh and Pdgf-b have been reported previously.ImmunostainingTwelve \u03bcm cryosections were fixed with ice-cold acetone, methanol or 4% PFA. After blocking with serum-free protein block (Dako) or 5% donkey serum in PBS for 90 min at room temperature, the sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified dark chamber with primary antibodies (shown in Table S2) in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Samples were then washed three times with PBS-1% BSA, incubated with appropriate Alexa conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) for >1 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA, and finally mounted in Vectashield DAPI-containing mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).Image analysisImaging was performed using an Axio Imager M2 (Zeiss) with an AxioCam MRm digital camera and the ZEN 2012 software. Vascular parameters were measured using the AngioTool software, which can be used to determine morphological and spatial parameters, such as the overall size of the vascular network, the total and average vessel length, and vessel junctional density. Quantification of pericyte coverage, vessel perfusion and vessel apoptosis was performed using the open-source CellProfiler software version 2.2.0 [http://www.cellprofiler.org; [31]].ImmunoblottingSubconfluent cells were starved overnight and then stimulated for different time periods with 20 ng/mL PDGF-BB. In case of treatment with inhibitors, the cells were incubated for the indicated times with either vehicle (dimethyl sulphoxide; DMSO) or the inhibitors mentioned in Table S3, 1 h prior to stimulation with PDGF-BB. The stimulation was stopped by washing cells twice in ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described elsewhere. The antibodies used for immunoblotting are described in Table S2.Liquid nitrogen frozen tumors from mice treated with vehicle, imatinib or 1-NaPP1 were grinded with mortar and pestle, and tumor lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), supplemented with 100x Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher), 1 mM Pefa Block, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM EDTA. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16000 x g for 30 minutes at 4oC, supernatants were collected and protein concentration was measured by using BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Incubation with agarose bound WGA beads (Vector Laboratories) was performed overnight, followed by three washing steps with lysis buffer. Retained proteins were desorbed by boiling for 5 minutes in SDS sample buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting, as described elsewhere.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism version 7.0. The statistical significance of differences among mean values was determined by one-way ANOVA analysis and two-tailed t-test; *, p <0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. All the sample sizes were tested for normality and were appropriate for assumption of normal distribution and variance was similar between the groups. In one case, in which the sample size was tested negative for normality, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were performed (Figure 2SI). In vitro analyses were repeated at least three times.ResultsThe ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity is inhibited by both 1-NaPP1 and imatinibIn the present study, we made use of a PDGFR\u03b2 kinase switch mouse model (Taconic Artemis). This model consists of a mouse line carrying a threonine to alanine point mutation at codon 680 in the ATP-binding pocket of PDGFR\u03b2. Receptors harboring this mutation show specific inhibition of the PDGFR\u03b2 kinase upon administration of a specific compound, 1-NaPP1 (Figure 1A).To confirm that the PDGFR\u03b2 kinase is functional in this mouse model and to investigate whether it could be inhibited by 1-NaPP1 and other PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibitors, we isolated MEFs from ASKA and wild-type littermate mice for in vitro analysis. PDGF-BB stimulation induced PDGFR\u03b2 autophosphorylation in both wild-type and ASKA mutant MEFs to the same extent. PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2 in wild-type MEFs was not affected by treatment with 1-NaPP1, while it was inhibited in ASKA mutant MEFs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). Furthermore, 1-NaPP1 was found not to inhibit PDGFR\u03b1 in porcine aortic endothelial cells (Figure S1A). Imatinib inhibited the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2 in both wild-type and ASKA MEFs (Figure 1C).Since 1-NaPP1 selectively inhibited the kinase activity of ASKA PDGFR\u03b2, the ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mutant mouse model represents a useful tool to dissect the impact of exclusively targeting PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity.Selective inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 inhibits growth of LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumorsOverexpression of PDGF-BB in tumor cells has been shown to generate increased pericyte coverage in solid tumors, resulting in better vessel perfusion and increased tumor growth. High tumor PDGF-BB expression has been shown to be associated with increased angiogenesis and to correlate with decreased patient survival. We compared tumor cells expressing high levels of PDGF-BB, such as Lewis Lung carcinoma cells (Figure S1B and S1F) and B16 melanoma cells stably transfected with PDGF-BB (Figure S1C), with tumors with low PDGF-BB content (B16 melanoma and EO771; Figure S1D-F). Previous studies have reported that LLC and B16 cell lines do not express PDGFR\u03b2; by immunoblotting of lysates of cultured cells we found low (B16, B16/PDGF-BB, EO771) or no (LLC) expression of PDGFR\u03b2 on these cells (Figure S1G). Additionally, all tumor models are syngeneic to C57BL/6 background, the same genetic background as the ASKA mutant mice; tumor cells were grown subcutaneously in the ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mice, apart from EO771 that was orthotopically injected into the 4th mammary fat pad.To identify the 1-NaPP1 dose that efficiently inhibits PDGFR\u03b2 signaling, we tested three different doses, one that should keep detectable levels of 1-NaPP1 in the mouse circulation for 24 h, i.e. 30 mg/kg of body weight (data not shown, Taconic Artemis communication), as well as a lower (15 mg/kg) and a higher (45 mg/kg) dose. After 10 days of treatment, both doses of 30 and 45 mg/kg had caused significant tumor growth impairment (p<0.001) with the most efficient inhibition of tumor progression by 30 mg/kg, while the lowest dose provided no therapeutic benefit (Figure 2A).In most animal studies with imatinib, a standard dosage of 150 mg/kg body weight per day is used. In order to determine the optimal dose for ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mutant mice with LLC tumors, we investigated in addition to the 150 mg/kg, also 75 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg per day. This dose-response analysis revealed that 150 mg/kg/day gave a small but not significant reduction in LLC tumor growth, whereas doses of 75 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg had no effect on tumor growth (Figure 2B). Based on these results we selected daily doses of 30 mg/kg for 1-NaPP1 and 150 mg/kg for imatinib for all subsequent experiments.We next investigated the effect of specifically inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity using 1-NaPP1, in comparison with the less selective kinase inhibitor imatinib. After 10 days of daily treatment, 1-NaPP1 suppressed growth of LLC tumors in the ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mutant mouse model (Figure 2C) compared to vehicle-treated tumors (p<0.001), while imatinib did not exhibit any appreciable therapeutic benefit. Strikingly, the growth tumors expressing low amounts of PDGF-BB, such as B16 melanoma and EO771 breast cancer tumors, were not affected by treatment with 1-NaPP1 or imatinib (Figure S2A-B). Given these observations, we further investigated the possibility that targeting PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity only renders therapeutic benefit in the presence of enhanced PDGF-BB/PDGFR\u03b2 signaling. Similarly, to the LLC tumors, 10 daily treatments of the PDGF-BB overexpressing tumor model B16/PDGF-BB with 1-NaPP1 unveiled a decreased tumor growth rate (p<0.001) in the ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mutant mouse model, whereas imatinib gave no effect (Figure 2D). To confirm that the kinase activity of PDGFR\u03b2 was inhibited in vivo, we analyzed LLC tumor lysates from mice treated with vehicle, 1-NaPP1 or imatinib, by immunoblotting using an antibody against pTyr857; the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2 was suppressed in mice treated with either 1-NaPP1 or imatinib (Figure 2E).Thus, selective inhibition of host PDGFR\u03b2 in ASKA mice by 1-NaPP1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumor models that express high levels of PDGF-BB. Surprisingly, imatinib, which has a broader inhibitory profile, did not affect tumor growth in either of the tumor models studied.Selective inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 impairs tumor vascularization in LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumorsGiven the well-documented importance of PDGF-BB and PDGFR\u03b2 signaling for pericyte recruitment to the vasculature, we analyzed the effects of impairing PDGFR\u03b2 activity on the tumor vasculature. Vasculature was visualized by CD31 or podocalyxin immunostainings and vascular parameters, including vessel density, average vessel length and vessel branching, were measured using Angiotool, a software validated for studies on angiogenesis and vascular development. Immunostaining of LLC tumors for the endothelial marker podocalyxin showed that vessel density, vessel branching and number of vessel junctions, were significantly decreased (Figure 3A-B and 3D-E) by either 1-NaPP1 or imatinib. In contrast, the vascular lacunarity, i.e. the irregularity and the size of gaps between blood vessels, was significantly higher after treatment with 1-NaPP1 than imatinib (Figure 3F). Moreover, specific targeting with 1-NaPP1 elicited a much stronger effect on the vascular tree compared to imatinib, as a significant decrease in vessel length was observed compared to both vehicle- and imatinib- treated tumor vessels (Figure 3C). Analysis of several tumors revealed a positive correlation between tumor volume and vessel density (Figure S3A). Furthermore, similar analysis of the B16/PDGF-BB tumor vasculature with the widely used vascular markers CD31 (Figure 3G) and podocalyxin (data not shown) revealed an inhibitory effect of 1-NaPP1 on vessel density, length, branching and number of junctions as well as a significant increase in vascular lacunarity, thus corroborating the strong impact on the vasculature upon PDGFR\u03b2 signaling inhibition (Figure 3H-L). In contrast, the tumor vasculature (Figure S2C-H) was neither significantly affected by 1-NaPP1 nor by imatinib in B16 tumors having low expression of PDGF-BB, although a trend towards decreased vessel density was observed (Figure S2C-D).In conclusion, inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 signaling strongly affects the vascularization of LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumors, most likely through interfering with pericyte function and concomitant negative effects on the endothelium.Selective inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 impairs vascular function and increases vessel apoptosis in tumors with high PDGF-BB expressionSince selective targeting of PDGFR\u03b2 by 1-NaPP1 strongly affected tumor growth and vasculature leading to a significant decrease in vessel size in both LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumors, we studied the effect of 1-NaPP1 treatment on tumor vasculature perfusion. By injection of FITC-conjugated lectin upon treatment with 1-NaPP1, a significantly impaired vascular perfusion was seen, compared with both vehicle and imatinib-treated tumors (Figure 4A). As vessel size and perfusion were strongly affected in 1-NaPP1-treated LLC tumors, we further examined the possibility that endothelial cells undergo apoptosis in the presence of 1-NaPP1. Immunostaining for the vessel marker CD31 and the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 revealed a significant increase in apoptotic endothelial cells after 1-NaPP1 treatment, but not after treatment with vehicle or imatinib (Figure 4B). This observation suggests that selective PDGFR\u03b2 inhibition by 1-NaPP1 prevents tumor growth by inducing endothelial cell apoptosis. Analysis of several tumors showed positive and negative correlations between vessel perfusion and tumor volume (Figure S3B) and endothelial cell apoptosis (Figure S3C), respectively.Selective inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 differentially affects tumor pericyte populations depending on PDGF-BB levelsWe next evaluated the impact of inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity on the PDGFR\u03b2+ pericyte population. Targeting of PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity led to a significant decrease of PDGFR\u03b2+ pericyte coverage of tumor vessels in LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumors treated with either 1-NaPP1 or imatinib (Figure 5A and B). However, neither 1-NaPP1 nor imatinib influenced the \u03b1-SMA+ pericytes of LLC (Figure 5C) or B16/PDGF-BB tumors (Figure 5D), probably because this marker is most predominantly expressed in high caliber well established vessels, and therefore less sensitive to the inhibitors. In contrast, a significant reduction in NG2+ pericyte coverage of tumor vessels was seen in both LLC and B16/PDGF-BB tumors treated with 1-NaPP1 (Figure 5E-F). Treatment with imatinib also suppressed NG2+ pericyte coverage, but only in LLC tumors.B16 tumors, which comprise low PDGF-BB paracrine signaling, showed a trend towards decreased PDGFR\u03b2+ pericyte coverage of tumor vessels after treatment with 1-NaPP1 as well as imatinib, whereas no change was observed on NG2+ pericyte coverage (Figure S2I-J).To summarize, selective and unselective impairment of PDGFR\u03b2 kinase function rendered similar effects on the tumor pericyte populations in the ASKA PDGFR\u03b2 mutant mice, although in most cases stronger effects were observed upon selective PDGFR\u03b2 signaling inhibition. While \u03b1-SMA+ pericyte coverage seemed unaffected by either treatment, a reduction of PDGFR\u03b2+ pericytes was shown in the presence of either of the two PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibitors. Interestingly, upon PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibition the NG2+ pericyte coverage was substantially reduced, suggesting a role of PDGFR\u03b2 signaling in the regulation of NG2 expression.PDGF-BB induces expression of NG2 in pericyte precursor cellsTo further investigate the effects of 1-NaPP1 and imatinib on the expression of NG2, we employed PDGFR\u03b2 mutant ASKA MEFs. PDGF-BB stimulation of these cells promoted a substantial increase in NG2 protein levels, which was strongly blunted by 1-NaPP1 treatment, suggesting that PDGF-BB promotes NG2+ pericyte differentiation (Figure 6A).We further attempted to validate the effect of PDGF-BB on NG2 expression in MOVAS vascular smooth muscle cells, HBVP brain pericyte primary cells and the 10T1/2 pericyte precursor cell line. PDGF-BB only induced NG2 expression in the mesenchymal pericyte precursor cell line 10T1/2 (Figure 6B-C), suggesting that only mesenchymal precursor cells still retain the capacity to induce NG2 expression upon PDGF-BB stimulation. Using a panel of selective inhibitors that target different signaling pathways known to function downstream of PDGFR\u03b2, we found that NG2 expression in response to PDGF-BB stimulation was inhibited by the Mek1/2 inhibitor CI-1040 (Figure 6D-E), suggesting a role for Mek/Erk1/2 pathway in the regulation of PDGF-BB-induced NG2 expression.DiscussionThe aim of the present study was to dissect the effects of specific targeting of the PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity on tumor growth and vascularization. We studied cancer cell lines with no or low PDGFR\u03b2 expression, and used the ASKA mouse model, which provided an opportunity to elucidate the specific role(s) of PDGFR\u03b2 signaling in the host during tumor growth and explore the value of highly selective PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs.We found that specific inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 activity strongly reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in tumors with high PDGF-BB expression, while the less specific kinase inhibitor imatinib rendered negligible suppression of tumor growth even though it affected the vascularization of tumors. Indeed, it has previously been shown that imatinib monotherapy does not inhibit tumor growth in different tumor models, such as the B16/PDGF-BB melanoma, the human gastric carcinoma orthotopic nude mouse xenograft, the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor model and the human MA-11 breast carcinoma. Imatinib is used as first line therapy in CML and GIST, based on its ability to target Bcr-Abl, c-Kit and PDGFR\u03b2 expressed by the tumor cells. It has also been reported to be efficacious as monotherapy in a cervical mouse model of cancer by targeting PDGFR signaling and infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts.We found that tumors with high expression of PDGF-BB, i.e. LLC and B16/PDGF-BB, and hence elevated PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity, did respond to 1-NaPP1 treatment in the ASKA mutant mice, whereas low PDGF-BB expressing tumors, such as B16 and EO771 did not. A previous report on tumor response and PDGF-BB dose-dependency suggested that anti-PDGF drugs had an inhibitory effect on tumors with high PDGF-BB content. One possible explanation for the dose-dependency is that tumors become addicted to high PDGF-BB levels and therefore susceptible to PDGFR\u03b2 inhibition, similar to the well-established oncogene addiction. The levels of tumor PDGF-BB may thus serve as a biomarker for selection of cancer patients for anti-PDGF therapy.High PDGF-BB expression correlated with poor progression-free survival in a phase II clinical trial on patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with imatinib, consistent with our findings that imatinib does not provide therapeutic benefit in the high PDGF-BB expressing lung cancer model LLC. However, our finding that selective targeting of PDGFR\u03b2 in cancer models with high PDGF-BB expression did have a therapeutic effect, suggests that specific PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibitors may have a value in cancer therapy. The lack of therapeutic benefit of imatinib is counter intuitive, since it inhibits the activity of PDGFR\u03b2 as well as other kinases, hence one may have expected stronger anti-tumor effect by imatinib treatment. The exact reason for the limited effect by imatinib remains to be explained, but it is possible that imatinib simultaneously inhibits both tumor promoting and inhibiting pathways induced by different kinases. The observation that 1-NaPP1, but not imatinib, induced apoptosis is compatible with the possibility that imatinib, but not 1-NaPP1, inhibits pro-apoptotic or enhances anti-apoptotic pathways. A potential mechanism for the differential effects on tumor angiogenesis and growth may be related to the observation that while both 1-NaPP1 and imatinib reduced the Vegf-a expression in cell lines and tumor tissue, only imatinib treatment upregulated the anti-apoptotic gene Xiap that could possibly protect from apoptosis (Figure S4). This finding is in concurrence with studies showing that expression of XIAP is associated with imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia.Not much is known about the regulation of expression of different pericyte markers. Here we showed that PDGF-BB induced the expression of the pericyte marker NG2 in ASKA MEFs. Tumor pericyte markers are not mutually exclusive, and several different markers can be concomitantly expressed in the same pericyte. Interestingly, it has been shown that PDGFR\u03b2-positive progenitor cells from the bone marrow are able to differentiate into \u03b1-SMA- and NG2-positive pericytes during tumor angiogenesis. It is plausible that 1-NaPP1 directly inhibits bone marrow PDGFR\u03b2-positive progenitor cells, thereby preventing their differentiation into NG2-positive pericytes and PDGF-BB-induced pericyte recruitment to the tumor. Importantly, the induction of NG2 by PDGF-BB, or its suppression by PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibition, was only found in the ASKA MEFs and 10T1/2 cells, but not in differentiated perivascular cells such as human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) or the vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) (data not shown). One reason could be that the ASKA MEFs are still in a primary state maintaining mesenchymal precursor cell properties, while the other more differentiated cell lines are no longer prone to NG2 regulation in vitro.A previous study using the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor model Rip1Tag2 identified 3 populations of pericytes in pancreatic tumors based on expression of PDGFR\u03b2 and NG2: PDGFR\u03b2+ only, NG2+ only, and cells expressing both PDGFR\u03b2+ and NG2+. Although PDGFR\u03b2 and NG2 expression does not always overlap, our results suggest that there is a strong link between PDGFR\u03b2 signaling and NG2 expression. These observations further suggest that PDGFR\u03b2 signaling is involved in the regulation and maintenance of at least some NG2-positive pericyte populations. However, the \u03b1-SMA-positive pericytes neither responded to selective nor to unselective PDGFR\u03b2 inhibition, even if bone marrow PDGFR\u03b2+ progenitor cells have been shown to also differentiate into \u03b1-SMA-positive pericytes.The pericytes sustain important support functions for the endothelial cells by providing both physical protection and scaffolding to the vasculature, but also through intimate cellular crosstalk with the endothelial cells through paracrine signaling. Since we could not observe a direct effect of 1-NaPP1 or imatinib on the expression of PDGFRs or VEGFR2 in endothelial cells (data not shown), it is likely that the observed effect on the vasculature is due to interference with the crosstalk between PDGFR\u03b2 expressing pericytes, or other PDGFR\u03b2 expressing cells, and endothelial cells. In fact, pericytes are known to provide important survival cues to the endothelium. This notion is supported by our finding that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 kinase activity with 1-NaPP1 led to a significant decrease in pericyte coverage, and to a significant increase in endothelial cell apoptosis. This observation was further supported by the strong inhibitory effect of 1-NaPP1 on vessel density, size and perfusion, suggesting that specific PDGFR\u03b2 inhibition impairs tumor growth by inducing endothelial cell apoptosis, and thus decreasing blood vessel function. Although imatinib-treated tumors also demonstrated a significant decrease in vessel density, no change was observed either on vessel size, perfusion or endothelial cell apoptosis. In this context, it is of interest to note that imatinib has been shown to promote vessel normalization, modulate the extracellular matrix composition, increase vessel perfusion, and increase the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.Our data support the notion that selective targeting of host PDGFR\u03b2 gives a treatment benefit in preclinical tumor models with strong paracrine PDGF-BB stimulation. Therefore, it is possible that treatment with specific PDGFR\u03b2 kinase inhibitors preferentially is effective for cancers with high PDGF-BB expression. Thus, for use of selective PDGFR\u03b2 future kinase inhibitors for treatment of epithelial tumors, stratification of patients based on tumor PDGF-BB expression may be necessary.Supplementary

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs. In panel b, the first, second, and third columns show the distribution of NPs, lysosomes, and merged image of lysosomes, MTs, and NPs, respectivelyQuantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular retention of GNPPEG-RGD. a Quantitative data representing percent of retention of NPs. The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.

        "title": "Expression of the alpha-fetoprotein gene in human breast cancer.",
        "content": "Recently, evidence was obtained that the ability to take up alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP), which is characteristic of fetal cells, may be required both in vivo and in vitro by different types of human and animal tumor cells via expression of specific alpha-FP receptors. Mammary gland carcinomas belong to this class of tumor. In some neoplasms, expression of alpha-FP receptors is concomitant with activation of the alpha-FP gene and synthesis of the protein, suggesting that an autocrine alpha-FP/alpha-FP-receptor pathway is operational in these tumors. In the present work, 18 human breast cancer biopsy specimens were subjected to in situ hybridization with a human alpha-FP cDNA probe. Positive labeling for alpha-FP mRNA transcripts was seen in 8 of the specimens. Surprisingly, strong positive signals were seen in stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes infiltrating tumor nests and in adipocytes adjacent to tumor areas, while the malignant cells themselves were hardly labeled. This suggest paracrine stimulation of the alpha-FP gene, probably as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Pathological implications arise from the ability of alpha-FP to regulate growth, either alone or synergistically with other growth factors, as well as its ability to enhance fatty acid entry into proliferating cells.",

However, independent risk factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients have not been detailly elucidated. Previous data regarding the impact of HCV elimination by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) on glucose homeostasis is insufficient and controversial. This study aimed to analyze the independent factors associated with IR and to evaluate the changes in glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV-infected patients treated with DAAs therapies.MethodsWe screened 704 patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with interferon-free DAAs. Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics, biochemical and virological data were collected. The outcome measurements were their IR and \u03b2-cell function assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment.ResultsHigh IR (HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5) was observed in 35.1% of the patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2, treatment experience, elevated baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglyceride, as well as Fibrosis-4 score >3.25 were independently associated with high IR. In patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR), no significant change in mean HOMA-IR was observed from baseline to 12-weeks post-treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.128). We observed a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress from 121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6 \u00b1 93.0 (p = 0.015). Subgroup analysis revealed that SVR was associated with a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001), HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027), and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039).ConclusionsThere were several independent factors associated with IR in patients with chronic HCV infection, including obesity, treatment experience, high serum ALT and triglyceride levels, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis. After viral elimination by DAAs, we observed a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline high IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.IntroductionChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also associated with multiple extrahepatic complications that influence the clinical outcomes of patients. An important extrahepatic manifestation is abnormal glucose metabolism including insulin resistance (IR), \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (DM). A prospective study showed that patients with chronic HCV infection were more than 11 times as likely as those without HCV infection to develop diabetes. A meta-analysis revealed a 1.8-fold higher risk of type 2 DM in HCV-infected patients than in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive/HCV-negative patients. Additionally, glucose abnormalities can worsen hepatic outcomes in HCV-infected patients. IR promotes the progression of hepatic fibrosis. This may be due to the direct effect of insulin on the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells and secretion of extracellular matrix. Further, high glucose levels and hyperinsulinemia can lead to upregulation of connective growth factor that is involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. In HCV-related chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes and IR are independently associated with rapid progression of liver fibrosis and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the elevated rate of hepatic morbidity and mortality.The mechanisms underlying HCV-induced IR and DM are complex and poorly explained. The HCV genome is composed of structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS2-NS5B) genes. The complex effects of HCV core and nonstructural 5A (NS5A) proteins have been observed to play important roles in glucose metabolism. In normal circumstances, when insulin attaches to the hepatocyte receptor, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is phosphorylated and then causes activation of Akt. The activated Akt causes the translocation of glucose transporter-4 to the surface of the hepatocyte and facilitates glucose entry into the hepatocyte. Akt also induces the synthesis of glycogen and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The HCV core protein impairs insulin signaling via several post-receptor mechanisms, including the activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members and consequent decrease in IRS-1. The core protein also increases phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine rather than tyrosine in hepatocytes, again preventing the downstream activation of Akt. HCV NS5A upregulates protein phosphatase 2A and inactivates Akt, which reduces the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT2, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake in the hepatocytes, and thus, induces IR. Additionally, HCV protein increases oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, resulting in systemic effect including hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglycemia, and down-regulation of adiponectin. Epidemiological data suggest that all the major HCV genotypes lead to IR. Some viral-specific factors that influence glucose metabolism have also been discussed. Molecular evidence suggests that HCV core proteins in genotypes 3a and 1b promote IRS-1 degradation via different mechanisms. IR was clinically found to be associated with HCV genotype 1 and a high viral load, although the results were inconsistent.Elimination of HCV by interferon (IFN)-based regimen may perturb glucose homeostasis. Previous observational studies have shown that successful eradication of HCV improves IR in patients receiving IFN-based therapy. The \u03b2-cell hyperfunction is also ameliorated after antiviral treatment. Therefore, elimination or suppression of HCV can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, a few studies revealed no change in fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) after antiviral treatment. The results of these studies are inconsistent, but they indicate that the benefits of glucose metabolism may also be HCV genotype specific.Treatment has dramatically improved in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These modern drugs have extremely high treatment efficacy, safety, and less adverse events. These new medications have a higher rate of viral clearance than IFN-based therapy but lack the direct effect of IFN on glucose metabolism. Moreover, the impact of HCV clearance by DAAs on glucose abnormalities remains to be evaluated.Given the presumption that chronic HCV infection involves the development of IR, we hypothesized that HCV eradication by DAAs treatment could improve IR. The aim of the present study was to explore potential factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients and to assess the impact of HCV elimination on glucose homeostasis in patients who received DAAs therapies.MethodsStudy DesignThis was a single-center, observational study. Chronic HCV-infected patients with DAAs treatment were enrolled. Laboratory data including glucose parameters at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were measured. Several factors associated with baseline high IR were analyzed. Further, we calculated the dynamic changes in IR and \u03b2-cell secretion function in patients whose viruses were successfully eradicated. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study design was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mackay Memorial Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the study participants.PatientsWe enrolled patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with IFN-free DAAs therapy between January 2017 and July 2020. The inclusion criteria were patients (1) aged \u2265 20 years; (2) with detectable HCV viral load in the blood prior to treatment; (3) who agreed to receive laboratory testing at baseline, during antiviral treatment, and at 12 weeks after treatment; and (4) who provided informed consent. Patients were excluded if they: (1) missed regular clinical follow-ups after treatment; (2) had a medical history of DM or used glucose-lowering drugs; (3) died from other etiology during the study period; and (4) had concurrent conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus or HBV coinfection, Wilson\u2019s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Basic patient information, body mass index (BMI), HCV viral loads and genotype, alcohol consumption, and medical history were collected. Patients received different DAAs regimens, including asunaprevir + daclatasvir (2.5%), paritaprevir + ritonavir + ombitasvir + dasabuvir (7.8%), elbasvir + grazoprevir (10.7%), glecaprevir + pibrentasvir (16.6%), and sofosbuvir-based regimens (62.4%). Each patient received one of these DAAs regimens based on the HCV genotype, previous treatment status, presence of cirrhosis, current medications, and comorbidities.Laboratory ExaminationsInfection with chronic HCV was defined as persistent viremia for at least six months before treatment. Serum HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels were quantified using a Roche Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, in which the lowest level of detection was 15 IU/mL. HCV genotyping was performed using primer-specific PCR and direct PCR deep sequencing with an ABI 3730 sequencer. The sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA levels 12 weeks following treatment cessation. Information on the levels of fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, alpha-fetoprotein, white blood cells (WBC), as well as hemoglobin and platelets at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were collected. We used Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index as the non-invasive measurement for hepatic fibrosis. The FIB-4 index was calculated using the following formula: (AST [IU/L] \u00d7 age [years])/(platelet count [109/L] \u00d7 ALT [IU/L]1/2).The glucose homeostasis was assessed by the HOMA method. The formulas for the HOMA model are as follows: HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mg/dL) \u00d7 fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL)/405; HOMA-\u03b2 = fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL) \u00d7 360/(fasting glucose [mg/dL]\u201363). We dichotomized patients at a cutoff point of HOMA-IR 2.5 and analyzed factors associated with IR.Statistical AnalysisCategorical data are presented as numbers (percentages) and continuous variables are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance of the difference between categorical variables was determined using the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test depending on the sample size; continuous variables were compared using Student\u2019s t-test. For continuous variables with wide distribution, we presented data as median (interquartile range) and applied the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the differences. After univariate analysis, we performed multivariable logistic regression modelling to identify factors that were independently associated with baseline high IR. To compare quantitative glucose parameters between baseline and post-treatment, we performed Paired t-test. All statistical analyses were defined as two-sided hypotheses with a significance level defined at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsBaseline CharacteristicsDuring the study period, 704 patients were treated with IFN-free DAAs. We excluded 192 patients with medical history of DM or who used glucose-lowering drugs. Additionally, 65 patients were excluded from the study due to failure of checking insulin levels at either baseline or follow-up (n=34), missing regular follow-up (n=24), and death during treatment (n=7). Finally, we enrolled 447 patients in the study. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, glucose parameters, DAAs regimens, and treatment responses are shown in  Table\u00a01 . The patients were predominantly women (52.8%), with a mean BMI of 25.5 \u00b1 4.5 kg/m2, which was in the upper range of normal weight. The most frequent HCV genotype was genotype 1 (53.7%), followed by genotype 2 (35.1%). The prevalence of high viral loads (> 80 \u00d7 104 IU/mL) was 67.3%.

Univariate analysis ( Table\u00a02 ) showed that several factors were significantly associated with high IR, including indigenous race, high BMI (> 25 kg/m2), alcoholism, baseline elevated levels of ALT, alpha-fetoprotein, and triglyceride, as well as hepatic fibrosis (defined as FIB-4 > 3.25). The association between IR and older age was not significant (p=0.073). For virus-specific parameters, HCV genotype 1 and HCV treatment experience were significantly associated with high IR (both p < 0.01). The baseline HCV viral load did not influence IR in our patients (p=0.953). Baseline bilirubin, creatinine, uric acid, WBC counts, hemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were not significantly associated with baseline high IR.Univariate analysis of baseline factors associated with HOMA-IR.Factors \tHOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (n = 157)\tHOMA-IR < 2.5 (n = 290)\tp value\t \tMale gender\t68 (43.3)\t89 (56.7)\t0.225\t \tAge (mean \u00b1 SD)\t61.6 \u00b1 12.2\t59.3 \u00b1 13.5\t0.073\t \tIndigenous race\t59 (37.6)\t82 (28.3)\t0.043\t \tBMI (kg/m2, mean \u00b1 SD)\t28.6 \u00b1 5.0\t24.3 \u00b1 3.7\t0.000\t \tBMI > 25\t102 (65.8)\t106 (37.2)\t0.000\t \tAlcoholism\t18 (11.5)\t16 (5.5)\t0.024\t \tBaseline HCV viral load > 80 x 104 IU/mL\t106 (67.5)\t195 (67.2)\t0.953\t \tHCV genotype 1\t99 (63.1)\t141 (48.6)\t0.003\t \tTreatment experience\t27 (17.2)\t18 (6.2)\t0.000\t \taALT (IU/L, median (IQR))\t60.0 (64.5)\t39.5 (56.0)\t0.000\t \taAlpha-fetoprotein (ng/mL, median (IQR))\t5.2 (7.5)\t3.2 (3.0)\t0.000\t \tTriglyceride (mg/dL, mean \u00b1 SD)\t113.6 \u00b1 72.6\t90.6 \u00b1 45.6\t0.000\t \tCholesterol (mg/dL, mean \u00b1 SD)\t168.8 \u00b1 37.1\t173.2 \u00b1 34.8\t0.261\t \tWBC (103/\u00b5L, mean \u00b1 SD)\t5586 \u00b1 1660\t5422 \u00b1 1620\t0.312\t \tFIB-4 > 3.25\t63 (40.1)\t67 (23.1)\t0.000\t \tCategorical data are presented as number (percentage).These continuous variables showed wide distribution.

To analyze the relationship between viral elimination and changes in glucose parameters, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 were considered as continuous variables ( Table\u00a04 ). HOMA-IR did not change significantly from baseline to 12-weeks after treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p = 0.128). There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress (121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6\u00a0\u00b1 93.0, p = 0.015). In patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, we observed a significant improvement in mean IR (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001). Additionally, the subgroup analysis revealed that a statistically significant reduction in mean IR after DAAs therapies was observed in patients with HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027) and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039) ( Figure\u00a01 ). However, in patients with baseline HOMA-IR < 2.5, there was a significant increase in mean IR after HCV eradication. We also analyzed pre- and post-treatment HOMA-IR in patients with different races, BMI, HCV viral loads, baseline laboratory results, and FIB-4 score. There was no significant difference in HOMA-IR between values at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment.The change of glucose parameters among patients with SVR.Patients\tHOMA-IR \tHOMA-\u03b2\t \tBaseline \tPost-treatment\tp value\tBaseline \tPost-treatment\tp value\t \tTotal patients (n = 438)\t2.74 \u00b1 2.78\t2.54 \u00b1 2.20\t0.128\t121.0 \u00b1 110.1\t107.6 \u00b1 93.0\t0.015\t \tBaseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (n = 153)\t5.31 \u00b1 3.39\t3.68 \u00b1 2.57\t0.000\t190.5 \u00b1 127.6\t141.5 \u00b1 116.1\t0.000\t \t< 2.5 (n = 285)\t1.36 \u00b1 0.59\t1.93 \u00b1 1.69\t0.000\t83.7 \u00b1 77.0\t89.3 \u00b1 71.6\t0.306\t \tBMI > 25 (n = 204)\t3.49 \u00b1 3.45\t3.20 \u00b1 2.48\t0.205\t153.7 \u00b1 136.2\t133.2 \u00b1 104.3\t0.049\t \tBMI < 25 (n = 227)\t2.06 \u00b1 1.77\t1.96 \u00b1 1.72\t0.445\t92.0 \u00b1 68.3\t85.0 \u00b1 74.9\t0.168\t \tHCV genotype 1 (n = 236)\t3.05 \u00b1 3.11\t2.62 \u00b1 2.05\t0.027\t121.2 \u00b1 112.8\t105.8 \u00b1 89.6\t0.045\t \tGenotype non-1 (n = 202)\t2.37 \u00b1 2.31\t2.44 \u00b1 2.37\t0.684\t120.7 \u00b1 107.2\t109.6 \u00b1 96.9\t0.163\t \tTreatment experience (n = 41)\t4.00 \u00b1 3.37\t3.01 \u00b1 2.49\t0.039\t161.5 \u00b1 133.7\t152.9 \u00b1 178.9\t0.761\t \tTreatment na\u00efve (n = 397)\t2.61 \u00b1 2.69\t2.48 \u00b1 2.17\t0.371\t116.8 \u00b1 106.7\t102.9 \u00b1 77.9\t0.010\t \tBaseline high ALT (n = 219)\t3.29 \u00b1 3.31\t2.89 \u00b1 2.41\t0.064\t130.0 \u00b1 112.5\t121.7 \u00b1 112.2\t0.336\t \tBaseline high triglyceride (n = 219)\t3.24 \u00b1 3.10\t2.86 \u00b1 2.20\t0.056\t137.1 \u00b1 119.2\t115.2 \u00b1 83.4\t0.006\t \tFIB-4 > 3.25 (n = 125)\t3.79 \u00b1 4.08\t3.27 \u00b1 2.94\t0.137\t139.3 \u00b1 123.1\t123.9 \u00b1 122.6\t0.210\t \tFIB-4 < 3.25 (n = 313)\t2.32 \u00b1 1.91\t2.25 \u00b1 1.75\t0.554\t113.7 \u00b1 103.8\t101.0 \u00b1 77.3\t0.035\t \tALT, alanine aminotransferase; BMI, Body mass index; FIB-4, Fibrosis-4; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HOMA, homeostasis model assessment; IR, insulin resistance; SVR, sustained virological response.The bold fonts means a p value less than 0.05.The change of insulin resistance (IR) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR at baseline and 12-weeks after antiviral treatment were measured. In general, there was no significant change in mean HOMA-IR. In subgroup analysis, IR significantly reduced after antiviral treatment in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.DiscussionWe presented an observational analysis of glucose homeostasis in patients with chronic HCV infection and the outcomes of HCV elimination by DAAs therapy. We identified several factors contributing to IR in non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV infection. Obesity, elevated ALT and triglyceride levels, treatment experience, and advanced fibrosis were independently associated with IR. Obesity and metabolic syndrome were generally validated as risk factors for IR. In our result, serum levels of triglyceride, a well-known predictor of type 2 diabetes, were also independently related to IR. HCV NS5A and core proteins are known to directly inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity. The accumulation of hepatic triglycerides reduces insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis, consequently leading to hepatic and peripheral IR. We did not observe any virus-specific effects of IR. Neither HCV genotype nor viral loads were observed to be independent factors for HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5. At the molecular level, the core protein of genotype 3a promotes degradation of IRS-1 via downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) and upregulation of SOCS-7; and the core protein of genotype 1b interferes with the insulin signaling by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin. Previous studies have investigated the association of HCV genotype 1 with IR, but the results were inconsistent. In the present study, we also observed a higher prevalence of IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the statistical power was attenuated in multivariable logistic regression analysis. This could be because that the genotype-specific mechanisms interfering with the insulin signaling pathway only partially influenced systemic IR. The established risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia, remain the major contributors of IR in HCV-infected patients.The multivariable logistic regression analysis in the present study demonstrated that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with IR. These findings were less discussed in previous articles. As explained earlier, the HCV core protein and NS5A have complex effects on the insulin signaling pathway, influence hepatic and systemic glucose homeostasis, and thus, induce IR. We hypothesized that prolonged inflammation resulting from chronic HCV infection is associated with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. A previous history of treatment with IFN-based therapy may imply a longer duration of infection with HCV. Additionally, hepatic fibrosis indirectly supports the probability of a longer inflammation by HCV infection. In HCV-infected liver, inflammation is a key process to drive the fibrogenic response. The immune system secretes proinflammatory cytokines and profibrogenic factors, leading to hepatocellular injury, production of extracellular matrix, proliferation of myofibroblasts, and stimulation of fibrosis. Our finding revealed an association between hepatic fibrosis and IR. It is noteworthy that our result only supported a correlation, not a causal relationship. Advanced liver fibrosis may impair insulin clearance, resulting in elevated serum insulin levels. On the contrary, IR also contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis. The mechanism could be a direct stimulation of liver stellate cells by hyperinsulinemia, resulting in increased production of the connective tissue growth factor and subsequent accumulation of extracellular matrix.We analyzed the outcome of glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs. There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell stress. As mentioned earlier, levels of hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 decrease in HCV-infected patients. Clearance of HCV is accompanied by normalization of hepatic expression of IRS and improved \u03b2-cell function, which then influences glucose homeostasis. The IR remained statistically unchanged after DAAs therapy. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies that observed no difference in HOMA-IR between baseline and post-treatment phases in patients with HCV who underwent treatment. However, this contradicts the hypothesis that IR may be improved after HCV eradication, especially as HCV infection is a risk factor for the development of diabetes. There may be several explanations for the lack of an association between SVR and improvement of IR. The development of IR in HCV-infected patients could be a combination of both host- and virus-mediated pathways. The complex hepatic and non-hepatic mechanisms affecting glucose homeostasis may lead to heterogeneous post-SVR outcomes regarding IR. We performed subgroup analysis for further elucidation of the possible causal relationship. We observed a significant improvement in IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, which indirectly supports that HCV is an important contributor to IR, especially among patients with high-IR status. Additionally, this high-IR status could be reversed after HCV elimination by DAAs. Our subgroup analysis suggested that elimination of HCV genotype 1 was also associated with reduced IR. This relationship was not observed in patients with other genotypes. The result is consistent with previous research, which showed that successful viral clearance was found to be associated with reduced HOMA-IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. The genotype-specific outcome of IR suggested the direct viral effect as an important contributor to glucose abnormalities. In our result, advanced hepatic fibrosis was independently associated with IR. However, we did not observe a significant improvement in IR after HCV eradication in patients with advanced fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a chronic process. Patients who received DAA therapy could have a rapid decrease in inflammation rather than regression of fibrosis. The duration of our study seemed too short for significant hepatocyte remodeling or IR improvement.As discussed above, patients with chronic HCV infection show an increased risk of IR and progression to type 2 DM. There are no definite virus-specific factors associated with the increasing prevalence of IR. Thus, we suggest that all patients with HCV infection be screened for glucose abnormalities. It will help physicians to identify patients who have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and may require active surveillance, as diabetes can also increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the advent of DAAs, we may be able to eradicate HCV with greater certainty and a lower risk of adverse effects. An SVR is generally associated with normalization of liver enzymes, improvement in liver function, as well as regression of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Compared with untreated patients, patients whose HCV was eliminated by DAAs have a significantly lower risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, after successful virus elimination by treatment with DAAs, improvement in IR can be an additional benefit and may reduce diabetes-related morbidities. A prospective study found that HCV eradication by DAAs reduces the incidence of type 2 DM. However, a general worsening of the lipid profile after DAAs was observed. The impact of the balance between improved glucose metabolism and negative changes in lipid profile on the outcome of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk must be determined. A significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events has recently been observed following HCV clearance by DAAs. Further research is required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.This study has some limitations. First, this was an observational, open-label study and had the potential for selection bias. Second, a majority of the patients (98.0%) achieved SVR; therefore, it was impossible to compare glucose outcomes between patients with successful eradication and those with treatment failure. Third, the short-term study failed to demonstrate an improvement in IR; thus, the long-term outcome should be investigated to understand the effect of virus elimination on glucose homeostasis. Finally, we could not clarify the impact of HCV infection duration on IR, and could only demonstrate that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were associated with IR.In conclusion, we showed that obesity, treatment experience, baseline elevated levels of ALT and triglyceride, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with high IR in chronic HCV-infected patients. The prevalence of IR was not influenced by HCV genotypes and viral load. This study provided evidence that HCV-related IR could be partially reversed by HCV eradication, especially in patients with high baseline IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience. Further research for long-term outcomes of glucose homeostasis and diabetes-related morbidities in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs is required.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Mackay Memorial Hospital.

Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a multi-step mechanism. By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4<sup+</supCD25<sup+</sup T lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and\u00a0JAM2. Moreover, CAF-S1 increases T lymphocyte survival and promotes their differentiation into CD25<supHigh</supFOXP3<supHigh</sup, through B7H3, CD73, and DPP4. Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T\u00a0cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation.

        "content": "Bone metastasis is a frequent complication of advanced breast cancer. On the basis of functional and molecular evidence, signaling mediated by the binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and -DD to PDGF receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) is critical for the survival and growth of metastatic breast cancer cells within the bone microenvironment. In this study, we propose a new approach to blocking PDGFR\u03b2 signaling using soluble PDGFR\u03b2 (sPDGFR\u03b2) as a decoy receptor for PDGF-BB and -DD secreted from tumor cells and bone marrow stromal cells. A bone-seeking TNBCT/Bo cell line was established by in vivo selection from TNBCT human breast cancer cells, which are negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein expression. The TNBCT/Bo cells were transfected with a mammalian expression vector encoding the extracellular domain of PDGFR\u03b2. A stable transfectant (TNBCT/Bo-sPDGFR\u03b2) grew at a similar rate to that of control cells under normal culture conditions, although growth stimulation of human fibroblasts with PDGF-BB was neutralized by the culture medium from TNBCT/Bo-sPDGFR\u03b2 cells. Intratibial injection of TNBCT/Bo-sPDGFR\u03b2 cells into athymic nude mice resulted in a significant decrease in tumor incidence compared with control mice (P &lt; 0.01). This attenuated growth correlated with decreased cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and recruitment of stromal cells, and with an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. These findings suggest that sPDGFR\u03b2 is useful for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis.",

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

        "title": "Hepatocellular carcinoma cells cause different responses in expressions of cancer-promoting genes in different cancer-associated fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) is one of the most crucial components of the tumor microenvironment to promote the invasiveness of cancer cells. The interactions between cancer cells and CAFs are bidirectional. Our recent study showed that up-regulations of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 (CCL26), interleukin 6 (IL6), and lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) genes in cancer cells were parts of the common effects of CAFs on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to promote proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. However, the subject of how HCC cells to influence the gene expressions of CAFs still needs to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to investigate this issue. Two human HCC (HCC24/KMUH, HCC38/KMUH) and two human CAF cell lines (F26/KMUH, F28/KMUH) were studied. Influence of HCC38/KMUH cancer cells on differential expressions of genes in F28/KMUH CAFs was detected by microarray to select target genes for further analysis. Both HCC cell lines increased proliferation (all p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.005) and migration (all p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001) of two CAF cell lines. HCC24/KMUH cancer cells had stronger ability to promote migration of F26/KMUH CAFs than HCC38/KMUH cancer cells did (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001). Eleven up-regulated cancer-promoting genes, including apelin (APLN), CCL2, CCL26, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), IL6, mucin 1 (MUC1), LOXL2, platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide (PDGFA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) detected by microarray showed good correlation with results of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction study. Among these genes, HCC24/KMUH cancer cells had same tendency of effects on differential expressions of genes in F28/KMUH CAFs as HCC38/KMUH cancer cells did. However, the responses of F26/KMUH CAFs to different HCC cell lines were variable. Only PGK1 gene was consistently up-regulated and PDGFA gene was consistently down-regulated caused by both HCC cell lines in F26/KMUH CAFs. Besides PGK1 gene, HCC38/KMUH cancer cells only up-regulated APLN, LOXL2, and VEGFA genes and HCC24/KMUH cancer cells only up-regulated FGF2 gene in F26/KMUH CAFs. In conclusion, HCC cells can promote proliferation and migration of CAFs. However, the impact of HCC cells on differential expressions of cancer-promoting genes in CAFs is influenced by the characteristics of CAFs. This implies that blocking single or several particular cancer-promoting genes in CAFs is unable to become a common stratagem for the treatment of HCC.",

        "content": "Suramin, a non-specific growth factor antagonist, is currently under investigation for treatment of cancer patients. We studied its action on 6 different human breast-cancer cell lines in vitro. In complete growth medium, pleiotropic effects were observed with respect to cell proliferation, i.e. suramin is stimulatory at low concentrations and inhibitory at higher concentrations, for 4 of the 6 cell lines studied. The various cell lines showed marked differences with respect to the antiproliferative action of suramin, the Evsa-T cells being by far the most sensitive ones. A suramin concentration of 100 micrograms/ml brought about a 100% stimulation of the proliferation of ZR/HERc cells, ZR 75.1 cells ectopically expressing a human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) cDNA. Although less pronounced (10 to 60% stimulation), a similar response was observed for the parent ZR 75.1 cells, as well as for T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells. The non-specificity of the action of suramin was established by the observation that suramin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation could be abolished by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and even by estradiol, both in complete growth medium and under defined serum-free conditions. Our data indicate that suramin exerts pleiotropic effects on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro, and confirm the non-specific nature of its action. The stimulatory effect of low concentrations of suramin on the proliferation of breast cancer cells may have important consequences for breast cancer patients treated with suramin.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in regulating cancer progression. They promote tumor growth, metastasis formation, and induce drug resistance. For these reasons, they are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. Here, with the aim of developing CAF-targeted drug delivery agents, we functionalized H-ferritin (HFn) nanocages with fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibody fragments. Functionalized nanocages (HFn-FAP) have significantly higher binding with FAP<sup+</sup CAFs than with FAP<sup-</sup cancer cells. We loaded HFn-FAP with navitoclax (Nav), an experimental Bcl-2 inhibitor pro-apoptotic drug, whose clinical development is limited by its strong hydrophobicity and toxicity. We showed that Nav is efficiently loaded into HFn (HNav), maintaining its mechanism of action. Incubating Nav-loaded functionalized nanocages (HNav-FAP) with FAP<sup+</sup cells, we found significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to non-functionalized HNav. This was correlated with a significantly higher drug release only in FAP<sup+</sup cells, confirming the specific targeting ability of functionalized HFn.

They promote tumor growth, metastasis formation, and induce drug resistance. For these reasons, they are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. Here, with the aim of developing CAF-targeted drug delivery agents, we functionalized H-ferritin (HFn) nanocages with fibroblast activation protein (FAP) antibody fragments. Functionalized nanocages (HFn-FAP) have significantly higher binding with FAP+ CAFs than with FAP\u2212 cancer cells. We loaded HFn-FAP with navitoclax (Nav), an experimental Bcl-2 inhibitor pro-apoptotic drug, whose clinical development is limited by its strong hydrophobicity and toxicity. We showed that Nav is efficiently loaded into HFn (HNav), maintaining its mechanism of action. Incubating Nav-loaded functionalized nanocages (HNav-FAP) with FAP+ cells, we found significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to non-functionalized HNav. This was correlated with a significantly higher drug release only in FAP+ cells, confirming the specific targeting ability of functionalized HFn. Finally, we showed that HFn-FAP is able to reach the tumor and to target CAFs in a mouse syngeneic model of triple negative breast cancer after intravenous administration. Our data show that HNav-FAP could be a promising tool to enhance specific drug delivery into CAFs, thus opening new therapeutic possibilities focused on tumor microenvironment.1. IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

F Biodistribution of the DID-labeled liposomes in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at different time points after intravenous injection. G Ex vivo imaging of dissected tumors 24\u00a0h after injection of C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD, respectively. H Semi-quantitative ROI values of mean fluorescence intensity at tumor sites. **p\u2009<\u20090.01; Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of three technical replicates; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01C, D, the glycosyls of Rg3 at the C3-position were oriented towards the water molecules and sticked out of the surface of the liposomal membrane, which could potentially interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

All animals were treated according to the Guide for the Care and Laboratory Animals and all experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Fudan University (certificate number: 2020-04-YJ-WJX-01).Preparation and characterization of liposomesThe formulation in which PL-100\u00a0M/ Rg3 (or cholesterol)/docetaxel dissolved at the weight ratio of 10:3:1 in the organic solution (chloroform: ethanol 1:1) was prepared. The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484). Then, a larger mixed bilayer system consisting of 300 DSPC and 90 Rg3 molecules was generated with memgen tool. a total of 300\u00a0ns simulation was conducted for the system. The CHARMM36 force field was applied through MD simulations,. NPT ensemble was applied for the simulation with the Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat to keep the temperature at 300\u00a0K and the Parrinello\u2013Rhaman method to maintain a constant pressure of 1\u00a0atm. LINCS algorithm was applied for the constraint of H-bonds lengths. Partical-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was utilized to calculate the long-rang electrostatic interactions with PME grid of 0.12\u00a0nm in the reciprocal-apace interactions and cubic interpolation. The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score. The optimal docking conformation was determined based on the docking score and hydrogen bonding interactions. PyMol was utilized to generate the ribbon/surface view of docked complexes.Intracellular uptake assay of the liposomes by 4T1 cells2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well.

The cells were then collected, washed three times with pre-chilled PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Intracellular uptake of liposomes by Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cellsGlut 1 siRNA (5\u2019- CCAACUGGACCUCAAACUUTT -3\u2019) and siRNA mate were mixed in opti-MEM medium to form siRNA complexes. Then siRNA complex was added in cell culture medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 72\u00a0h. Then, C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 was added in the medium respectively for 4\u00a0h (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL). The cells were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). For confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) observation, the cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained and imaged as described previously.In vitro cytotoxicity studiesThe cytotoxicity of free DTX and different DTX formulations against 4T1 cells was examined with MTT cytotoxicity assay. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 4T1 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates.

Then, the medium was aspirated and 200 \u03bcL DMSO was added. After shaking for 30\u00a0min, the optical density (OD) value of each well was measured at 490\u00a0nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Trading Co., Ltd., Switzerland). The cell viability rate was calculated according to the following formula:Control: Untreated cells (viability rate 100%); Blank: (the wells with no cells).Cell apoptosis assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well. DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX was added in the medium and incubated with 4T1 cells, respectively (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Then the cells were collected and washed with PBS. Next, the cells were further stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. The apoptosis rate of the cells was then analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).At the same time, the 4T1 cells suspension (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105/ mL) was inoculated into 12-well plate with prepared cell sheets (0.1\u00a0ml cell suspension every cell sheet). The drug solution was changed according to the group described before after 24\u00a0h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33,342 and PI after 48\u00a0h of induction, then mounted with glycerol jelly mounting medium and exposed to inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) for qualitative observation and photo taking.Culture and polarization induction of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM)Bone marrow cells were collected from 6\u20138-week old specific pathogen-free male Balb/c mice as described above. Bone marrow cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 20\u00a0ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 96\u00a0h to induce bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) differentiation. Interferon-\u03b3 (20\u00a0ng/mL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500\u00a0ng/mL) were added to the medium for 24\u00a0h to induce the polarization toward M1 phenotype.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-cultured medium after different treatment was then collected. Then, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated for 24\u00a0h with 4T1-CM plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor or with different 4T1 cultured medium collected from 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX). 3T3 cultured medium collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with PBS (3T3-CM), 4T1-CM (3T3-CM @ 4T1-CM), 4T1-CM/SB-431542 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM/SB-431542)), 4T1-CM@DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@DTX)), 4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX)), 4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM)), 4T1-CM@Rg3 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3)), 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), 4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX)) or 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX)) were collected. The M1-type macrophages were incubated with different conditioned 3T3 cultured medium. After 48\u00a0h, the cells were collected and incubated with APC-F4/80 (BioLegend, UK), FITC-CD206 (BioLegend, UK) and PE-CD86 (BioLegend, UK) antibodies to label M2 and M1 cells, respectively. Then, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Penetration assay of the liposomes in 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroidsUnlike the spontaneous process of enriching fibroblasts by tumor cells during tumor progression in vivo, tumor cells were mixed with fibroblasts NIH-3T3 cells in vitro to manually mimic the stroma-rich TME. 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids containing 4T1 and NIH-3T3 were generated. 0.6\u00a0g of agarose was weighed and added to 30\u00a0mL of serum-free DMEM medium containing 1% cyan-chain double antibody, and kept in a constant temperature water bath at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, then transferred to the autoclave at 121\u00a0\u00b0C. Sterilize under high pressure for 30\u00a0min. After sterilization, the agarose solution was added to a 96-well plate with 50 \u03bcL per well. The 4T1 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were then digested, mixed and added to a 96-well cell culture plate containing agarose gel at 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL per well respectively. It was placed in a 37\u00b0 C incubator for cultivation. The fluid was changed every other day, and the tumor sphere grew to about 500\u00a0\u03bcm after 10\u00a0days. C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 were then administered, respectively. After incubating for 12\u00a0h, the tumor spheres were washed three times with PBS buffered saline solution, then transferred to a small dish, fluorescence of C6 was observed with CLSM (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) from the top layer of the tumor sphere to the bottom layer, a tomographic scan is performed every 10\u00a0\u03bcm. After the scanning, the penetration depth of the nanoparticles is analyzed and counted by the ZEN software provided by the instrument.Immunofluorescence staining of \u03b1-SMA1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX concentration, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), respectively. 4T1-conditioned medium after different treatment was obtained for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA assay) after 24\u00a0h. The 3T3 cells after different treatment were then IF stained and imaged with primary anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam) and Cy3-labeled fluorescent secondary antibody (33108ES60, Yeasen) according to the procedure as described before.In vivo imaging of tumor bearing mice5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were orthotopically injected into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of Balb/c female mice to develop the orthotopic TNBC model. Treatment was initiated at about 7\u00a0days after inoculation. The tumor bearing mice were divided randomly into two groups and were injected intravenously with C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD respectively. In vivo fluorescent images were taken under in vivo imaging system (IVIS) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24\u00a0h after injection. After 24\u00a0h, the mice were killed. Tumors, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys were then collected and imaged under IVIS system.In vivo antitumor efficacyOrthotopic TNBC model was developed by injecting 4T1 cells into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of BALB/c female mice. After 7\u00a0days, the mice were divided randomly into 8 groups (n\u2009=\u20096 per group) and each treated group was injected intravenously with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX (10\u00a0mg/kg of DTX) every 4\u00a0days for 20\u00a0days respectively. The length and width of tumors and the body weight were measured simultaneously. The tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following formula:Length (L) is the longest diameter and width (W) is the shortest diameter perpendicular to length. At Day 20, all mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were harvested for photo imaging and histological examination. For the histological analysis of apoptosis cells and CAFs in tumor tissue, the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and \u03b1-SMA staining of tumor slices was performed and full-scanned, In addition, for the histological analysis of the collagen in tumor tissue, MASSON staining was conducted and five randomly chosen microscopic fields were selected and semi-quantified by ImageJ software.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-CM after different treatment was then collected. The concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in the different medium was detected with ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction. The results were read using a microplate spectrophotometer at 450\u00a0nm (Thermo Multiskan MK3, USA). Tumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy and homogenized with pre-cooled PBS (5\u00a0ml PBS/1\u00a0g tumor). The prepared homogenate was centrifuged at 5000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min and the TGF-\u03b2 concentration in the supernatant was detected with the ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction.Western Blot (WB) assay3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The protein of the cells was then harvested according to the procedures described previously. 50\u00a0mg of protein per lane were loaded on the polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam), anti-phospho-Smad2/3 (ab272332, Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (30202ES40, Yeasen) overnight at 4\u2103 respectively. The following procedure was performed as previously described.Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytesTumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy. Cell suspensions derived from the obtained tumor tissues were prepared by grinding tumor tissues and passing the homogenate through 200-mesh sieve. The cell suspensions were then co-incubated with antibodies for T cells staining (CD45, CD4 and CD8), myeloid-derived suppressor cells staining (Gr1, CD11b and CD45), Tregs staining (CD45, CD4 and Foxp3), macrophages staining(CD45, F4/80, CD86 or CD206) and CAFs staining (\u03b1-SMA) for FACS analysis (BD Biosciences, USA).Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysisTotal RNAs were extracted with Trizol from tumor tissues obtained following the protocol of Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis were performed according to the procedures described before. The mouse \u03b1-SMA primer pairs were 5\u2032- ACACGGCATCATCACCAACTG -3\u2032 and 5\u2032- TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGTGGTGTC-3\u2032, The mouse GAPDH primer pairs were 5\u2019- CCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAATG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCGT-3\u2032.Safety evaluationTumor bearing mice were randomly divided into 8 groups. The administration protocol was the same as described above. At the end point, after the mice were sacrificed, their main organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) were excised and weighted for the calculation of organ weight index, then treated for histological examination. Blood samples were also collected for routine blood analyses.Statistical analysisResults are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D.

        "title": "Tumor stroma-containing 3D spheroid arrays: A tool to study nanoparticle penetration.",
        "content": "Nanoparticle penetration through tumor tissue after extravasation is considered as a key issue for tumor distribution and therapeutic effects. Most tumors possess abundant stroma, a fibrotic tissue composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a barrier for nanoparticle penetration. There is however a lack of suitable in vitro systems to study the tumor stroma penetration of nanoparticles. In the present study, we developed and thoroughly characterized a 3D co-culture spheroidal array to mimic tumor stroma and investigated the penetration of silica and PLGA nanoparticles in these spheroids. First, we examined human breast tumor patient biopsies to characterize the content and organization of stroma and found a high expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; 40% positive area) and collagen-1 (50% positive area). Next, we prepared homospheroids of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts alone as well as heterospheroids combining 3T3 and 4T1 cells in different ratios (1:1 and 5:1) using a microwell array platform. Confocal live imaging revealed that fibroblasts distributed and reorganized within 48h in heterospheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and gene expression analysis showed a proportional increase of \u03b1-SMA and collagen in heterospheroids with higher fibroblast ratios attaining 35% and 45% positive area at 5:1 (3T3:4T1) ratio, in a good match with the clinical breast tumor stroma. Subsequently, we studied the penetration of high and low negatively charged fluorescent silica nanoparticles (30nm; red and 100 or 70nm; green; zeta potential: -40mV and -20mV) and as well as Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles (200nm, -7mV) in both homo- and heterospheroid models. Fluorescent microscopy on spheroid cryosections after incubation with silica nanoparticles showed that 4T1 homospheroids allowed a high penetration of about 75-80% within 24h, with higher penetration in case of the 30nm nanoparticles. In contrast, spheroids with increasing fibroblast amounts significantly inhibited NP penetration. Silica nanoparticles with a less negative zeta potential exhibited lesser penetration compared to highly negative charged nanoparticles. Subsequently, similar experiments were conducted using Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles and confocal laser scanning microscopy; an increased nanoparticle penetration was found in 4T1 homospheroids until 48h, but significantly lower penetration in heterospheroids. Furthermore, we also developed human homospheroids (MDA-MB-231 or Panc-1 tumor cells) and heterospheroids (MDA-MB-231/BJ-hTert and Panc-1/pancreatic stellate cells) and performed silica nanoparticle (30 and 100nm) penetration studies. As a result, heterospheroids had significantly a lesser penetration of the nanoparticles compared to homospheroids. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that tumor stroma acts as a strong barrier for nanoparticle penetration. The 30-nm nanoparticles with low zeta potential favor deeper penetration. Furthermore, the herein proposed 3D co-culture platform that mimics the tumor stroma, is ideally suited to systematically investigate the factors influencing the penetration characteristics of newly developed nanomedicines to allow the design of nanoparticles with optimal penetration characteristics.",

        "title": "TGF-\u03b21-activated cancer-associated fibroblasts promote breast cancer invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by autophagy or overexpression of FAP-\u03b1.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the initiation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer. However, whether autophagy acts as a tumor promotion mechanism by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is still controversial and remains undefined at the mechanistic levels. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 is required for the invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT of breast cancer cells and underlying mechanism. We employed an in vitro model of NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub and confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 could convert fibroblasts into CAFs through autophagy under oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Modulation of autophagy by rapamycin, 3-methyladenine or ATG-5 knockdown regulated the expression of CAFs markers, suggesting a role of autophagy in the tumor promotion mechanism of TGF-\u03b21-induced CAFs activation. Furthermore, we established an indirect co-culture model and a mixed xenograft as a corresponding in vivo model. We demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT, which act through autophagy and overexpression of FAP-\u03b1 in both models, while autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked these effects induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Moreover, the co-localization of LC3\u03b2 and EMT marker vimentin in mixed xenograft also revealed that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor growth, pulmonary metastasis, and EMT program partly through autophagy. In addition, knockdown of FAP-\u03b1 resulted in reversed EMT and abolished tumor invasion and pulmonary metastasis induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Taken together, we conclude that both autophagy and FAP-\u03b1 are required for breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Targeting autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 rather than both can serve as a potential approach to improve the prognosis for human breast cancer.",

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The relative mRNA levels obtained by qRT-PCR were used to calculate the normalized log2 ratios. The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against CTGF (1:1000, ab209780), \u03b1-SMA (1:5000, ab124964), FAP (1:1000, ab207178) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, TA-10), and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, ZB-2301) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, ZB-2305) antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate was used to visualize the blots with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit. The total protein concentration was also examined, and then the concentrations of secreted protein of different samples were normalized to corresponding total protein.Lentiviral TransductionThe pLV-EF1\u03b1-CTGF-CMV-Puro lentiviral plasmid (CTGF-OE), negative control lentiviral plasmid (NC), CTGF-specific shRNAs (sh-CTGF), negative control shRNAs and the according lentivirus were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Co. (Shanghai, China). Viral titres of approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 infectious units/ml were obtained. Lentivirus infection was performed with polybrene according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates CTGF Expression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells and Inhibits Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFTo reveal the potential mechanism by which ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h. Pink and blue colors represent gene expression levels above and below the mean, respectively. (B) qPCR illustrated the downregulation of CTGF mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (C) and ELISA (D) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates Fibroblast Expression of CTGF and Inhibits the Ability of Breast Cancer Cells to Transform Fibroblasts Into CAF-Like CellsBecause CTGF is associated with the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, we examined the effect of ATL-1 on CTGF expression in fibroblasts. We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation. (-) in (E) represent without ATL-1 and rCTGF treatment. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Increased the Sensitivity of TNBC Cells to Paclitaxel by Downregulating the Expression of CTGF in FibroblastsTo study the role of CTGF in the sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts and then examined the effects of ATL-1 and rCTGF on the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.Atractylenolide-I Sensitizes Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Paclitaxel in a Mouse ModelFinally, we analyzed the effect of ATL-1 on chemosensitivity in vivo. We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6). When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment and ATL-1 treatment were started. Primary tumor size was measured and quantified every three days for 6 weeks. The abscissa represents the time after the start of treatment. (B) Representative images of metastatic tumors in lungs and liver, which were stained with HE. The numbers of micrometastatic lesions in the lungs and liver were quantified. (C) The expression of CTGF in primary tumors was examined by Western blotting. (D) qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in primary cultured fibroblasts derived from inoculated tumors. (A, B) Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05 by Student\u2019s t test. (C, D) Three independent experiments were performed for each of the Balb/c mice in the four groups. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by Student\u2019s t test.DiscussionAtractylodolactone-1 has been shown to significantly inhibit the tumorigenesis and development of a variety of tumors and increase the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapy. Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

        "content": "The aim of the present study was to investigate which growth factors, receptors, and growth inhibiting factors are expressed in invasive breast cancer. Five (angiogenic) growth factors and their receptors: platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-AA) and PDGF receptor alpha (PDGF alpha R), PDGF-BB and PDGF beta receptor, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) and its receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I (Flt-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor II (Flk-1/KDR); two growth inhibiting factors: transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF beta 1) and (TGF beta 2) and their receptor couple transforming growth factor beta receptor I (TGF beta R-I) and TGF beta R-II; and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were stained by standard immunohistochemistry on frozen sections in 45 cases of invasive carcinoma of the breast. Staining was scored as negative or positive in tumour epithelium, stroma, and blood vessels. TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 were expressed in the tumour cells in 67 per cent and 76 per cent of cases, respectively, whereas PDG beta R and TGF beta R-II were expressed in 0 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The other factors showed variable expression in tumour cells. All factors were expressed in the stroma in most cases, except Flt-1, Flk-1/KDR, TGF beta 2, and TGF beta R-II, which showed variable expression, and EGFR, which showed no expression. The endothelium was in most cases positive for bFGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, VEGF, PDGF alpha R, PDGF beta R, and TGF beta 1 but TGF beta/ was negative in most cases and TGF alpha, EGFR, Flt-1, Flk-1/KDR, TGF beta R-I, and TGF beta R-II were variably expressed. The most interesting possible auto/paracrine loops, as demonstrated on serial sections and by fluorescence double staining, were the TGF alpha/EGFR, TGF beta s/TGF beta R, VEGF/Flt-1, and the VEGF/Flk-1 combinations. In conclusion, growth factors, growth inhibiting factors, and their receptors are frequently expressed in invasive breast cancer. Indications for some possible auto- and paracrine loops have been found, which should encourage further study on the role of these factors in breast cancer proliferation and angiogenesis.",

        "full_text": "Gestational diabetes is associated with alteration on pelvic floor muscle activation pattern during pregnancy and postpartum: Prospective cohort using electromyography assessmentBackground and objectiveGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a comorbidity which may cause acute and lifelong disorders to mother and child. Alterations in muscular and connective tissues have been associated with GDM in translation studies, characterizing gestational diabetic myopathy. Pregnancy-specific urinary incontinence and sexual disabilities, disorders that depend on the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) integrity, are also associated with GDM both during and after pregnancy. The aim was to compare PFM activation patterns between GDM and non-GDM women from 24\u201330 gestational weeks to 18\u201324 months postpartum during a standard clinical test during gestation and postpartum.MethodsWe conducted a prospective three-time-point cohort study from gestation (24\u201330 weeks\u2014T1, and 36\u201338 weeks\u2014T2) to 18\u201324 months postpartum (T3). PFM electromyography was recorded in primigravida or primiparous women with one previous elective c-section with or without the diagnosis of GDM according to the American Diabetes Association criteria. A careful explanation of the muscle anatomy and functionality of the PFM was given to participants before EMG assessment. The outcome measures were PFM activation patterns assessed during pregnancy and postpartum, comparing intra and between groups. PFM activation patterns were assessed by normalized electromyography signal at rest and during 1-second (sec) phasic, 10-sec hold, and 60-sec sustained contractions.ResultsDemographic and obstetric data showed homogeneity between groups. The GDM group achieved peak PFM EMG amplitudes similarly to the non-GDM group, but they took longer to return to baseline levels during the ~1-sec contraction (flicks). During 10-sec hold contractions, the GDM group sustained lower levels of PFM activation than the non-GDM group at both 36\u201338 weeks of gestation and 18\u201324 months postpartum when compared to the non-GDM group.ConclusionThe results suggest that GDM impaired PFM control mainly on 1-sec flicks and 10-sec hold contraction, which appears to develop during late pregnancy and extends long-term postpartum. This motor behavior may play a role on pelvic floor dysfunctions.IntroductionGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational diabetic myopathy have been described as risk factors to pelvic floor muscle dysfunction (PFMD) during pregnancy and postpartum. Compromised PFM integrity may predispose women to PFMD such as pregnancy-specific urinary incontinence (PS-UI) and postpartum urinary incontinence, which have substantial social and economic burden, in addition to high public health costs. More specifically, GDM has been associated with higher prevalence of both PS-UI and IU postpartum, with worsening of severity and quality of life during pregnancy and over the first year postpartum compared to non-GDM women. Taken together, current evidence indicates that PFM could be failing to perform contractions properly in women with GDM. A clinical triad composed of pelvic floor muscle (PFM) myopathy, PS-UI, and GDM is the focus of research. However, there is a lack of studies with longitudinal design assessing PFM function during and after pregnancy, especially in the GDM group.Experimental studies in moderate diabetic rat models have shown that the periurethral and rectus abdominis muscles present deterioration, such as atrophy, thinning, disorganization, and co-localization of fast and slow fibers. These data are consistent with those observed in rectus abdominis muscle tissues collected from pregnant women with GDM during C-section, which suggests that GDM is indeed capable of damaging the muscular tissue causing a myopathic process. Establishing a rational line by the morphological findings from urethral and rectus abdominis muscle of rats and rectus abdominis on pregnant women, the PFM is also potentially impacted by the myopathic process. Due to the invasive nature of PFM biopsy, functional tests have been employed to evaluate the impact of GDM on its function. Electrophysiological tools such as electromyography (EMG) have been used to understand PFM motor behavior during pregnancy, but fewer showed how GDM implies PFM function impairments when compared to non-diabetic pregnant women. In a study using electromyography (EMG), the amplitude of PFM signals during rest and hold contraction was decreased from the second to the third trimester. When three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D-US) was used, negative biometric changes, such as a low increase in the hiatal area, a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter, and a reduced levator ani muscle thickness, have also been observed between these two time points.Although previous studies have demonstrated impairments in PFM function associated with GDM, current evidence is still inconclusive in relation to the time frame in which these impairments evolve and whether women with GDM are capable of recovering PFM function after delivery. These are important clinical questions to understand the underlying pathophysiology of PFMD. Hence, the aim of this longitudinal study was to compare PFM activation patterns between GDM and non-GDM women from 24\u201330 gestational weeks to 18\u201324 months postpartum during a standard clinical test during gestation and postpartum.MethodsStudy design, participants, and group compositionThis prospective cohort study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of the Botucatu Medical School of Sao Paulo State University (Protocol Number CAAE 82225617.0.0000.5411). The STROBE checklist was applied on the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after careful explanation of all research procedures.The inclusion criteria were as follows: pregnant women between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation in the first assessment; singleton pregnancy; 18\u201340 years of age; ability to perform a palpable contraction of the PFM; had not received PFM training or any musculoskeletal PFM treatment previously or during pregnancy. The exclusion criteria were clinical diagnosis of diabetes (type I or II, or overt diabetes in previous pregnancy), history of urinary incontinence (UI), having had more than two pregnancies, previous vaginal delivery, previous prolapse or incontinence surgery, failure to understand or follow the command to contract PFM, history of neurological diseases, visible genital prolapse, cervical isthmus incompetence, smoking, preterm birth, abortion, and participants who withdrew their consent during cohort.The diagnosis guidelines proposed by the American Diabetes Association were used to identify patients with GDM using the 75-g oral glycemic tolerance test (75g-OGTT). The test was applied to all participants at 24 gestational weeks, and participants were assigned to the GDM group if they presented fasting glycemic levels \u226592 mg/dl or 1 h \u2265180 mg/dl or 2 h \u2265153 mg/dl. Conversely, participants who had lower glycemic levels were allocated to the non-GDM group.Participant recruitment and assessmentParticipants were evaluated at three time points: 24\u201330 weeks of gestation (T1), at 36\u201338 weeks of gestation (T2), and 18\u201324 months postpartum (T3). The same procedures were followed at each time point.Eighty-two participants between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation who met the criteria were recruited from the Perinatal Diabetes Research Center (PDRC) of Botucatu Medical School/UNESP/Brazil, between 2017 and 2019. After giving their written consent, they were invited to answer a questionnaire with personal details; clinical and obstetric historic and anthropometric measures were taken.Afterward, the PFM examination was explained and subsequently conducted by a single trained physiotherapist (CBP) with 4 years of experience in PFM evaluation. After emptying their bladder, participants were asked to lie down on the stretcher in supine position with their lower limbs flexed. Explanation about the anatomy and function of PFM was provided. To guarantee that participants understood the instructions, vaginal digital palpation was performed, and a PFM contraction was requested by giving the verbal instruction \u201csqueeze the vaginal muscle and hold them as hard as possible, as if you were holding urine until I say to relax\u201d. Visual inspection was held to ensure an isolated PFM contraction was well executed, without unusual/excessive co-contraction of the adductor and gluteus, hip movements, or expulsion movements. Afterward, participants were asked to perform a short sequence of PFM contractions, in preparation to the Glazer protocol of clinical evaluation that would be used for the PFM EMG assessment: three brief contractions of 1-sec (Flick) phasic contraction and three contractions sustained for 10-sec (Hold) sustained PFM contractions. Participants received strong verbal encouragement and during contractions, and digital palpation was used to confirm that they performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) on every attempt. During the 5-min rest period before EMG recordings, additional instructions were given depending on the performance, any possible doubts were clarified addressed, and the instruction to contract the PFM as hard as they could before relaxing was reinforced.EMG recordings and experimental protocolThe EMG signals were recorded using a two-channel device (Miotool 200 Uro; Porto Alegre, Brazil) with a gain of 1,000, a 14-bit A/D converter, an input impedance of 10 Ohm/2 pF, and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) at 126 dB. Signals were sampled at 2,000 Hz. PFM EMG was recorded using only one channel and an intravaginal probe sensor ( Figure\u00a01A ) with two opposite stainless-steel electrodes (85 \u00d7 25 mm) positioned on both sides of the vaginal sidewall, coupled to a differential sensor with a ring connection. A water-soluble gel was applied before introducing the probe into the vaginal canal. The reference electrode was placed on the ulna\u2019s styloid process following the SENIAM recommendations.Glazer Protocol plots showing full signal and intravaginal probe image (A), protocol segment tasks (B) and contraction time window with all performed tasks (C).The Glazer clinical protocol ( Figure\u00a01A ) was used to standardize PFM activation. The protocol consists of the following sequence: (i) a 60-sec rest (Baseline-pre); (ii) brief 1-sec phasic contractions (Flicks) repeated five times, followed by a 10-sec rest interval; (iii) 10-sec sustained contractions (Hold) repeated five times, with a 10-sec rest in between; (iv) a 60-sec sustained endurance contraction (Endurance); and (v) a 60-sec rest (Baseline-post) ( Figure\u00a01B ). The following verbal instructions were given to all participants to explain the execution of each task: (i) \u201cPlease, stay relaxed as quite as possible, until I say to you to contract the PFM\u201d (Baseline-pre); (ii) \u201cPlease, squeeze your vaginal and anus muscles as harder as possible and relax as soon as instruct you\u201d (Flick); (iii) \u201cPlease, squeeze and hold your vagina and anus as harder and as long as possible until 10 seconds\u201d (Hold). They were encouraged to sustain the MVC during 10 sec by the verbal instruction: \u201ckeep squeezing, keep going, keep going\u201d; (iv) during the 60-sec endurance contraction, the same instruction used for the 10-sec Hold contraction was given, but the instruction to \u201ckeep squeezing, contract, keep going, contract as harder as possible, keep going\u201d was continuously repeated during the 60 sec; (v) and in the last 60-sec rest period (baseline-post), participants were instructed to \u201cRelax your vagina and anus as much as possible and stay relaxed for 60-sec\u201d.Electromyographic signal processingThe EMG signals were processed offline using custom programs using a band-pass filter of 20\u2013500 Hz implemented in MATLAB (2014b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). First, the quality of the signals from each data collection was evaluated based on visual inspection and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recordings with a low SNR, where the EMG was not discernible from the background or contains excessive signal artifacts, were removed from the analyses (n = 13). Because we detected significant contamination from the power line (60 Hz), an adaptive least mean squares (LMS) filter was implemented, using MATLAB function dsp.LMSFilter, in order to selectively remove contamination at 60 Hz and higher harmonics. The central frequency of the filter was adjusted in each case, depending on the presence of contamination in each harmonic.The EMG profiles were obtained by applying the root mean square (RMS) function to the entire signal using a sliding window of 200 msec. Consistent with previous studies using the same protocol, the RMS EMG profiles were then normalized by the highest peak detected across the five repetitions of the Flick task. Although the Glazer protocol defines fixed time windows for the execution of each task, we ensured the precise selection of time windows of each contraction task by using a single-threshold algorithm to automatically detect the EMG onset and offset of muscle activity, which were confirmed by visual inspection (see  Figure\u00a01 ). Rest periods (Baseline-pre and -post) were initially selected from the timing expected from the protocol and were also visually inspected, with adjustments when necessary.To characterize the muscle activation patterns of each subject, we extracted the following parameters from the normalized RMS EMG profiles of each task: average and peak amplitudes, standard deviation of the amplitude, and coefficient of variation. For the Flick and Hold tasks, we also extracted the time from EMG onset to peak amplitude and the time from peak amplitude to EMG offset. Using time windows of 200 msec, we also estimated the slopes (%/sec) of the RMS EMG after EMG onset (i.e., \u201cincrease rate of activity\u201d) and before EMG offset (i.e., \u201cdecrease rate of activity\u201d), as well as the slopes before and after the time of peak amplitude ( Figure\u00a02 ).Example EMG recording of the Flick task from a representative subject, illustrating the EMG variables used in the analyses.Finally, the full RMS EMG waveforms from the Flick and Hold tasks were compared between groups using the technique of wavelet-functional ANOVA (wfANOVA). As we were interested in both the phasic activation patterns and the rest amplitudes before and after each contraction, we selected time windows that included 3 sec before and after each contraction. Using Subject as a random effect, all task repetitions from each subject were included in the wfANOVA model. For each task, the RMS EMG waveforms were transformed into the wavelet domain, allowing temporally localized features to be represented by a small number of orthogonal (independent) wavelet coefficients. These coefficients were then statistically tested between groups using a one-way ANOVA at each time point to evaluate if there were differences in PFM activation patterns between groups. Significant between-group contrasts were identified and transformed back from the wavelet domain into the time domain for visualization.Sample size estimationSample size calculation was performed a priori using G*Power. Calculations were performed considering a repeated measures design, a power of 0.80, a probability of error \u03b1 0.05, and an effect size of 0.25 calculated by the partial n\u00b2 of 0.06. According to the study design, it was considered for the calculation two groups (GDM and non-GDM) and three measurements (i.e., three time points), an estimated correlation among repetition measures of 0.5, and non-sphericity correction of 1; the estimated sample size required was at least 28 participants (14 in each group).Statistical methodsThe software IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA), was used for statistical analysis. The chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied to compare the nominal data between groups. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied to compare independent categories on table. The EMG parameters were tested using a two-way general linear model (GLM), with Group (GDM, non-GDM) and Time Point as factors, with repeated measures on the time-point factor (i.e., within-subject). The hypothesis of sphericity was tested by the Mauchly test, and when the sphericity was rejected, the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser correction was applied. When a significant main effect or interaction effect was found, pair-wise post-hoc tests were applied using Bonferroni correction and relative percentages were used to show the magnitude of differences on the statistical tests. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, the full RMS EMG waveforms from the Flick and Hold tasks were compared between groups using the technique of wfANOVA. Differences were considered statistically significant if p <.05.ResultsFlow of participants through the studyThe flowchart in  Figure\u00a03  illustrates the number of women examined at each time point and the reasons for dropout. Among all initially included participants (n = 82), 48 women were allocated in the non-GDM group and 34 in the GDM group. Sixty-two participants remained on T2 (34 non-GDM and 28 GDM), and 46 returned to complete T3 on postpartum (26 non-GDM and 20 GDM). The reasons for dropout were not related with DMG complications. Due to technical failure related to an inappropriate signal-to-noise ratio (maybe attributed to probe movement, inherent equipment/ambient noise) and/or not detectable EMG burst (maybe due to intrinsic reasons), the inclusion of 13 participants was unfeasible. Therefore, the EMG analyses were proceeded with participants who had all time points completed and with good EMG signal quality (19 non-GDM and 14 GDM).GDM women\u2019s screening, diagnosis, enrollment, follow-up analysis and reasons for signal exclusion from analysis.No significant group differences were found in participant characteristics during gestation or postpartum ( Table\u00a01 ).

Data are presented in median (minimum\u2013maximum) or absolute frequency (n) and percentage (%). p-values are based on *Mann\u2013Whitney U, $chi-square, and #Fisher\u2019s exact. Significance p < 0.05. p-values represent the results from the relevant statistical tests.  Table\u00a02  shows the average (and standard deviation) of the parameters extracted from the RMS EMG divided across groups and time points, as well as the results from the GLM. The variables evaluated during the 60-sec pre-baseline did not differ between or within groups. During the 1-sec Flick contractions, there was an interaction between time points and groups on the average EMG amplitude [F(1.619,43.759) = 4.568; p = .022]. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the GDM group decreased (-11.0%) the activation levels from T1 to T3 (p = .040). Additionally, during T1, the GDM group showed a higher (+12.1%) slope after onset (increased rate of EMG activity) compared to the non-GDM group [main effect of group, F (1,27) = 4.504; p = .043, post-hoc p = .043]. Moreover, the main effects of time point revealed that, independent of group, women took more time to reach peak EMG, during T1 compared to T3 (non-GDM: 22.2% and GDM: +11.1%) [F (2,54) = 8.354; p <.001, post-hoc p <.001]; the task duration was lower at T1 compared to T2 (non-GDM: -16.6% and GDM: -5.5%), and T3 (non-GDM and GDM: -16.6%) in both groups decreased from T1 to T2 [F (2,54) = 9.536; p <.001, post-hoc T1 to T2 p = .008 and T1 to T3 p <.001]; and the rate of EMG increase after onset was lower during T1 compared to T2 (non-GDM: +48.5% and GDM: +6.6%) [F (2,54) = 3.633; p = .033, post-hoc p = .041]. Finally, interactions between Group and Time Points revealed that the standard deviation of the EMG amplitude on the non-GDM group increased from T1 to T2 (+12.1%) [F (2,54) = 3.345; p = .043, post-hoc p = .031] and the EMG slope before offset (decrease rate of EMG activity) was less intense at T1 compared to T2 (-55.4%) and T3 (-47.4%) in the non-GDM group [F (2,54) = 4.812; p = .012

Same letters and symbols indicate differences detected by post-hoc (Bonferroni) contrasts test; p value < 0.05.Results are presented from the two-way general linear model (GLM) using factors Group (non-GDM, GDM) and Time Point (T1: 24\u201330 weeks of gestation, T2: 36\u201338 weeks of gestation, T3: 18\u201324 months postpartum) as factors, with repeated measures on Time Point.During the 10-sec hold task, there was an interaction between Group and Time Point on the time from peak to EMG offset [F (2,62) = 5.068; p = .009], indicating that the GDM group took less time to return to baseline after the peak in T3 compared to T2 (-20%) (p = .023). The main effects of Time Point revealed that, independent of group, task duration was larger at T3 than both T1 (non-GDM: +2.8% and GDM: +1.9%) and T2 (non-GDM: +1.9% and GDM: +2.8%) [F(1.580,46.735) = 3.895; p = .026, post-hoc T1 to T3 p = .023 and T1 to T3 p = .023] and that the EMG slope before peak was greater at T3 compared to T1 (non-GDM: +16.7% and GDM: +37%) [F (2,62) = 3.335; p = .042, post-hoc p = .035].During the last PFM contraction task of the protocol, the 60-sec hold, there were no significant main effects of interactions with Group or Time Point. During the 60-sec post-baseline rest period, there was a significant effect of Group on the standard deviation of EMG amplitude, and the GDM group showed a lower amplitude (-62.5%) compared to the non-GDM group [F (1,10) = 5.319; p = .044]. A main effect of Time Point revealed that the peak amplitude was greater at T3 than at T2 (non-GDM: +7% and GDM: +264.8%) [F(2,20) = 4.152; p = .031, p = .023] independent of group.  Figure\u00a04  shows the results of the wfANOVA analysis, with the average EMG patterns of each group and the significant Group contrasts during the Flick and Hold PFM contraction tasks at each time point. The significant contrasts indicate that, during the Flick contractions, the GDM group generally had a greater PFM EMG amplitude than non-GDM after ~1 sec of contraction, suggesting to return from peak amplitude to baseline level contractions. During the 10-sec Hold contractions, the non-GDM group activated the PFM at higher contraction intensities than the GDM group at both time points T2 and T3, although the timing of the contrasts differed between time points: At T2, the GDM group had a lower initial peak amplitude during Hold but similar amplitudes after ~2 sec of contraction; at T3, the initial peaks from both groups had similar (normalized) amplitudes, after which the levels of PFM activation decreased faster for the GDM group, remaining lower than for the non-GDM group until near the end of the contraction.Group average and SD of the RMS EMG during the 1-sec Flick and 10-sec Hold PFM contraction tasks from Glazer protocol. Before averaging, the EMG patterns from each subject was expressed as percentage of the peak recorded during the 1-sec Flick contractions. Positive contrasts indicate that GDM < non-GDM.

Using a well-established protocol for pelvic floor assessment, we reproduced a similar sequence of PFM contractions requested in clinical consultations, commonly used to identify the motor strategy during brief and sustained PFM tasks. No significant group differences were found during the Baseline-pre and Endurance tasks, and only minor differences during Baseline-post. During 1-sec Flick contractions, the EMG activation of all participants decreased on postpartum compared to T1. Wavelet analysis showed that, although the GDM group achieved peak PFM EMG amplitudes similar to the non-GDM, they took longer to return to baseline levels. During 10-sec Hold contractions, the GDM group sustained lower levels of PFM activation than the non-GDM group at both T2 and T3.Our study was based on evidence of changes in physiological and anatomical factors in the female PFM demonstrated by morphological studies in pregnant rats and humans. A reduced ratio of fast to slow fibers and a co-localization of fast and slow fibers have been observed in striated urethral muscle of diabetic pregnant rats compared with non-diabetics and non-pregnant rats. More recently, similar findings were found in rectus abdominis muscles of pregnant women with GDM, who showed a decreased cross-sectional area of both slow and fast muscle fibers, in addition to a decreased number of fast fibers and an increased number of slow fibers.It is reasonable that morphologic and metabolic changes in PFMs are likely to contribute to UI. Indeed, higher UI prevalence and severity have been associated with hyperglycemic disturbances not only during pregnancy but also on prediabetes and clinical diabetes. Three-dimensional ultrasonography during rest showed that there is a decrement of the thickness of the levator ani muscle during pregnancy, which is consistent with previous morphological findings of a myopathic process on musculoskeletal tissue of GDM pregnant women. However, conclusive evidence to support this relationship has not yet been assessed due to the lack of studies assessing pelvic floor function by direct measures, particularly on pregnancy until medium and long-term postpartum.Autonomic neuropathic dysfunctions in the bladder are associated with hyperglycemia. Besides it, findings on external anal sphincter using electrophysiological methods showed that diabetic polyneuropathy caused by clinical diabetes mellitus (DM) affects the pudendal nerve by an increase in motor unit action potentials (MUPs), mean duration, mean amplitude, mean phases, satellite rate, and percentage of long-duration MUPs and polyphasic potentials.Previous studies in pregnant woman populations with GDM showed differences in PFM activation between GDM and non-GDM groups at 24\u201330 and 36\u201338 weeks of gestation, particularly during rest and hold contractions. Although different EMG processing and normalization methods hinder direct comparison with the present study, our results complement previous findings by demonstrating that, as they approach the end of pregnancy, women with GDM show reduced ability to perform brief PFM contractions and to sustain long PFM contractions at the same level as their non-GDM counterparts.Motor control studies have shown that the reduction in EMG amplitude secondary to muscle weakness could not fully explain the UI, and they showed that the pre-activation of the PFM could have a great contribution on the continence mechanisms. Other mechanisms should be addressed to explain better the motor strategy used by the GDM group along. Thus, we decided to include, besides the amplitude and peak quantification; analyses of contraction oscillation; temporal analyses related to onset, peak, and offset; and rate of recruitment during the begin and end of the contraction and the peak.The findings from the 1-sec Flick contractions showed that the GDM group decreased their levels of PFM activation from T1 to T3, whereas the non-GDM group maintained similar levels of activation along time points. We believe that the significant increase in amplitude standard deviation clinically implies about amplitude variability during the same task the non-GDM group could contribute to allow the non-GDM group to maintain the level of activation. The implications of low or high variability is still controversial in literature, but there is evidence that a higher variability may represent an adaptive mechanism to maintain the task performance.The impairments in PFM function observed in women with GDM have been attributed to physiological and anatomical changes to the musculoskeletal system, namely, reduced cross-sectional area and reduced number of fast fiber type, in addition to impairments in ionic channels, as well as fat infiltration and proliferation of connective tissue in the PFM. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude other confounding factors, including the volitional component (i.e., choose not to activate) and technical aspects inherent to EMG acquisition which could affect both groups.Both groups achieved peak quicker on T3 compared to T1 on the flicks task. As this characteristic was the same on the groups and no differences were found between T1 and T2, the pregnancy itself may have an implication on it. A quicker response of the pelvic floor is important mainly when intra-abdominal pressure is higher to promote continence. Other studies should consider exploring the latency of PFM onset to peak in comparing it with other structures involved on the modulation of intra-abdominal pressure.Although our protocol had a standard task duration, we observed that both groups decreased duration in the flicks contractions on T2 and T3 compared to T1 to T2 in both groups and achieved peak on T3 quicker than T1. We believe that this is probably a result of a learning effect: as participants got familiar with the tasks, both groups were able to reach peak amplitude more quickly than before, increasing the rate of EMG activity (slope after onset). Additionally, we expected on T1 that the groups may have the same recruitment characteristics, but the GDM group activates PFM around 60% more per second compared to non-GDM.Concerning the deactivation on the end of the task (slope before offset), the non-GDM decreased the rate of EMG activity intensely from T1 to T2 and from T1 to T3. The GDM group used the same strategy to relax pelvic floor muscle along time points. When comparing the full RMS EMG waveforms between groups, we found that, at all three time points, the GDM group took longer T1 to return from peak amplitude to baseline levels, as revealed by a higher EMG amplitude compared to non-GDM after peak EMG. This observation wave characteristic is corroborated by a recent study applying the same protocol to continent and incontinent women that found that the incontinent group took more time to relax after Flick contractions.On the 10-sec Hold tasks, whereas traditional amplitude measurements were not able to identify major differences between groups or time points, the analyses in the wavelet domain found a reduced EMG amplitude in the GDM group compared to non-GDM at time points T2 and T3, which means that when events along the task are taken into consideration, different motor control patterns are found between groups along the task duration in each time point. During T1, the motor pattern was mostly similar between groups. It could be explained by the fact that this is the screening period to GDM, so it is the point that glycemia starts to get higher and maybe there is no drastic influence on muscle yet. Also, the discrete but significant differences on T2 could be explained by the fact that the cross-section area of slow fibers are decreased in the GDM group. Although the capacity of the morphological recovery on postpartum is unknown, our findings suggest that PFM control continues to be impaired postpartum in the GDM group. Additionally, the GDM group took more time to return from peak to offset from T2 and T3. Although the task duration statistically increased from T1 to T2 and T3, it was less than 1 sec and may not be relevant clinically.During post-baseline resting, there were differences related to the peak from T2 to T3 in both groups and the GDM group on T2 oscillated less during the final resting. Although significant, these two characteristics without an additional change on average amplitude, clinically, do not provide a valuable reflection about the task in general.EMG is a valuable but challenging method to evaluate PFM function; hence, interpretation of the present results should be made with caution to avoid mistaken conclusions. Although the findings from the present study may be partially explained by morpho-pathological processes involved in GDM, there are several concerns to consider: first, the test\u2013retest reliability of PFM EMG amplitude along time points shows heterogeneity among studies in the literature. Previous studies have suggested that this heterogeneity arises mainly due to electrode movement, which contaminates the signal with motion artifact and changes the population of motor units recorded, making it difficult to evaluate the same motor units across different time points. In addition, some studies have assessed raw EMG amplitudes, which turns the external validity and results comparisons unfeasible.This novel cohort study evaluated PFM activity in pregnant women with and without GDM at three distinct time points during and after delivery. We argue that the strengths of the study were that (i) we only included continent pregnant women; (ii) we excluded from analysis participants who did not complete the cohort entirely; (iii) only high-quality EMG was included on the analysis, confirmed by high SNR and absence of signal artifacts; (iv) we assessed many different parameters, including traditional amplitude and timing parameters and the assessment of the full RMS EMG waveform, in an attempt to perform a comprehensive assessment of the motor strategies during PFM contractions; and (v) the EMG amplitude of each subject was normalized by the maximal voluntary activation to allow comparisons between groups and time points.Nevertheless, we also acknowledge some limitations in our study, which should be taken into consideration in future studies. First, we had a relatively high dropout rate, which is a common problem in cohort studies and randomized controlled trials assessing pregnant women, probably underpinned by the major changes in women\u2019s life that accompany pregnancy and delivery. Second, the assessment of vaginal pressure or force, concomitant with EMG, would have been valuable to assess changes in force-generating capacity and allow more reliable estimates of maximal voluntary contractions. In addition, we also did not consider fatigue measurements, mainly because as shown by other authors we have a gap on literature about standardized protocols to assess PFM fatigue. Third is the employment of intravaginal high-density surface electromyography to allow others such as the number of motor unit action potentials by the decomposed signal. Finally, the use of vaginal probes with suction, designed to minimize movement artifacts and ensure optimal electrode alignment with the muscle fiber direction, is likely to enhance the technical quality of the EMG recordings.ConclusionOur findings show impaired PFM motor control strategies on pregnant women with GDM compared to non-GDM during execution of 1-sec Flick and 10-sec Hold contractions during pregnancy and 18\u201324 months postpartum. Taken together, these results suggest that differences on motor behavior of GDM women arise in late pregnancy and exacerbate on postpartum.Research implicationsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide information about PFM neuromuscular strategy of woman GDM in a long-term follow-up. Further studies should be necessary to investigate the influence of this strategy on PFM strength and pelvic floor dysfunctions. This additional information should be important to delineate preventive and therapeutic strategies on this population.Data availability statementThe authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

        "title": "Human breast carcinoma desmoplasia is PDGF initiated.",
        "content": "The desmoplastic response to human breast carcinoma is a host myofibroblast-mediated collagenous response exhibiting synergistic effects on tumor progression. Although many paracrine interactions between breast carcinoma cells and myofibroblasts have been characterized, the event(s) which initiate desmoplasia have remained undefined. Our studies utilized c-rasH transfected MCF-7 cells which overexpress ras p2l and which are weakly tumorigenic in ovariectomized nude mice. The xenografts are desmoplastic and comprised of 30% myofibroblasts and 60 mg/g of interstitial collagen. In situ hybridization studies of these xenografts reveal a stromal gene expression pattern (stromelysin-3, IGF-II and TIMP-1) identical to that observed in human tumor desmoplasia. 17-beta estradiol increases c-rasH MCF-7 growth but abolishes desmoplasia. c-rasH MCF-7 in vitro constitutively produce myofibroblast mitogenic activity which competes with PDGF in a receptor binding assay. This myofibroblast mitogenic activity is unaltered by 17-beta estradiol/tamoxifen pretreatment in vitro. Transfection of c-rasH MCF-7 with a PDGF-A dominant negative mutant, 1308, produced by site-directed mutagenesis (serine--&gt;cysteine129) reduces both homo- and heterodimer secretion of PDGF by as much as 90% but does not interfere with the secretion of other growth factors. Clones with low PDGF, though tumorigenic, are non-desmoplastic. Our results suggest that breast carcinoma-secreted PDGF is the major initiator of tumor desmoplasia.",

        "full_text": "Solid tumours showing oligoprogression to immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential for abscopal effectsPurposeGiven the uncertainty surrounding the abscopal effect (AE), it is imperative to identify promising treatment targets. In this study, we aimed to explore the incidence of AE when administering radiotherapy to patients with oligoprogressive solid tumours while they are undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).Materials and methodsIn this multicentre prospective observational study, oligoprogressive disease was defined as a\u2009<\u200920% increase in lesions compared to\u2009>\u20092\u00a0months before enrolment. We enrolled patients who requested radiotherapy during the ICI rest period between 2020 and 2023. AE was considered present if\u2009\u2265\u20091 non-irradiated lesion decreased by\u2009\u2265\u200930% before the next line of systemic therapy started.ResultsTwelve patients were included in this study; the common primary lesions were in the lungs (four patients) and kidneys (three patients). AEs were observed in six (50%) patients, with a median time to onset of 4 (range 2\u20139) months after radiotherapy. No significant predictors of AEs were identified. Patients in the AE group had a significantly better 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate than those in the non-AE group (p\u2009=\u20090.008). Two patients from the AE group were untreated and progression-free at the last follow-up. Four (33%) patients experienced grade 2 toxicity, with two cases attributed to radiotherapy and the other two to ICI treatment. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in any category.ConclusionPatients with oligoprogressive disease may be promising targets with potential for AEs. AEs can lead to improved PFS and, in rare cases, to a certain progression-free period without treatment.Secondary AbstractIrradiating solid tumours in patients with oligoprogressive disease during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be a promising target with the potential for abscopal effects (AEs). AEs can lead to improved progression-free survival and, in rare cases, to a certain progression-free period without treatment.IntroductionWith the advent of immunotherapy, the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage cancer has considerably improved. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are typical examples of such drugs, and their use has expanded recently to treat various solid tumours. However, favourable responses are limited to a small number of patients, and the emergence of resistance to ICIs is a significant concern. If the effect is poor, the next line of treatment is considered. However, there are frequently no effective treatment options, especially for frail patients. Therefore, activating antitumour immunity through additional treatments is currently the focus of attention. This strategy is exemplified by a combination of systemic therapies that reprogram the immune microenvironment of tumours. Another option is to combine ICI therapy with radiotherapy.Although radiotherapy is a local treatment, it is also used to relieve symptoms and reduce the overall tumour burden in advanced cases. Simultaneously, the abscopal effect (AE), though rare, is a phenomenon where antitumour immunity is induced, leading to the regression of tumours outside the irradiated area. Improved prognosis is a result of the AE and is highly beneficial for patients. However, the AE has been criticised for its unpredictable occurrence. Numerous reports have shown few or no AEs resulting from the combination of ICI and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy imposes a time and cost burden on the patient and sometimes severe toxicity. Therefore, targeting AEs and using radiotherapy extensively without the goal of pain relief or local control are inappropriate. It is necessary to identify promising targets for which the AE can be expected to have a high probability of success.In this study, we focused on a condition called oligoprogressive disease. Oligoprogressive disease is not clearly defined; however, it refers to patients with slow or limited progression during systemic treatment. Although patients with oligoprogressive disease are at an advanced stage, local treatments, such as surgery and radiotherapy, may improve prognoses. We hypothesised that patients with oligoprogressive disease who received radiotherapy during ICI treatment would have a high rate of AEs. This prospective multicentre observational study aimed to investigate the incidence of AEs based on the hypothesis.Materials and methodsPatientsWe conducted a multicentre prospective observational study of patients who underwent radiotherapy between November 2020 and January 2023. The cohort comprised patients with solid tumours that were oligoprogressive in response to ICI administration. No clear consensus existed on the definition of oligoprogressive disease when this study was designed. Therefore, oligoprogressive disease was defined as a\u2009<\u200920% increase in lesions compared to\u2009>\u20092\u00a0months before enrolment, which implies categorising it within the stable disease category. Other eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) age at enrolment\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0years; (2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0\u20132; (3) expected survival\u2009\u2265\u20093\u00a0months; (4) diagnosis of solid tumour (excluding haematological disease) and receiving ICI; (5) irradiated target with a long (total) diameter\u2009\u2265\u20093\u00a0cm; and (6)\u2009>\u20091 lesion, other than the irradiated target, being evaluated. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) multiple cancers (concurrent overlapping cancers or iatrogenic overlapping cancers with a disease-free interval of\u2009\u2264\u20095\u00a0years); (2) stroke, cerebral haemorrhage or myocardial infarction within 6\u00a0months before enrolment; (3) autoimmune disease (excluding type I diabetes, manageable thyroid disease and skin disease); (4) use of immunosuppressive drugs or adrenal corticosteroids (prednisolone equivalent\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0mg/d); (5) measurable lesions after radiotherapy were brain lesions only or skin lesions only; (6) planned to discontinue ICI after radiotherapy; and (7) history of irradiation at the same site as the present case (re-irradiation). Patients who requested radiotherapy and met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were included in the analysis. As this was an exploratory observational study, the study size was determined based on the number of patients expected to be included in the timeframe.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Aichi Medical University Hospital in Japan (application number 2020\u2013147), Anjo Kosei Hospital, and Toyota Memorial Hospital with an opt-out approach regarding the analysis before this study. This study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.Immunotherapy and radiotherapyICIs included anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) as a mainstay. Anti-PD-1 antibodies were administered alone or in combination with other types of ICIs or systemic therapy. Any number of pretreatment systemic therapy lines could be used; however, as stated in the eligibility criteria, at least 2\u00a0months had to elapse between the start of ICI administration and that of radiotherapy. The treatment schedule followed a standard regimen for each disease. If grade 2 toxicity was observed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), the administration was suspended until the patient recovered to grade 1. We terminated administration in cases of serious adverse events, such as grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 toxicity or confirmed overt progressive disease (PD), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1.Radiotherapy was administered during the rest period, ensuring avoidance of concurrent ICI administration. We used 6- or 10-MV X-rays from linear accelerators in all cases. Although dose fractionation was determined by the physician in charge, considering clinical information, such as target size and location, all patients underwent hypofractionated radiotherapy to ensure that irradiation was completed during the rest period. Patients were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy.Outcome evaluationThe primary endpoint was the rate of the AE. An AE was considered present if at least one of the non-irradiated lesions decreased by at least 30% by the time the disease was classified as PD (i.e. before the next line of systemic therapy began). The secondary endpoints were irradiation completion rate, local effect, 1-year overall survival (OS) rate, 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and toxicity rate. Local effects of the irradiated area were assessed objectively by a physician based on RECIST after 3\u00a0months (range: 2\u20134\u00a0months), and those with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were considered responders. In addition, patients subjectively rated whether there was an improvement in pain relief. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE version 5.0. We measured the time from the date of initiation of radiotherapy to the event. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was classified according to the tumour proportion score as strongly positive (\u2265\u200950%), positive (1\u201349%), negative (<\u20091%) or unknown. These classifications were based on existing data measured on explanted specimens or biopsy results, irrespective of the site to be irradiated. Only one patient had received systemic therapy before sample collection.Statistical analysesAll statistical analyses were performed using EZR version 1.55 (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan) based on R and R Commander. Patient characteristics were compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and Student\u2019s t-test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables.

ICI immune checkpoint inhibitor, RT radiotherapy, AE abscopal effectTwelve Japanese patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom six (50%) had AEs. The median time from irradiation to AE confirmation was 4 (range 2\u20139) months. Table 1 summarises patient characteristics grouped according to the presence or absence of the AE. The most common primary disease was lung cancer, and the histological type was adenocarcinoma, with bone and lymph node irradiation for pain relief in most cases. The univariate analysis revealed no factors that significantly contributed to the occurrence of the AE. For immunohistochemistry of PD-L1, the 22C3 pharmDx assay was used, except in one melanoma case for which the 28\u20138 pharmDx assay was used. All three patients with strongly positive PD-L1 expression had AEs, whereas the three patients with negative PD-L1 expression did not. The AE group had predominantly male (p\u2009=\u20090.061) patients and had higher baseline white blood cell counts (p\u2009=\u20090.093). Table 2 shows details of the case-specific PD-L1 expression and treatment. The clinical course of each patient, starting with the administration of the ICI, is shown in Fig.\u00a01.Typical examples of the AECase 1CT image of case 1. a Left inguinal lymph node before radiotherapy; b left inguinal lymph node 2\u00a0months after radiotherapy; c left iliac lymph node before radiotherapy (unirradiated assessment lesion); and d left iliac lymph node 4\u00a0months after radiotherapy (unirradiated assessment lesion). White arrow, tumour; CT computed tomographyAn 83-year-old male patient was diagnosed with large-cell lung cancer. Owing to the presence of multiple distant metastases from the time of diagnosis, pembrolizumab (200\u00a0mg/body/3\u00a0weeks) was used as the first-line treatment. Four months after treatment initiation, the patient requested radiotherapy owing to increasing pain from the left inguinal lymph node metastasis despite a mild increase shown on imaging (Fig.\u00a02a). Palliative radiotherapy was performed with 30\u00a0Gy/5 fractions. Two months later, the left inguinal lymph node metastasis decreased in size, and the pain disappeared (Fig.\u00a02b). Pembrolizumab treatment continued, and another imaging scan 2\u00a0months later showed a marked reduction in unirradiated left iliac lymph nodes (Fig.\u00a02c and d).Case 2CT and PET/CT images of case 2. a Left primary lung lesion before radiotherapy; b left primary lung lesion 3\u00a0months after radiotherapy; c mediastinal lymph node before radiotherapy (unirradiated assessment lesion); d mediastinal lymph node 6\u00a0months after radiotherapy (unirradiated assessment lesion); e left primary lung lesion 1\u00a0year and 10\u00a0months after radiotherapy; and f left primary lung lesion 1\u00a0year and 10\u00a0months after radiotherapy (PET/CT). White arrow, tumour; CT computed tomography, PET positron emission tomographyAn 82-year-old male patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. He had brain metastases at diagnosis; therefore, pembrolizumab (200\u00a0mg/body/3\u00a0weeks) was used as a first-line treatment after stereotactic radiotherapy to the brain. Pembrolizumab was effective and continued long term; however, after 1\u00a0year, the tumours grew slowly, particularly in the primary left upper lobe lesion. One year and 5\u00a0months after the start of pembrolizumab treatment, radiotherapy was performed on the left primary lung lesion with 35\u00a0Gy/5 fractions to reduce the volume (Fig.\u00a03a). Three months after irradiation, the primary lesion shrunk (Fig.\u00a03b). Simultaneously, pembrolizumab treatment was discontinued because of the presence of grade 2 radiation pneumonitis, which resolved mildly after a short course of steroids. However, pembrolizumab treatment was not restarted and was terminated after a follow-up visit 3\u00a0months later because the non-irradiated mediastinal lymph node metastases and other lesions decreased or disappeared (Fig.\u00a03c and d). One year and 10\u00a0months after irradiation, the primary lesion had enlarged again (Fig.\u00a03e), and positron emission tomography revealed uptake (Fig.\u00a03f). A thoracoscopic left upper quadrant resection was performed as no other noteworthy lesions were found, although recurrence was considered likely. However, the pathological results showed only necrosis and fibrosis with no malignancy, indicating that this was a pseudoprogression following radiotherapy. The patient was alive without treatment or progression on the last observation date (2\u00a0years and 3\u00a0months after irradiation).Secondary endpoint outcomesKaplan\u2013Meier curves for OS (A) and PFS (B) in the patient groups separated by AEs. OS overall survival, PFS progression-free survival, AE abscopal effectAll 12 (100%) patients completed radiotherapy. The number of responders at 3\u00a0months (median) post-irradiation was nine (75%; CR, one case; PR, eight cases). Palliative effects were achieved in all seven cases where radiotherapy was performed for pain relief. Survival curves are shown in Fig.\u00a04. Patients in the AE group had a significantly better 1-year PFS than those in the non-AE group (80.0% vs 0.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.008). Although the difference was not significant, the 1-year OS was better in patients in the AE group (100.0% vs 75.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.104). Two patients in the non-AE group died during the last follow-up. Of the remaining 10 patients, two from the AE group were untreated and progression-free.Grade 2 toxicity was observed in four (33%) patients: three in the AE group and one in the non-AE group. Two patients had radiotherapy-related pneumonia and oesophagitis, whereas the remaining two had ICI-related pneumonia and enteritis. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were observed in any category.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the incidence of AEs as a primary endpoint when irradiating Japanese patients with oligoprogressive tumours during ICI therapy. In six of the 12 (50%) patients, AEs were identified, implying that lesions outside the radiation field showed volume reduction. Patients in the AE group had a significantly better 1-year PFS than those in the non-AE group (p\u2009=\u20090.008), and two patients were untreated, with PFS, at the end of follow-up. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were found during the observation period.Although the role of radiotherapy in advanced cancer has been limited to palliation, its indications have expanded recently. Oligometastatic disease, which generally presents with fewer than five metastases, is a prime candidate. Radiotherapy for oligometastatic disease is largely beneficial for improving prognosis. Recently, oligoprogressive disease has gained attention as the next target for radiotherapy. Kim et al. conducted a systematic review of eight prospective trials on the local treatment of oligoprogressive disease. An analysis of 290 patients showed that there may be a benefit of adding local treatment to systemic treatment for lung, prostate and kidney cancers. Particularly, a study on non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated that stereotactic radiotherapy improved PFS and OS compared to systemic therapy alone. Another study focused on the combination of ICI and radiotherapy in patients with oligoprogressive disease. Chicas-Sett et al. conducted an observational study of stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma that progressed despite anti-PD-1 antibodies. The primary endpoint in 50 patients was an objective response rate of 42%, with a good median PFS (14.2\u00a0months) and median OS after stereotactic body radiation therapy (37.4\u00a0months). Our results are similar to those of their report in that the AEs of radiotherapy improved PFS and played a role in delaying the new systemic treatment line. We believe that our results will help formulate hypotheses for future randomised controlled trials of oligoprogressive disease.Although this study showed an AE rate of 50%, it was difficult to determine whether this number was high, as the definition of the AE varies slightly from study to study and is not well established. Previous studies reported considerable heterogeneity regarding design, inclusion criteria and treatment variables. This point is reported in detail with historical background as drawbacks in defining AEs by Demaria et al.. We should be particularly careful when interpreting trials where ICI and radiotherapy are concurrently initiated. In this case, lesion reduction outside the irradiated field may reflect the effect of ICI therapy and thus overestimate the AEs. Demaria et al. advocate for a combination with radiotherapy in patients who do not respond to immunotherapy alone as one approach to correctly target AEs. In this study, the rate of AE was assessed accordingly. Taking this important issue into account, our survey of previous reports of combined ICI and radiotherapy showed a median AE rate of approximately 25% (range 0\u201365%). Therefore, we believe that the oligoprogressive diseases on which we focused are relatively promising targets for the AE.Combining another predictor with oligoprogressive disease status may further increase the expected AE value. Numerous potential predictors have been addressed in previous reports. However, predictors of the AE have not been established, and no statistically significant factors were found in this study. Although a retrospective study reported that lymphocyte count is a predictor of AEs, this study did not show the same result. We interpret this as lymphocyte counts being susceptible to other factors, such as infection. A few previous studies have focused on PD-L1 expression and AEs. For example, Yaguchi et al. reported that a patient with lung cancer who was strongly positive for PD-L1 had almost complete resolution of lesions, including non-irradiated areas, after radiotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Notably, in our study, all three strongly positive patients also experienced AEs, and all three negative patients experienced no AEs, although this indicated no significant difference. Some scholars have argued that PD-L1 expression alone has limitations in successfully predicting, as it may also indicate T-cell exhaustion and thus reduced systemic efficacy. Therefore, further research is required to establish predictive factors.Our study was limited by its non-interventional nature, lack of a control group and small sample size. Notably, this study\u2019s definition of oligoprogressive disease did not always correspond to that used in previous studies. Recently, the American Radium Society suggested a definition of oligoprogression as\u2009\u2264\u20093 discrete areas of progression in non-small cell lung cancer in prior or ongoing systemic therapy. Although it may require considerable time to reach a consensus on definitions for all cancer types and to coordinate opinions with other associations, future clinical trials should consider these recommendations. Another limitation is the possibility of including pseudoprogression after ICI treatment in eligible patients. Pseudoprogression after ICI administration occurs in a small percentage of cases, sometimes with a delayed onset of shrinkage after several months. Although this study enrolled patients\u2009>\u20092\u00a0months after the initiation of ICI therapy for compatibility with iRECIST, we recognised that pseudoprogression is a limitation that cannot be excluded in AE studies.In conclusion, irradiation of solid tumours showing oligoprogression during ongoing ICI therapy appears promising, as AEs were expected in 50% of the patients. Patients with AEs show improved PFS and sometimes achieve long-term PFS after the completion of ICI therapy. We believe that our results advance the study of AEs and provide a cornerstone for improving the prognosis of patients with advanced cancers.Publisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsAll authors contributed to the study\u2019s conception and design.

        "content": "Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of the tumor stroma. Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel <sup99m</supTc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 \u00b1 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (<in</i = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (<in</i = 1); and breast (<in</i = 21), lung (<in</i = 2), colorectal (<in</i = 1) and cervical (<in</i = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [<sup18</supF]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 \u00b1 63 MBq). The total lesions (<in</i = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III-IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP and [<sup18</supF]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [<sup18</supF]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)). Peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer were only visualized with [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP.

Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel 99mTc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 \u00b1 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (n = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1); and breast (n = 21), lung (n = 2), colorectal (n = 1) and cervical (n = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [18F]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [99mTc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 \u00b1 63 MBq). The total lesions (n = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [18F]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)). Peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer were only visualized with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. In patients with breast cancer, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated among [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake values (Bq/cm3) of PT and the molecular subtype, being higher for subtypes HER2+ and Luminal B HER2-enriched. Four different CAF subpopulations have previously been described for LNm of breast cancer (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1, which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2 and triple-negative), confirming that FAP+ is a marker for poor disease prognosis. The results of this pilot clinical research show that [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT imaging is a promising tool in the prognostic assessment of some solid tumors, particularly breast cancer.1. IntroductionTumors are pathological complexes composed of tumor cells and the tumor stroma or tumor microenvironment (TME), which consists of cellular and acellular components, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), macrophages, blood vessels, pericytes, and extracellular matrices (ECM). In fact, CAFs induce a cancer phenotype and are responsible for the production of proteolytic enzymes, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. CAFs contribute up to 90% of the macroscopic tumor mass, provide mechanical support to tumor cells and control their survival, metastasis, proliferation, and resistance to therapies. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts and epithelial/endothelial cells, and adipocytes and pericytes that transdifferentiate to mesenchymal cells; therefore, they represent a heterogeneous cell population within the TME.Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a membrane-anchored peptidase expressed by CAFs at the stromal level of various tumor entities and contributes to progression and a worse prognosis. FAP degrades denatured collagens and participates in tumor growth via a non-enzymatic mechanism.Diagnostic FAP inhibitor radiotracers under clinical evaluation use 18F and 68Ga linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine and cyclo-[benzene(trimethanethiol-DOTA)-Met-Pro-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Met] (FAPI-2286) structures, which are radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography), and only one work has reported 99mTc, also linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine for SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging. Internationally, the amount of equipment available for molecular imaging studies is predominantly higher for gamma cameras (SPECT modality), and they represent more than 70% of the total. For SPECT images, the most-employed radionuclide is 99mTc. Therefore, the need for target-specific radiopharmaceuticals labeled with 99mTc is increasing within the field of oncology. Our group previously reported [99mTc]Tc-((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl) boronic acid ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP) as a new SPECT radioligand capable of specifically detecting FAP expressed by CAFs located in the cancer stroma and, to our knowledge, the first ligand based on 99mTc-labeled boron-Pro derivatives. Furthermore, the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP biokinetic\u2013dosimetric evaluation in healthy volunteers and three cancer patients diagnosed with breast, lung, and cervical cancer showed favorable biokinetics and uptake in primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases, achieving high-quality and high-contrast molecular images.This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity.2. ResultsNo adverse events related to the diagnostic use of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP were observed. Table 1 shows the general characteristics of patients included in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging evaluation. A detailed cancer staging of patients is shown in Table A1 (Appendix A). Patient imaging results were categorized into two groups. Patients with gliomas (n = 5), with which SPECT and SPECT/MR images were acquired, were identified as the first group. The second group involves all cases (n = 27) of breast, lung, colon, NET, renal cortex, and cervical cancer, in which SPECT/CT and PET/CT images were obtained.[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas (T/Bc range 6.3\u201313.9) (Table 2) and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma (Figure 1). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging resolution and contrast were good enough for the high-grade glioma, which could allow the performing of non-invasive diagnoses to differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas based on their distinct FAP expression. For all cancer cases, a total of 111 lesions were evaluated, which were classified as primary tumors (PT)(n = 26), lymph node metastases (LNm) (n = 61), and distant metastases (Dm) (n = 24) (Table 3). All primary tumors were detected with both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and [18F]FDG PET/CT (Figure 2 and Figure 3), which did not occur with LNm and Dm lesions (Figure 4 and Figure 5). That is, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT detected PT (100%), LNm (51%), and Dm (17%) in contrast to [18F]FDG PET/CT, which detected PT (100%), LNm (100%), and Dm (88%) (Table 3). The non-detection of LNm and Dm with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP could be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), including those not detected in NT and lung cancer, but not in 39% of the lesions with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Additionally, none of the Dm lesions detected by [18F]FDG in patients with triple negative and luminal B HER2+ molecular subtypes at the bone, liver, and lung exhibited [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake.These results are expected since FAP expression decreases once the cells succeed to invade. FAP is a protein that promotes metastasis; therefore, once the micrometastasis is established in a distant site from the PT, it loses its FAP expression. The signaling mediated by FAP/integrins/PI3K has a negative effect on IGF2 expression (associated with increased glucose uptake). This fact probably explains why as FAP uptake in Dm decreases, FDG uptake increases. As a unique feature of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP images, a very low background was achieved as previously reported (Figure 3). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake was considerably lower regarding [18F]FDG in patients with cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the adrenal cortex, which agrees with their relatively low FAP expression in comparison to lung and breast cancer (Figure 2). In general, the Dm lesions detected with [18F]FDG did not show [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, except for peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in recurrent colorectal cancer, which only showed [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, but not [18F]FDG uptake (Figure 5). CAFs are abundant in mesothelial metastases, and, through the mesothelial-mesenchymal transformation mechanism, it is likely that in carcinomatosis there is a greater transdifferentiation of mesenchymal cells towards CAFs FAP+.When comparing the values obtained from the average tumor-to-background ratios of the different background sites [T/Bm (tumor/mediastinum), T/Bl (tumor/liver) and T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle)] for all lesions, the highest values were T/Bp for both imaging methods (Figure 6). Although no statistically significant difference was found, the values of the T/Bp ratios were higher with [18F]FDG than with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (Figure 6). In the T/B data, the same trend is observed in terms of a higher uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the primary tumors compared to that obtained in the lymph node and distant metastases (Figure 6).In the case of breast cancer, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP showed a significant positive correlation between the T/Bp value of the primary tumors and the molecular subtype (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8085), where HER2+ and Luminal B HER2+ enriched subtypes showed the highest T/Bp ratios (Figure 7). The [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in HER2+ could be associated to the Erb2-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr654 of \u03b2-catenin, which promotes the activation of Wnt signaling pathways and the consequent promotion of the tumor invasive capacity (FAP expression) through a very common mechanism in breast cancer, the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, induced by the microenvironment, which infers the gain of invasive capacity and the arrest of the cell cycle, while, at the signaling level, it implies the repression of E-cadherin expression through snail/slug. In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp ratio was observed and there was no significant correlation among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027) (Figure 7). 3. DiscussionThe expression of FAP is an indication that the cell is expressing an invasive phenotype associated with an intense process of differentiation, typical of the first stages of carcinogenesis. During this phase, there is an intense activation of signaling pathways aimed at promoting the differentiation of cell precursors towards the activated fibroblast phenotype. As the tumor evolves, the stroma changes genetically and epigenetically to generate the appropriate niche for its stage. Cellular plasticity allows cells to adapt to their microenvironment through reprogramming processes (phenotypic and genotypic modifications) for tumor progression. RNAs produce epigenetic modifications that alter transcription, activating stem cell transformation and EMT processes (including FAP expression), which are essential for invasion to occur. FAP is overexpressed by CAFs from various tumor entities, making it a promising biomarker and target for many medical interventions. CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4) are classified depending on the expression of six markers: integrin b1/CD29, \u03b1-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+).In their study, Kratochwil et al. demonstrated the elevated and selective uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-04 in the stroma of multiple tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and NET cancer. However, this research demonstrated the tumor stroma imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP as the first SPECT radioligand based on a boron-Pro derivative.The results showed that the detection of primary tumor lesions with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is consistent when compared with [18F]FDG. However, when detecting LNm and Dm, the superiority of [18F]FDG is clear. This fact can be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), but not in 39% of the tumors with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Thus, our findings are discussed from the perspective of tumor stroma heterogeneity in lesions with enough size to be detected by SPECT. As mentioned, the dynamics of differentiation in the tumor microenvironment are attributed to genetic and non-genetic changes in tumor cells, the composition of the extracellular matrix, cell\u2013cell interactions, and cell heterogeneity. Based on this, it is likely that the increased uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP by primary tumors due to the presence of increased amounts of CAF-S1 FAP+ indicates an active EMT process, which is known to happen in the early phases of carcinogenesis, through which the dissemination of cells from the primary mass to distant sites is promoted. EMT involves the regulation of both intercellular adhesions by decreasing E-cadherin and increasing N-cadherin, as well as substrate adhesions through integrin mediated primarily by TGF-B, \u03b2-catenin, and the Wnt signaling pathway.On the other hand, hypoxic and hypoglycemic tumor stroma synergistically promotes the EMT phenotype in carcinomas. Thus, tumors where GLUT1 expression is commonly increased will also have an inability to express an (invasive) EMT phenotype. Accordingly, it is likely that the lack of uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in LNm and Dm is related to the fact that in this type of lesion there is an increase in the expression of GLUT1 receptors that leads to an increase in glucose metabolism, which produces a rise in the uptake of [18F]FDG and, at the same time, inhibits EMT (including FAP expression). The neoplasm with the largest number of patients in this study was breast cancer, which showed a significant positive correlation in PT between the T/Bp value and the molecular subtypes, with the highest T/Bp ratios for the HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes HER2+. The T/Bp values in HER2+ breast cancer showed a significant decrease in the LN metastases regarding PT (Figure 7), which may be due to crosstalking (cross-regulation), which occurs between integrins and EGFR receptors, such as HER2. Additionally, it is known that the Wnt signaling pathway promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in a HER2-dependent manner. It was recently confirmed that the expression of HER2 in the cell membrane is heterogeneous and that the accumulation of HER2 occurs in regions where adhesion to the extracellular matrix is dynamic. Therefore, HER2 expression decreases in regions where focal adhesions are concentrated, and the relative local decrease in HER2 expression in LNm, compared to PT, is probably related to the metastatic process. As a relevant point, it is noted that the presence of CAFs in the tumor stroma of breast cancer is associated with resistance to immunotherapy, since the elements secreted by CAFs derived from HER2+ tumors regulate resistance to treatment in a paracrine way. Thus, the decrease in [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake by LNm could indicate greater sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment.Highly-relevant data have been reported on axillary LNm in breast cancer: (1) the stroma represents around 25\u201330% of the invaded areas (regardless of subtype); (2) the predominant CAF subpopulations are CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (the latter being the most abundant); (3) CAFs enrichments are different in LNm compared to PT; (4) the secretion of CXCL12\u03b2 by CAF-S1 and the expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells is involved in the initiation of EMT and in the distant metastatic process, particularly in lung and bone; and (5) the global stromal content in LNm provides a prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients and, therefore, the CAF-S1/CAF-S4 abundance status exhibits a prognostic value, since both present pro-invasive properties with different modes of action; however, CAF-S4 is known to have a greater impact on distant metastatic spread (Dm), particularly on the liver.CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12\u03b2, promoting the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the cell differentiation into CD25+FOXP3+ cells. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells is also enhanced by CAF-S1. CAF-S4 is highly contractile and induces cancer cell invasion in three dimensions through Notch signaling. CAF-S1 FAP+ is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2+ and triple negative), confirming that FAP+ is a poor prognostic marker.Summarizing, the relatively low performance of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in detecting LNm and Dm may be related to the molecular biology of cancer and the proportion of the enrichment of CAF-S1 FAP+, which is not the most abundant in metastatic lesions (LN or distant) (Figure 8). Even when the FAP expression is associated with a phenotype that tends to transmigration and proliferation, attention must be placed on the fact that its expression is temporary and that it depends largely on the tumor microenvironment dynamics; thus, when the characteristics of the tumor stroma are modified, FAP expression and cancer prognosis can change.Our results differ from the work of K\u00f6mek et al., where they showed that PET/CT [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 is superior to [18F]FDG in the detection of primary mammary lesions and metastases (ganglionic and visceral) in twenty patients with breast cancer, both in primary and recurrent lesions, although the average size of the evaluated LNm was 10 mm. On the other hand, Backhaus et al. evaluated the use of PET/MRI with the ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT in 19 women with breast cancer with evidence of high uptake in the primary lesions (mean diameter of 26 mm) and LNm (average diameter of 21 mm). Our results probably vary from the previous research carried out due to the heterogeneity of the sample with respect to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, the image acquisition time, and the different image acquisition method (SPECT/CT vs. PET/CT vs. PET/MRI). The dynamic behavior of FAP is firmly associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution (tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, the promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation), which deserves to be used as a tool for the detection of the heterogeneity of the tumor stroma in the different stages of cancer through molecular imaging with specific radiotracers, such as [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. Therefore, additional clinical studies must be performed, including the results of the ex vivo FAP expression in tumors (immunohistochemical evaluation) to be correlated with the uptake of FAP inhibitory radiotracers. Today, CAFs is receiving considerable attention in the field of cancer biology. Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic targeting of FAP has been described in different modalities, such as vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles. In preclinical studies, CAF-S1 FAP+ has shown to cause resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduce antitumor immunity. CAFs from breast, ovarian, lung, pancreas, and colon cancer have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2; particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset. Additionally, the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.Taking into account the deleterious effect of metastases on the survival of breast cancer patients, our data could heighten the interest in evaluating the abundance of the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation, in vivo, in a non-invasive manner, by means of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT in axillary LNm during the initial clinical approach (staging) to determine the prognosis and the benefit of therapies, such as anti-FAP, anti-TGF\u03b2, anti-CXCR4, and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, in combination with standard therapies (Figure 8). More prospective research is needed to enrich the information obtained so far and we believe that future research can be focused on the function of FAP ligands in different molecular and histological subtypes of breast cancer, as well as their potential in detecting relapse of the disease, in the evaluation of the response to therapy and the prognosis of the patient.Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a complication of various malignant tumors and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. The superiority of uptake by [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in peritoneal carcinomatosis, due to recurrent colon cancer observed in the patient included in this study, agrees with the findings previously described, demonstrating a greater sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 for the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with various types of cancer.The findings observed in patients with glioma coincide with the data previously reported by R\u00f6hrich et al., where they showed little or no uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 in low-grade WHO II gliomas and high uptake in gliomas of high WHO III-IV grade, regardless of HDI status; therefore, its usefulness could lie mainly in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus post-treatment changes and in surgical and/or radiotherapy planning, for which more prospective studies are needed in this regard.4. Materials and Methods4.1. ReagentsAn iFAP (boron-Pro ligand) lyophilized kit for 99mTc labeling was obtained from the National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico) with GMP certification. [99mTc]TcO4Na was eluted from a generator (99Mo/99mTc GETEC, ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico). Other reagents were received from Millipore Co. (Burlington, MA, USA). 4.2. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP PreparationAfter the reconstitution of the iFAP lyophilized kit with a [99mTc]TcO4Na/0.2 M phosphate buffer (1:1 v/v, 2 mL, 740 MBq) solution and incubation in a block heater (92 \u00b0C, 15 min), the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP radioligand was obtained with a radiochemical purity (R.P.) greater than 98% (HPLC, Discovery C18 column, 5 \u00b5m particle size, I.D. of 0.46 cm, length of 25 cm; Supelco, Millipore, Burling-ton, MA, USA; coupled to a UV\u2013Vis detector and a radiometric detector), applying the following linear gradient: a flow rate of 1 mL/min, 0.1% TFA/water (A) (from 100 to 50%, over 10 min, maintained for 10 min, 30% over 5 min, and returned to 100% over 5 min) and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile (B). As previously reported, the lyophilized formulation contains the HYNIC-iFAP (((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)boronic) ligand with a specific alignment to the corresponding regions of the FAP binding site, stannous chloride as a reducing agent, as well as ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) to complete the coordination sphere of the [Tc(V)]HYNIC core (Figure 9).The chemical characterization of the iFAP ligand included analysis by mass spectrometry (UPLC-mass), 1H\u2013NMR, UV\u2013Vis and FT-IR. Radiochemical characterization included reversed-phase radio-HPLC and ITLC-SG (instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel) with the following mobile phases: 2-butanone, 0.1 M sodium citrate, and ammonium acetate-methanol (1:1 v/v), as reported in detail previously.4.3. PatientsThirty-two patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 50.8 \u00b1 16.7 years; 28 women and 4 men) with different types of cancer (breast cancer (n = 21), lung cancer (n = 2), adrenal cortex NETs (n = 1), colorectal cancer (n = 1), cervical cancer (n = 3) and gliomas (n = 5)) were included.The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n = 5 gliomas) and Group 2 (n = 27 breast, lung, colon, renal cortex NET, and cervical cancer). The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and with a detailed clinical description in Appendix A (Table A1). All oncological diagnoses were determined histopathologically (Table 2).The patients underwent SPECT/CT 1\u20133 h (with an average of 2 h) after the intravenous application of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5MBq). In Group 1, only of the brain region, and in Group 2, the thoracoabdominal region. The tumor/background ratio is optimal for diagnostic images from 30 min post-injection. However, it was decided 2 h after radiotracer administration to improve the contrast of the images (lesions vs. background). The acquisition protocol and the post-injection waiting time were the same for all types of cancer evaluated. However, in patients with cervical cancer or pelvic etiology, immediate image acquisition was performed post-micturition to reduce the artifact of radiotracer accumulation in the urine.All patients in Group 1 had previous cranial MRI (6 \u00b1 1 days interval) and patients in Group 2 had previous [18F]FDG PET/CT studies carried out (11 \u00b1 12.6 days interval).This research was performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the National Cancer Institute (INCan), Mexico. The patients signed an informed consent declaration, and the protocol was approved by the institutional Nuclear Medicine Ethics Committee. 4.4. Image Acquisition[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT images were acquired with a dual-head gamma camera (SPECT/CT, Symbia TruePoint, Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA), with low-energy, high-resolution collimators; parameters: window at 140 keV, matrix size of 128 \u00d7 128, with dispersion correction, 90 images of 8 s, rotation of 360 degrees. For the attenuation correction map, the low-dose CT parameters were obtained. A Butterworth filter (cutoff: 0.5, 5th order) and an iterative method (8 iterations /4 subsets) were used for the reconstruction of the raw data.SPECT/CT images were acquired 2 h after the intravenous administration of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5 MBq). The anatomical region studied in Group 1 was only the brain and in Group 2 it was thoracoabdominal. Activity in regions of interest was quantified, via 3D imaging, as Bq/cm3.All patients in Group 2 had undergone a prior PET/CT (Excel 20) scan (Siemens Medical Solutions), performed at 1 h after [18F]FDG administration (CT: slice thickness of 5 mm, 180 mAs and 120 kVp). Whole-body scans were obtained in 3D mode from the vertex to mid-thighs (2\u20133 min per bed position). PET images were reconstructed using a two-dimensional expectation algorithm of ordered subsets.4.5. Image AnalysisImages obtained with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG were examined on a Siemens VG60 multimodal workstation. Visual and semi-quantitative analyses were performed by two physicians with more than 9 years of experience in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (workstation with processing software for volumetric analysis).Visual analysis was performed on both groups of patients. Uptake was compared with the morphology of the corresponding lesion using CT and/or MRI, depending on the patient group. The detected lesions were divided into three categories for study: primary tumor (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). The semiquantitative analysis of lesion uptake was obtained by calculating the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B) with spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) to homogenize the data obtained with both radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, in Group 2, the concordance of uptake between both radiotracers was compared by quantifying the number of lesions (PT, LNm, and Dm).4.6. Tumor Tissue SamplesAll patients underwent a biopsy of the primary tumor lesion. Histopathology was used to determine the existence of viable tumor tissue and to verify the diagnosis. The histopathological reports were interpreted by a certified and experienced pathologist.4.7. Statistical AnalysisThe Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the T/Bp [99mTc]Tc-iFAP values and the molecular subtypes of the patients with breast cancer; a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.5. ConclusionsThe results of this pilot study show that SPECT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is a promising and potentially useful tool in the evaluation of the tumor microenvironment of multiple solid neoplastic entities. Within the different types of cancer that we included, we observed a potential panorama in the prognostic evaluation of recently diagnosed breast cancer, as well as its probable diagnostic superiority in peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent colon cancer. [18F]FDG was superior to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the detection of LNm and Dm. However, with the analyses carried out, we can establish that the role of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is not to displace metabolic molecular imaging, but rather that it serves as a complement for an adequate prognostic evaluation.Further prospective [99mTc]Tc-iFAP clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization, G.F.-F., P.V.-A., E.A.-V. and M.L.-G.; methodology, P.V.-A., M.L.-G., P.C.-T. and B.S.-B.; formal analysis, P.V.-A., C.S.-C., G.F.-F., F.O.G.-P., B.O.-G. and E.A.-V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.V.-A. and G.F.-F.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.F.-F.; funding acquisition, M.L.-G. and C.S.-C.

Note the adequate visualization of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in high-grade gliomas (WHO III-IV)-treatment-naive and recurrent (R). However, low-grade glioma (WHO II) did not show uptake.(a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and (b) [18F]FDG PET/CT images of the primary tumors of three different types of cancers. All primary lesions show concordant uptake between both molecular imaging methods. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake was considerably lower regarding [18F]FDG in patients with cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the adrenal cortex.Primary breast cancer tumors. (a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP MIP, (b) [18F]FDG MIP, (c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT, and (d) [18F]FDG PET/CT. All primary lesions show concordant uptake between both molecular imaging methods. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake is decreased in pure hormonal molecular subtypes (Luminal A and B) and elevated in subtypes with HER2+ expression (Luminal B HER2+ and pure HER2+). The triple negative subtype shows moderate and heterogeneous uptake. MIP: maximum intensity projection.Lymph node metastases in breast cancer. (a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/T and (b) [18F]FDG PET/CT. All malignant-appearing axillary lymphadenopathies are hypermetabolic; however, most of them (arrowheads) exhibit reduced or absent [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in all molecular subtypes of breast cancer (lesion sizes >8 mm).Distant metastases in various types of cancers. (a,c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and (b,d) [18F]FDG PET/CT. All distant metastatic lesions are hypermetabolic; however, most of them (arrowhead) exhibit decreased or no uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. In the case of the patient with recurrent colon cancer, areas of diffuse [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake were observed in liver subcapsular implants and in the anterior abdominal wall, which were not detected with [18F]FDG. BC: breast cancer. R: recurrence.Box plot of the target-to-background ratios of (a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and (b) [18F]F-FDG in all primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases (except gliomas).The T/Bp ratio is higher in all categories of both radiotracers, particularly in the primary tumor. T/Bm (tumor/mediastinum), T/Bl (tumor/liver), and T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle).  mode.Box plot of the T/Bp ratio of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in primary tumors and LN metastases of breast cancer. In primary tumors, the T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle) ratio is higher in HER2+ and Luminal B HER2+ molecular subtypes. In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp is observed and there is no significant difference among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027).  mode and \u00b0 = outliers.CAF subpopulations as prognostic markers in breast cancer (in diagnosis). Four CAF subpopulations have been reported in the lymph node metastases of breast cancer (CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The most relevant and predominant are CAF-S1 FAP+ and CAF-S4 FAP-. Pelon et al. established a model of clinical application to the knowledge generated from the different subpopulations, in such a way that a prognostic impact is proposed according to the predominance of CAFs as follows: if at the time of diagnosis the patient exhibits low content of CAF-S1 FAP+ in LNm, they present a low risk of late Dm ((a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-), no uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal A breast cancer); on the other hand, if high levels of CAF-S1 FAP+ are demonstrated in LNm, the risk of distant metastasis increases ((b) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(+), uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal B HER2+ breast cancer). Finally, in distant metastatic lesions, only CAF-S4 FAP- is expressed [(c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-) in lung Dm and extremely low uptake in some right axillary lymph nodes that exhibit hypermetabolism with [18F]FDG; likewise, (d) multiple lung and liver metastases did not exhibit uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP]. BC: breast cancer, LNm: lymph node metastasis, Dm: distant metastasis.The proposed [Tc(V)]EDDA/HYNIC core structure in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP radioligand. The advantage that HYNIC-iFAP presents with respect to previously reported quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine-based FAP inhibitors is the possibility of obtaining [99mTc]Tc(V)-EDDA/HYNIC stable cores from instant freeze-dried kit formulations.General characteristics of the patients included in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging study.Characteristics\tNumber\t \tNo. patient\t32\t \tAge (years)\t50.8 \u00b1 16.7\t \tGender (%)\t\t \tFemale\t28 (88%)\t \tMale\t4 (12%)\t \tDiagnosis\tCases (%)\t \tBreast cancer\t21 (66%)\t \tDuctal carcinoma, Luminal A\t2\t \tDuctal carcinoma, Luminal B\t3\t \tDuctal carcinoma, Luminal B HER2+\t5\t \tDuctal carcinoma, HER2+\t2\t \tDuctal carcinoma, Triple negative\t9\t \tLung cancer\t2 (6%)\t \tNSCLC adenocarcinoma\t\t \tCervical cancer\t3 (9%)\t \tSquamous cell carcinoma\t\t \tGlioma\t5 (16%)\t \tAstrocytoma NOS (WHO II)\t1\t \tAnaplastic astrocytoma NOS (WHO III)\t3\t \tGlioblastoma NOS (WHO IV)\t1\t \tColorectal cancer\t1 (3%)\t \tAdenocarcinoma\t1\t \tAdrenal cortical neuroendocrine tumor\t1 (3%)\t \tPoorly differentiated, Ki67 30%\t1\t \tClinical setting (%)\t\t \tInitial staging\t27 (84%)\t \tRestaging\t5 (15%)\t \tTumor-to-contralateral tissue background ratio (T/Bc) of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in patients with high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas.Diagnosis\tStatus Brain SPECT\tT/Bc\t \tAstrocytoma NOS (WHO II)\tNegative\tNA\t \tAnaplastic astrocytoma NOS (WHO III) (n = 2)\tPositive\t6.3 and 7.8\t \tAnaplastic astrocytoma NOS restaging (WHO III)\tPositive\t15.4\t \tGlioblastoma NOS (WHO IV)\tPositive\t13.9\t \tNumber of lesions detected with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG in all patients except gliomas.\tPrimary Tumor\tLymph Node Metastases\tDistant Metastases\tTotal\t \tAll lesions (N)\t26\t61\t24\t111\t \t[99mTc]Tc-iFAP\t26 (100%)\t31 (51%)\t4 (17%)\t61 (55%)\t \t[18F]FDG\t26 (100%)\t61 (100%)\t21 (88%)\t108 (97%)\t \t\tDiagnosis\tLymph node metastases\tDistant metastases\t \t[99mTc]Tc-iFAP\t\tn = 31 (51%)\tn = 4 (17%)\t \tLung cancer NSCLC\t3\t0\t \tTriple-negative BC\t10\t0\t \tLuminal A \t0\t0\t \tLuminal B HER2+ BC\t7\t2\t \tLuminal B BC\t4\t0\t \tHER2+ BC\t5\t0\t \tCervical cancer\t2\t0\t \tColorectal cancer\t0\t3\t \tAdrenal cortical NT\t0\t1\t \t[18F]FDG\t\tn = 61 (100%)\tn = 21 (88%)\t \tLung cancer NSCLC\t3\t1\t \tTriple-negative BC\t25\t1\t \tLuminal A BC \t5\t0\t \tLuminal B HER2+ BC\t8\t16\t \tLuminal B BC\t10\t1\t \tHER2+ BC\t7\t0\t \tCervical cancer\t2\t0\t \tColorectal cancer\t0\t0\t \tAdrenal cortical NT\t1\t2\t \tBC: breast cancer; NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; NT: neuroendocrine tumor."
