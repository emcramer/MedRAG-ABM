    "## Potential Rules for CAFs and C3 **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases transform to activated from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [2] suggests that miR-9, a known metastamiR, is released by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to enhance the transition of normal fibroblasts (NFs) into cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. This rule reflects the observation that inflammatory signals can suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the immune response or other cellular processes. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases transform to M1 from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** Document [1] suggests that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). This rule reflects the observation that macrophages can be re-educated towards the M1 phenotype upon encountering dead cells. This can lead to increased tumor cell killing. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [1] suggests that GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. This rule reflects the observation that macrophages may become less motile upon encountering dead cells, potentially due to phagocytosis or other cellular processes. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [1] suggests that GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. This rule reflects the observation that macrophages may become less motile upon encountering dead cells, potentially due to phagocytosis or other cellular processes. **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [8] suggests that CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME. This rule reflects the observation that CAFs are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion. **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases secretion of pro-inflammatory factors from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [8] suggests that CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME. This rule reflects the observation that CAFs are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion. **Rule 7:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 increases secretion of anti-inflammatory factors from 0 towards 10 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [8] suggests that CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME. This rule reflects the observation that CAFs are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion. **Rule 8:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases transform to epithelial from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [1] suggests that GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. This rule reflects the observation that inflammatory signals can suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the immune response or other cellular processes. **Rule 9:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), C3 decreases transform to mesenchymal from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [1] suggests that GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. This rule reflects the observation that inflammatory signals can suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the immune response or other cellular processes. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific research question and the specific tumor model you are using. "
