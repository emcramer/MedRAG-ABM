    "I cannot provide rules for the signal \"Cd6\" because the provided documents do not contain information about this specific signal in the context of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The documents focus on various aspects of CAF biology, including: * **CAF heterogeneity and subtypes:** Documents [12, 27, 37, 39, 45, 49, 68] discuss different CAF subtypes based on markers like CD146, \u03b1-SMA, PDPN, ER\u03b136, and SPARC. * **CAF-mediated tumor progression:** Documents [11, 12, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 27, 28, 30, 33, 35, 41, 44, 45, 48, 51, 54, 55, 56, 59, 62, 67, 68, 69, 74] explore how CAFs promote tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance through various mechanisms, including cytokine secretion, ECM remodeling, and immune modulation. * **CAF-tumor cell interactions:** Documents [14, 18, 22, 26, 28, 30, 33, 38, 41, 44, 51, 54, 55, 56, 59, 62, 67, 68, 69, 74] describe how CAFs interact with tumor cells, influencing their behavior and contributing to tumor progression. * **CAF-mediated drug resistance:** Documents [9, 14, 23, 29, 30, 33, 35, 38, 41, 45, 51, 54, 55, 57, 59, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69, 74] discuss how CAFs can contribute to drug resistance in cancer cells. * **Targeting CAFs for therapy:** Documents [3, 9, 13, 20, 23, 27, 30, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 55, 57, 59, 62, 66, 67, 68, 69, 74] explore strategies for targeting CAFs for therapeutic purposes, including the use of drugs, antibodies, and nanoparticles. However, none of these documents mention \"Cd6\" as a signal or factor related to CAFs. To generate rules for your agent-based model, you need to: 1. **Identify the specific signal you want to model:** \"Cd6\" is not a known signal in the context of CAFs. You need to choose a relevant signal based on your research question and the available literature. 2. **Find relevant research papers:** Search PubMed or other databases for papers that discuss the chosen signal and its effects on CAFs. 3. **Analyze the research findings:** Carefully read the papers and extract the key findings about how the signal affects CAF behavior. 4. **Format the rules:** Use the provided format to create clear and concise rules that describe how CAFs respond to the signal. For example, if you are interested in the effect of TGF-\u03b2 on CAFs, you could find relevant papers and generate rules like: * \"In cancer-associated fibroblasts, TGF-\u03b2 increases \u03b1-SMA expression.\" (Justification: This rule reflects the known role of TGF-\u03b2 in promoting myofibroblast differentiation, which is characterized by \u03b1-SMA expression. [Document 27, 33, 41, 51, 54, 56, 62, 67, 68, 69, 74]) * \"In cancer-associated fibroblasts, TGF-\u03b2 increases collagen secretion.\" (Justification: TGF-\u03b2 is a key regulator of ECM remodeling, and it promotes collagen production by fibroblasts. [Document 20, 23, 27, 30, 33, 41, 51, 54, 56, 59, 62, 67, 68, 69, 74]) Remember to always cite the relevant documents in your justifications to support your rules. "
