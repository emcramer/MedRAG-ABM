    "## Potential Rules for Angptl4 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules for Angptl4 in CAFs, along with justifications based on the provided documents: **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, hypoxia increases Angptl4 secretion. **Justification:** Document [0] states that ANGPTL4 is a STAT3-dependent mediator of CAF pro-tumorigenic functions. Document [14] demonstrates that hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs, and that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling is involved in the regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs exposed to hypoxia. Document [20] mentions that ANGPTL4 is a HIF-1 target gene. Therefore, it is plausible that hypoxia could increase Angptl4 secretion in CAFs. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, contact with neoplastic epithelial cells increases Angptl4 secretion. **Justification:** Document [0] states that ANGPTL4 is a STAT3-dependent mediator of CAF pro-tumorigenic functions. Document [1] mentions that CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs. Document [3] suggests that TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy. Document [20] mentions that ANGPTL4 is a HIF-1 target gene. Therefore, it is plausible that contact with neoplastic epithelial cells could increase Angptl4 secretion in CAFs, potentially through the activation of STAT3 or other pathways involved in CAF activation. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, TGF-\u03b2 increases Angptl4 secretion. **Justification:** Document [20] mentions that ANGPTL4 is a HIF-1 target gene. Document [27] states that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Document [29] suggests that factors released by adipose tissue change PPAR-regulated gene expression and lipid metabolism and induce a more aggressive TNBC cell phenotype. Document [30] mentions that biglycan is correlated with TGF-\u03b2 receptor signaling. Therefore, it is plausible that TGF-\u03b2 could increase Angptl4 secretion in CAFs, potentially through the activation of HIF-1 or other pathways involved in CAF activation. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl4 decreases cell-cell adhesion. **Justification:** Document [20] states that ANGPTL4 overexpression inhibits tumor cell adhesion and migration. Therefore, it is plausible that Angptl4 could decrease cell-cell adhesion in CAFs, potentially through the modulation of ECM components or other pathways involved in cell adhesion. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl4 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Document [20] states that ANGPTL4 overexpression inhibits tumor cell adhesion and migration. Therefore, it is plausible that Angptl4 could increase migration speed in CAFs, potentially through the modulation of ECM components or other pathways involved in cell motility. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are not definitive. Further research is needed to validate these rules and to understand the precise mechanisms by which Angptl4 influences CAF behavior. "
