    "## Potential Rules for Angptl2 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl2 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Angptl2 is known to promote tumor cell migration in an autocrine/paracrine manner (Document [15]). This suggests that Angptl2 could also influence the migration of CAFs, potentially increasing their motility. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl2 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. **Justification:** Angptl2 has been shown to accelerate metastasis through enhancing tumor angiogenesis (Document [15]). This suggests that Angptl2 could also promote an inflammatory environment within the tumor microenvironment, potentially by increasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by CAFs. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl2 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Angptl2 is known to promote tumor cell migration and invasion (Document [15]). This suggests that Angptl2 could also promote the activation of CAFs, potentially by increasing their ability to produce ECM components and secrete growth factors. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl2 increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** Angptl2 is known to enhance tumor angiogenesis (Document [15]). This suggests that Angptl2 could also promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, which is associated with the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors that can suppress the immune response and promote tumor growth. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Angptl2 decreases immunogenicity to cytotoxic T cells. **Justification:** Angptl2 is known to promote tumor growth and metastasis (Document [15]). This suggests that Angptl2 could also contribute to immune evasion by reducing the immunogenicity of CAFs to cytotoxic T cells. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are not definitive. Further research is needed to validate these rules and to understand the precise mechanisms by which Angptl2 influences CAF behavior. "
