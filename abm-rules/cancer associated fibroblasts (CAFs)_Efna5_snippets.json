Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0028. (C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy).

Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B. PGE2 expression in cells; cells were exposed to 50 nM TPA for 24 h to induce COX-2 expression. C. Tumor volumes for COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 (N=5) and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=8) tumors; 2 \u00d7 106 cells were inoculated in 0.1 ml of 8.8 mg/ml Matrigel. D. Representative immunoblot showing COX-2 expression in MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors. GAPDH was used as loading control. E.

Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05; ***p \u2264 0.001 using \u0394Ct values.To evaluate functional changes in the ECM we injected the macromolecular contrast agent albumin-GdDTPA (~100 kDa) i.v. and followed its in vivo distribution noninvasively in volume-matched tumors. This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G. Representative \u03b1-SMA immunoblots obtained from an MDA-MB-231 and a Clone 13 tumor are presented in Figure 5H and demonstrate the decrease of \u03b1-SMA expression following COX-2 downregulation.Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from A.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+.

Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Significantly positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue lines, respectively. The color and size of the nodes indicate the type of cells and P values from Cox regression. Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

The resulting transformed microenvironment, also-called reactive stroma, differs from the stroma of the healthy mammary gland, showing disruptions in the fibroblast-epithelial cell cross-talk in terms of cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodelling. In particular, the migratory/invasive behaviour of tumor cells seems to be strongly influenced by this aberrant dialogue with the adjacent fibroblasts. The release of soluble factors by both kinds of cell types reciprocally influences their peculiar properties, creating suitable conditions for malignant cells not only to multiply but also to migrate and invade other tissues, outside the boundaries of the mammary gland. Fibroblasts arising from tumor stroma, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs), have acquired distinct properties mainly leading to the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Differences in the activity of NFs versus CAFs in breast tumors may result from alterations in molecular and/or cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the production and release by CAFs of a number of soluble factors such as fibroblast growth factors, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), insulin-like growth factors, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Tumorigenicity of CAFs, derived from breast tumors and injected together with malignant cells, has been widely demonstrated in animal models. Induction of mammary cancers has also been demonstrated in mice orthotopically grafted with TGF-\u03b2-and/or HGF-transfected fibroblasts co-injected with apparently normal epithelial breast cells, highlighting the critical role of heterotypic interactions in human breast development. This tumor-stroma cross-talk seems to have an important influence also in the involved lymph-node microenvironments, as demonstrated by the ability of nodal fibroblasts to affect viability, proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. At the root of the alterations in these latter activities seems to be the induction of reciprocal changes in the genomic profiles of cancer and stromal cells involving, in particular, genes critical for growth control, cell adhesion and invasiveness.Despite the growing number of studies focused on epithelial-stromal interactions in solid tumors, the role played by fibroblasts in the development and progression of breast cancer is not yet fully understood. Thus, the use of relevant co-culture models using fibroblasts derived from normal and malignant stroma may provide a practical tool for the analysis of reciprocal influences between the stroma and the epithelial tumor compartment.In the present report, we sought to gain a deeper insight into some molecular and functional properties strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastatization. These properties may be supposed to be reciprocally influenced in the epithelium-stroma cross-talk occurring in breast cancer. With this aim, we performed breast cancer cells/fibroblasts co-culture assays and analyzed changes occurring in adhesion molecule expression, membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness in both the cell types. In our experimental approach, we co-cultured estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive and low metastasizing mammary cancer cells (MCF-7) or ER-negative, highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with fibroblasts isolated from mammary healthy skin (NFs) or from breast tumor stroma (CAFs) in conventional 2D adherent cultures or in a 3D system (nodules). Results obtained were compared with those from the respective homotypic cultures.Materials and MethodsBreast cancer cell linesThe estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive, and low metastasizing human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative, highly invasive, and metastatic human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Euroclone, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone) and 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.Clinical specimens and fibroblast culturesBreast cancer tissues and their relative normal counterparts (normal mammary skin samples) were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Unit\u00e0 Operativa di Chirurgia Senologica, Facolt\u00e0 di Medicina e Chirurgia \u201cA. Gemelli\u201d, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, Italy), according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Donors gave written informed consent to participate in the study.Breast cancer and normal mammary skin tissue samples were minced into small pieces (2\u20133 mm3) and attached onto 100 mm culture dishes. Primary normal mammary skin (NFs) and cancer-associated (CAFs) fibroblasts isolated from clinical specimens were maintained in DMEM (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone), 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.The fibroblastic nature of the isolated cells was verified by microscopic determination of morphology portrait and immunocytochemical characterization using fibroblast- (anti-vimentin, V9 clone, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); epithelial tumor cell- (anti-cytokeratin 18, DC 10 clone, Dako), activated fibroblast- (anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, \u03b1-SMA, 1A4 clone, Dako), and endothelial cell- (anti-CD31, 89C2 clone, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) specific markers. NFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin but negative for all the other markers. CAFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin and \u03b1-SMA but negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31. Co-culture experiments were carried out with fibroblasts (NFs and CAFs) of passage 2\u20133 to accumulate large amounts of cells for co-cultivation while avoiding cell aging effects.3D cultures/co-culturesFor the immnunohistochemical/immunoflurescence analysis, primary fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) were directly co-cultured with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D model (nodules) as previously described. Briefly, after detachment of cell monolayers with trypsin/EDTA, the cell density was arranged to 2.5\u00d7105 cells/ml for each cell type. One ml of the cell suspension was distributed in 5-ml centrifugation tubes containing semi-solid medium (final concentration: 1\u00d7DMEM-0.5% agar-agar). Cells were spinned down onto the semi-solid medium by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min at 12\u00b0C. Most of the supernatant liquid medium was removed and the tubes incubated overnight in an incubator at 37\u00b0C. The next day, the pellets were recovered with 200 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7DMEM by gentle aspiration and transferred on 1006-Falcon Petri dishes containing 2 ml of semi-solid medium. Medium was renewed 2 days later and then after 5 days.For co-cultures, a 1\u22361 proportion of each cell type was used. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type were used as controls.After 4 or 6 days of culture, nodules were harvested for immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence analysis.2D cultures/co-culturesFor the evaluation of vimentin expression, cell membrane fluidity and migration, conventional 2D adherent cultures were used. Briefly, confluent fibroblast and breast cancer cell cultures were trypsinized and 0.5\u00d7105 cells of each cell type were plated together in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) for confocal microscopy analysis in their standard medium, which was renewed after 3 days. After for 6 days, membrane fluidity or cell migration were evaluated as described below. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type (1\u00d7105 cells) were used as controls.ImmunohistochemistryTo verify the distribution of the two cell types in 3D co-cultures, and the effects of the heterotypic interactions on fibroblast activation and cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of pankeratin, \u03b1-SMA and proliferation markers (Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) was performed on cryostat 10-\u00b5m-thick sections from 4- and 6-day frozen nodules. Nodules were previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA), dried for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic, Rome, Italy) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer of pH 6.0 for 5 min. The sections were incubated with anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin, KL1 clone; UCS Diagnostic; 1\u2236100 dilution), anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4 clone, Dako; 1\u223660 dilution), anti-Ki67 (MIB-1 clone, Dako; 1\u2236100 dilution) and anti-PCNA (PC10 clone, Dako; 1\u2236150 dilution) 1 h at RT in PBS. Then, a secondary antibody conjugate (HRP polymer conjugate, broad spectrum, Invitrogen) was applied for 30 min at RT. The chromogenic reaction was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Zymed Labs., South S. Francisco, CA, USA). The nuclei were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed. For proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA), three sections from three different nodules for each culture condition were examined by two independent observers. The number of positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. All the labelled tumor nuclei, regardless of the staining intensity, were considered positive. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy AnalysisTo assess the effect of tumor cell/fibroblast interaction on cell adhesion, immunofluorescence analysis of E- and N-cadherin was performed on cryostat 10 \u00b5m-thick frozen sections obtained as above described from 6-day nodule homotypic and heterotypic cultures. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific), dried for 15 min at RT and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Mouse monoclonal primary antibodies anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7 clone, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 1\u2236200 dilution) and anti-N-cadherin (GC-4 clone, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1\u22361000 dilution) were applied for 1 h at RT in PBS. Sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG, 1\u2236200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at RT in PBS. Slides were mounted using 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) containing mounting medium (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA, USA). Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed for all reactions. Images were collected by using an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). They were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) equipped with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) for DAPI excitation at 750 nm and with an Ar/ArKr laser for Cy3 excitation at 543 nm. Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Image background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and colored black. Imaging was performed at RT.Fluorescence Intensity values for each sample were quantified over multiple intensity images and ROIs and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test).Western blot analysisCells of 6-day monolayer cultures were collected to be analyzed for verify the co-culturing effect on vimentin expression. Cells in mixed cultures were separated by magnetic cell sorting, using the EasySep\u2122 Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, Voden Medical Instruments SpA, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS] freshly supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (100 \u00b5M Na3VO4, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 50 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin and 20 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin) on ice and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Samples containing 30 \u00b5g of total protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) which was incubated (1 h, at RT) with anti-vimentin antibody (clone V9, Dako, 1\u22361000 dilution) in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk (blocking buffer). The blot was then overlaid with a HRP-labelled secondary antibody (Vector Labs.; 1\u22362000 dilution) for 40 min in blocking buffer at RT. The protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualised on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Membranes were reprobed with an anti \u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC15, Sigma-Aldrich; 1\u223610,000 dilution) as an internal control for protein loading. The signals were quantified by densitometry (Chemi Doc Documentation System/Quantity One quantitation software, Bio-Rad).Laurdan two photon microscopyTo investigate the impact of tumour cell/fibroblast interactions on the respective membrane lipid packing density, homotypic or heterotypic cultures, maintained for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes, were labelled with 2-dimethylamino(6-lauroyl)naphthalene (Laurdan, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA), a ratiometric fluorescent dye highly sensitive to the presence and mobility of water molecules within the membrane bilayer, yielding information on membrane order and fluidity by a shift in its emission spectrum. The probe was successfully applied to study membrane fluidity changes in living cells. Ratiometric probes allow the use of a ratio between two fluorescence intensities. This makes possible the correction of artifacts due to bleaching, changes in focus and variations in laser intensity. The Laurdan stock solution concentration was 2 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and it was renewed every three weeks. Laurdan labelling was performed directly in the culture media by adding the probe to the cells in culture at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M. After 30\u201345 min of incubation in the dark at RT, cells were washed once with the complete culture medium and dishes mounted on an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems) slide. Laurdan intensity images were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) under excitation at 800 nm with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Laurdan intensity images were recorded simultaneously with emission in the range of 400\u2013460 nm and 470\u2013530 nm and imaging was performed at RT.Image analysisMembrane fluidity can be measured in terms of ratio of emission intensities by using Generalized Polarization (GP) value, defined asGP value was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images (I(400\u2013460) and I(470\u2013530)) using the software Ratiometric image processor 2.0. The calibration factor G was obtained from the GP values of solutions of Laurdan in DMSO. G factor had \u223c2% variation across the imaging area. GP images (as eight-bit unsigned images) were pseudocoloured in Image-J. Background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and coloured black. GP histograms values were determined within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample, and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test). Line profiles and analysis of acquired images were performed with image J.Migration assayTo evaluate the reciprocal influences of tumour cells and fibroblasts on the respective migratory ability, confocal microscopy was performed in a temperature controlled room (T\u200a=\u200a30\u00b0C) on cells (homotypic and heterotypic cultures) cultured for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes. In each experiment, the single cell type of interest (tumor cells or fibroblasts) has been labelled with the fluorescent probe CellTracker Green CMFDA (Invitrogen) that is retained in living cells through several generations and is not transferred to adjacent cells. Thus, the single cell movement was analyzed over a time period of 45 min. The time interval between consecutive frames was one min. Background noise was subtracted from each image. Cell tracking was performed by using the ImageJ software plugin \u201cParticleTracker\u201d. On average 40 cells per experiment were tracked. Once the analysis region was defined by means of the feature point detection and tracking algorithm, each cell was numbered and its (x(ti), y(ti)) position coordinates measured for each time point ti (i\u200a=\u200a1,\u2026.,N\u200a=\u200a45). We used the ImageJ-plugin \u201cChemotaxis and migration tool\u201d to analyze kinematic quantities of migration processes: the migration velocity, the Euclidean and accumulated distances and the directness. The instantaneous migration velocity for each cell was calculated as  where vix and viy were calculated according to the expression:Where (x(ti+1), y(ti+1), (x(ti), y(ti))) are the positions of each cell at the time ti+1 and ti. The mean migration velocity  was calculated according to the expression:The Euclidian distance dE for each cell was calculated as the length of the straight line between the cell start point (x(t1), y(t1)) and the end point(x(tN), y(tN)):The accumulated distance dA for each cell is the result of the sum of all incremental movements measured in between consecutive images:The directness, which represents a measure of the cell's tendency to travel in a straight line, is calculated as the ratio of the Euclidian distance and the accumulated distance.A directness of D\u200a=\u200a1 indicates a straight-line migration from the start point to the end point.Statistical analysisAt least three independent experiments were performed for each protocol. The two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare means of two different groups; ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test were used to study differences of means of multiple samples. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.ResultsCharacterization of isolated fibroblastsImmunocytochemically characterized populations of the isolated mammary fibroblasts (normal dermal and cancer-associated) stained uniformly for vimentin, but resulted negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31, confirming the stromal origin of cells and the absence of contaminating epithelial or endothelial elements. As reported in literature, approximately 10\u201312% of the CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, while among the NF population only very few elements showed \u03b1-SMA immunoreactivity, probably induced by the culture condition (i.e. 2D cultures) (data not shown). Morphologically, NFs in culture showed the typical spindle-shape fibroblast-like appearance (Figure 1A), while CAFs exhibited a more irregular and flattened morphology (Figure 1B).Morphology of isolated normal and tumor-derived fibroblasts.Light microscopic view showing the different morphology of fibroblasts isolated from human healthy mammary skin (A) or human breast cancer (B) samples after 6 days of culture. Original magnification, \u00d7200.Spatial distribution of tumor/fibroblast cells in 3D co-culturesRepresentative cytokeratin-stained sections from tumor/fibroblast nodule co-cultures (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs, MDA-MB-231/NFs, MDA-MB-231/CAFs) at day 6 are shown in Figure 2, indicating the spatial distribution of tumor cells (stained with the epithelial marker cytokeratin) and fibroblasts in this culture model. As expected, in MCF-7/fibroblast cell nodules fibroblasts were concentrated in the central zone leaving a strip of almost pure cancer cells at the periphery of the nodules. In the MDA-MB-231/fibroblast cell co-cultures, a more diffuse distribution of the two cell types was observed. In contrast to the less invasive MCF-7 cells, the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells extensively infiltrated the fibroblast core, particularly in the presence of CAFs.Spatial distribution of breast tumor cells and fibroblasts in nodule co-cultures.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule co-cultures of either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin) monoclonal antibody to identify the reciprocal location of the two cell types (tumor cells and fibroblasts) in the nodule co-cultures. The more invasive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a looser association as compared to MCF-7/fibroblast co-cultures, with various cells infiltrating the fibroblast nodule core (arrows). DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification for upper panels (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs) and lower insets, \u00d7100; original magnification for lower panels (MDA-MB-231/NFs and MDA-MB-231/CAFs), \u00d7200.Similar cell distributions were observed at day 4 (data not shown).Highly invasive and metastatic breast tumor cells induced fibroblast activationThe immunocytochemical analysis for \u03b1-SMA, demonstrated that the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, when co-cultured with CAFs for 6 days, induced a sharp increase in the amount of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements, indicating the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma (Figure 3). The poorly invasive and low metastasizing MCF-7 breast cancer cells were not able to influence \u03b1-SMA expression of tumor-associated fibroblast population (Figure 3). Neither the highly nor the poorly invasive tumor cells were able to induce activation of normal fibroblasts (data not shown). The same results were obtained after 4 days of co-culturing (data not shown).Breast tumor cell induction of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in tumor stroma-derived fibroblasts.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule culture (CAFs) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-\u03b1-SMA monoclonal antibody to verify the effect of breast cancer cells on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. \u03b1-SMA expression was induced in the tumor-associated fibroblast population as a result of the interaction with the more aggressive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating the ability of these cells to promote stroma activation. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200.Cancer-associated fibroblasts exerted a mitogenic effect on breast tumor cellsTo investigate the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on their respective cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA) was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule sections. As shown in Figure 4A, Ki-67 mainly displayed a uniform nuclear staining. A weak cytoplasmic labelling was rarely observed but it did not interfere with the identification of positive nuclei. As expected, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly higher in breast tumor cells co-cultured for 6 days with CAFs compared with control MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures. In fact, the MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion (50%; p<0.001) of Ki67-positive tumor cells compared to MCF-7 cells cultured alone (34.8%) or in the presence of NFs (30.6%) (Figure 4A and 4B). The same CAF-triggered mitogenic effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells as the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells was higher (85%, p<0.001) compared to that of either MDA-MB-231 cell cultures or MDA-MB-231 cell/NF mixed nodules (61.7% and 60.3%, respectively) (Figure 4A and 4B). Mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the growth of both kinds of fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained on 4-day co-cultures and with PCNA, even though a more heterogeneous and less intense nuclear staining was observed (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts but not their normal counterpart exerted mitogenic effect on breast cancer cells.(A) Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells with NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody (MIB-1 clone) to verify the reciprocal effect of the two cell types on their respective growth rate. The MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in MCF-7 cell/NF or MCF-7 cell nodules. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells and fibroblasts showed the same behavior as observed for MCF-7 cell/fibroblast nodule co-cultures.. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200. (B) Quantitative representation of the immunohistochemical data. Three sections, obtained from 3 different nodules, were analyzed by two independent observers. The number of Ki67-positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD (error bars). Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test, *p<0.001.Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced E- and N-cadherin expression in breast tumor cellsTo test the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on the respective adhesiveness, a confocal immunofluorescence study of E- and N-cadherin expression was performed on nodule sections. The basal level of E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells is shown (Figure 5A) and quantified (Figure 5E). The analysis demonstrated the ability of NFs to induce E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells after 6 days of co-culture, when a great increase in signal intensity (\u223c2.5-fold, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures, Figure 5B, 5C and 5E) was observed. On the other hand, a CAF-triggered down-regulation of the adhesion molecule (\u223c80%, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures) was seen (Figure 5D and 5E). An increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, as the result of a 6-day long interaction with both kinds of epithelial cancer cells (up to \u223c180%, compared with CAF homotypic cultures). CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells (\u223c60%, compared with MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures). CAF-induced N-cadherin expression was found in the N-cadherin-negative MCF-7 cells. NFs were not able to influence N-cadherin expression in cancer cells, neither were they affected by tumor cells (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts and their normal counterpart affected E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells.Frozen nodule sections from MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures (A) or MCF-7 cell/fibroblast mixed cultures (B and D) were processed for E-cadherin immunostaining (Cy3: red). DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining (blue) (C). Confocal images show the up-regulation of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cell population co-cultured with NFs (B) as compared to the MCF-7 homotypic culture (A). On the contrary, interaction with CAFs promoted a strong reduction in E-cadherin expression (D). A representative experiment of three is shown. (E) F (a.u.), fluorescence intensity (in arbitrary units). Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.For all the cell types similar results were obtained with 4-day co-cultures (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts induced vimentin expression in breast tumor cellsAs shown in Figure 6, the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin was clearly induced in the relatively well-differentiated breast cancer cells (MCF-7) co-cultured with CAFs. An up-regulation of the protein was observed in the poorly differentiated, mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells. NFs did not affect the expression of the marker in cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT in breast tumor cells.Western blot analysis revealed that the vimentin protein expression was clearly induced in the low-invasive MCF7 cell line co-cultured with CAFs. Vimentin levels were increased in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs as compared with the control (MDA-MB-231 cells cultured alone). No effect on vimentin expression was found in breast tumor cells co-cultured with NFs.Breast tumor cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced cell membrane fluidityThe impact of fibroblast/tumour cell interplay on the respective plasma membrane lipid packing density was studied by means of a widely used membrane fluorescent probe (Laurdan), an amphiphilic molecule whose fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to the microenvironment polarity and viscosity. As a result of a 6-day interaction between tumor cells and fibroblasts in 2D co-cultures, a significant enhancement of both MCF-7 (Figure 7A and 7B) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 8A and 8B) cell membrane fluidity, demonstrated by reduction in GP values, was observed in the GP images and quantified within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample. On the other hand, the poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 7A and 7B). After 6 days of co-culture, the GP values of MCF-7 cells and CAFs became nearly the same (GP\u223c0.30). Interestingly, this value corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of MCF-7 cells alone (GP\u223c0.34) and CAFs alone (GP\u223c0.26). As a result of MCF-7/NF interaction, the same phenomenon occurred (Figure 7A and 7B): the GP value of MCF-7 cells and NFs is again the same (GP\u223c0.32) and corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of control MCF-7 homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.34) and control NF homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.28).Low invasive breast cancer cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced their plasma membrane fluidity.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MCF-7) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MCF-7 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.Highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells underwent a plasma membrane fluidity increase when co-cultured with normal or cancer-associated fibroblasts.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MDA-MB-231) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on plasma membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity, while MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.On the contrary, the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231cells left unchanged the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 8A and 8B).Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced migration velocity and directness of breast tumor cellsTo test whether fibroblast/cancer cell interactions could influence specific aspects of the cell migratory behaviour, such as velocity and directness, we used single cell tracking of living cells and time-lapse confocal microscopy. We obtained representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (Figure 9A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. As shown in Figure 9B, migration velocity was significantly increased in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with NFs () or CAFs (), compared with control MCF-7 homotypic cultures. CAFs seemed to be more efficacious than NFs in promoting this effect which was also associated with an increase in directness of MCF-7 cell movements (Figure 9A, 9B and 9C). The same effects were obtained when the more invasive MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with fibroblasts (Figure 9D, 9E and 9F). On the other hand, the presence of breast cancer cells did not affect the migratory ability of either NFs or CAFs (data not shown).Breast tumor cells displayed increased migration velocity and directness in vitro due to their interaction with fibroblasts.Representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. Cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with the CellTracker Green CMFDA. The starting point of each cell trajectory is plotted at the center of the graph. A significant increment of migration velocity (in \u00b5m/min) of MCF-7 (B) or MDA-MB-231 (E) cells was induced by the interaction with both CAFs and NFs. A marked enhancement of the tumor cell migration directness was promoted by CAFs in MCF-7 (A, D) or MDA-MB-231 (C, F) cells. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.DiscussionThe influence of the surrounding stromal environment on breast cancer cell behaviour has been widely recognized but the parameters involved and their relationship are still far from being fully elucidated. Defining the differences between the so called reactive stroma of breast tumors and the normal stroma in terms of their influence on tumor cell migratory/invasive properties is therefore of great interest to deepen the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible of cancer progression and metastasis. In this paper, we used conventional 2D monolayer or 3D cultures to investigate the reciprocal influence occurring between breast cancer cells with different degree of differentiation/invasiveness and fibroblasts derived from breast cancer stroma (CAFs) or their normal counterpart (NFs) on some structural and functional features strongly correlated with the invasive/metastasizing phenotype. We found an overall migration/invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both low and highly invasive mammary cancer cells, as demonstrated by their ability to increase tumor cell growth, promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reduction of cell adhesion, enhancement of membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness. These effects were not found or were less intense when cancer cells were grown with NFs under the same experimental conditions. Notably, NFs seem to favour the maintenance of the normal tissue architecture strongly promoting E-cadherin expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that in these experimental models CAFs are able to interact with cancer cells and modulate their migratory behaviour with a greater efficiency, if compared to NFs.In regard to the effect of tumor cell/stroma interaction on cell growth, cohabiting with CAFs induced a clear mitogenic response in both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells, in agreement with previous studies. The MCF-7 cell/CAF and MDA-MB-231/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion of Ki67- or PCNA-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in the homotypic cultures as well as in the mixed nodule sections of tumor cells and NFs. Even though mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the fibroblast growth, the more invasive and metastatic ones promoted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This effect was revealed by the sharp increase in the percentage of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements found in the CAF population co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells which indicates the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma activation. Consistent with data by other authors, these findings suggest that \u03b1-SMA expression in stromal fibroblast (fibroblast activation in tumor stroma) is influenced by the interacting cancer cell type.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterizes progression of many types of carcinomas. Changes in intercellular adhesions mediate this switch and dictate the cell receptivity towards signals from the extracellular milieu. In particular, down-regulation or loss of the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin represents a key step in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype for many tumors. This event is frequently associated with the up-regulation of the mesenchymal adhesion protein N-cadherin, strongly influencing cell motility. Indeed, N-cadherin was shown to be expressed in the most invasive and dedifferentiated breast cancer cell lines and its exogenous expression in malignant cells induces a motile scattered phenotype also enabling circulating tumor cells to associate with stromal and endothelial cells at distant sites. A significant result of the present study is NFs' ability to induce a strong E-cadherin enhancement in MCF-7 cells, demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on frozen nodule sections. This result disagrees with recent findings by Gao et al., who described a NF-triggered down-regulation of E-cadherin in the same tumor cells by Western blot analysis. On the other hand, consistent with data from these authors, we observed a CAF-triggered reduction of this adhesion molecule. For the first time, in our experience an increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, but not in NFs, as the result of the interaction with both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells. CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells and, as previously reported, its de novo expression in MCF-7 cells. The EMT-promoting activity of CAFs, demonstrated by their ability to trigger \u201ccadherin switching\u201d, was corroborated by the induction of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in the well differentiated MCF-7 cells and its up-regulation in the highly dedifferentiated MDA-MB-231 cells. It is conceivable that these CAF-promoted molecular changes of the tumor cell phenotype could have relevant implications in cancer progression and metastasis, not only promoting invasiveness, but also enabling interactions between tumor cells and the N-cadherin-expressing elements of the surrounding microenvironment, also in metastatic niches.Changes in the motional freedom of lipids and protein molecules in the cellular membrane represent a critical feature of pathological cells, influencing several aspects of their behaviour such as the response to chemotherapeutic agents, availability or activation of membrane receptors, migratory, invasive and/or metastatic potential. Even though no univocal trend is evident regarding the direction of alterations in tumor cell membrane fluidity, in most tumors malignant cell membranes have been found to possess higher fluidity than those of their healthy counterparts. It has also been shown that such structural change significantly correlates with an increased migratory/invasive aptitude and malignant potential of tumor cells as well as with a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the present study, two-photon microscopy imaging of cells labelled with the membrane fluorescent probe Laurdan was used to investigate whether fluidity changes in plasma membranes could occur as a result of tumor cell/fibroblast co-culturing. For the first time, we showed that such heterotypic interaction determined a significant enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, the more differentiated and poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density whose significance remains to be elucidated.Cell adhesion, changes in membrane phase properties and migration are complex and inter-dependent cellular processes, whose alterations characterize EMT and lead to the acquisition of a more motile phenotype by cancer cells, allowing for tumour invasion and dissemination.Hence, we finally studied the reciprocal influences of stromal and cancer cells on their respective migratory ability. The interaction of both poorly and highly invasive mammary cancer cells with NFs or CAFs determined a definite increment in tumor cell migration velocity. As expected, this migration-promoting activity was particularly noticeable for CAFs which were able to induce even a marked enhancement of the migration directness of breast tumor cells. On the other hand, no influence of breast cancer cells on the fibroblast migratory ability was detected. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence of the ability of fibroblasts residing in breast tumor stroma to promote both speed and directness of cancer cell migration. In addition, they support results obtained from membrane fluidity analysis.Directional persistence, indicating the existence of a preferential cell track for migration, is an important component of cell motility controlled by multiple factors which include topography of the extracellular environment as well as intrinsic cell properties. It seems conceivable that stroma-induced alterations in specific tumor cell processes, such as cytoskeletal organization, integrin-mediated cell/substratum adhesion or intracellular force creation, have a part in triggering such effect. Future efforts will need to elucidate the CAF-mediated processes that drive tumor cells to migrate on preferential tracks.In summary, our study provides a further insight into the mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression, revealing novel aspects of the reciprocal interactions occurring between malignant cells and the neighbouring fibroblast population. In particular, an overall progression- and invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both well- and poorly-differentiated mammary cancer cells was expressed as their ability in inducing structural and functional changes favouring the acquisition of a motile and invasive phenotype. Moreover, the tumor cell-triggered enhancement in N-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA levels of CAFs, together with MCF-7 cell-induced rigidification of fibroblast membrane, seems to reflect the ability of breast cancer cells to induce changes in the stromal cell microenvironment, whose significance deserves to be deepened. Defining the reciprocal influence of CAFs and mammary cancer cells on specific cell properties which promote tumor invasion and shedding light on the molecular mechanisms that subtend these effects may help in identifying new key regulators of breast tumor progression.ReferencesBreast stroma plays a dominant regulatory role in breast epithelial growth and differentiation: implications for tumor development and progressionStromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancerThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationFibroblasts promote breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9 productionMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerRegulation of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma transitionStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionTumor-associated fibroblasts (part II): Functional impact on tumor tissueInduction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in PMC42-LA human breast carcinoma cells by carcinoma-associated fibroblast secreted factorsEpithelial and stromal cathepsin K and CXCL14 expression in breast tumor progressionBreast cancer cells induce cancer-associated fibroblasts to secrete hepatocyte growth factor to enhance breast tumorigenesisCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts activate progesterone receptors and induce hormone independent mammary tumor growth: A role for the FGF-2/FGFR-2 axisGenetic events and the role of TGF\u03b2 in epithelial tumor progressionMalignant breast epithelium selects for insulin-like growth factor II expression in breast stroma: evidence for paracrine functionFibroblast-mediated acceleration of human epithelial tumor growth in vivoReconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissues in micePeripheral lymph node stromal cells can promote growth and tumorigenicity of breast carcinoma cells through the release of IGF-I and EGFTumor-stromal interactions reciprocally modulate gene expression patterns during carcinogenesis and metastasisInfluence of the interaction between nodal fibroblast and breast cancer cells on gene expressionCharacterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro to deconvolute global gene expression profiles in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of co-cultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsA method for three-dimensional coculture of cancer cells combined to any other type of cells maintained organotypicallyJanus-faced liposomes enhance antimicrobial innate immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infectionPE_PGRS30 is required for the full virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosisCalmodulin-dependent kinase IV links Toll-like receptor 4 signaling with survival pathway of activated dendritic cellsLow density lipoprotein misfolding and amyloidogenesisDynamic organization of lymphocyte plasma membrane: lessons from advanced imaging methodsVisualizing lipid structure and raft domains in living cells with two-photon microscopyHeat stress causes spatially-distinct membrane re-modelling in K562 leukemia cellsHigh-resolution imaging of redox signaling in live cells through an oxidation-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteinInvestigation of the spatial distribution of glutathione redox-balance in live cells by using Fluorescence Ratio Imaging MicroscopyCan redox-sensitive fluorescent probes measure intracellular redox potentials?Compartmentalization of the redox environment in PC-12 neuronal cellsNutrient withdrawal rescues growth factor-deprived cells from mTOR-dependent damageMammalian life-span determinant p66 shcA mediates obesity-induced insulin resistanceControlled self assembly of collagen nanoparticleRole of the life span determinant P66shcA in ethanol-induced liver damageImaging in Cell and Developmental BiologyFeature point tracking and trajectory analysis for video imaging in cell biologyMardia Kanti V, Jupp PE (1999) Directional Statistics.

Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

High expression of LRRC15 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promoted cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. In addition, TNBC cells with LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs showed an aberrant increase in \u03b2-catenin activity concomitant with nuclear localisation of \u03b2-catenin, which inhibited its degradation. These results showed that LRRC15 promoted tumour migration and invasion in TNBC cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for ~15\u201320% of all patients with breast cancer and is defined by the lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

        "content": "The treatment of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) remains clinically challenging, and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) offers down staging and improved surgical resectability. Abundant fibrous stroma is involved in malignant characteristic of PDAC. We aimed to investigate tissue remodelling, particularly the alteration of the collagen architecture of the PDAC microenvironment by NAT. We analysed the alteration of collagen and gene expression profiles in PDAC tissues after NAT. Additionally, we examined the biological role of Ephrin-A5 using primary cultured cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The expression of type I, III, IV, and V collagen was reduced in PDAC tissues after effective NAT. The bioinformatics approach provided comprehensive insights into NAT-induced matrix remodelling, which showed Ephrin-A signalling as a likely pathway and Ephrin-A5 (encoded by EFNA5) as a crucial ligand. Effective NAT reduced the number of Ephrin-A5<sup+</sup cells, which were mainly CAFs; this inversely correlated with the clinical tumour shrinkage rate. Experimental exposure to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents suppressed proliferation, EFNA5 expression, and collagen synthesis in CAFs. Forced EFNA5 expression altered CAF collagen gene profiles similar to those found in PDAC tissues after NAT. These results suggest that effective NAT changes the extracellular matrix with collagen profiles through CAFs and their Ephrin-A5 expression.",

        "content": "Integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) overexpression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression. However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

Tumor epithelial cells coexist in carcinomas with different stromal cell types that together create the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major components of tumor stroma, are active fibroblasts that, similarly to myofibroblasts, are highly heterogeneous, acquire contractile features, and express \u03b1-smooth-muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Active fibroblasts play similar roles in wound healing and in cancer, which may be considered as a wound that does not heal. CAFs represent 80% of the resident fibroblasts in breast tumors. CAFs release high levels of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases that may affect either other stroma cells or cancer cells. Accumulated evidence indicates that they play an important role in cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. Thus, CAFs represent an attractive target for cancer therapy.Exosomes are small (40\u2013100 nm) vesicles that have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication in cancer. They have been identified in most body fluids, including urine, amniotic fluid, serum, saliva, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and nasal secretions. Exosomes mediate local and systemic cell communication through the horizontal transfer of information, such as microRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins. Over the last decade, a number of studies has revealed that exosomes influence major tumor-related pathways, such as invasion, migration, epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and therapy resistance.MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of non-coding 17\u201324 nucleotide-long RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. miRs are involved in many biological activities such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, disease initiation, and progression. Their deregulation plays an essential role in the development and progression of cancer: miRs are up- or down-regulated in malignant tissues compared to the normal counterpart, and so can be either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Recently, microRNAs have been identified in exosomes, which can be taken up by neighboring or distant cells and subsequently promote oncogenic signaling in recipient cells upon delivery of the cargo.Here, we analyze whether the release of CAF exosomes and their specific miR cargo could dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that three miRs (miRs -21, -143, and -378e) are released from CAF exosomes. When loaded into breast cancer cells, they promote important tumorigenic features: stemness, EMT, and anchorage-independent cell growth. Thus, the release of CAF exosomes may be responsible for the delivery of miRs that promote oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells.RESULTSIdentification of oncogenic miRs in CAF exosomesBreast fibroblasts were isolated from human breast biopsies for primary culture. The isolated cultures were characterized by immunocytochemistry for CK22 (pan-keratin) and Western blot analysis for e-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA (Supplementary Figure 1a, b). Exosomes were isolated from breast fibroblast-conditioned media with ExoQuick-TC and characterized by Western blot analysis for the exosomal markers CD63, CD81, Hsp70, and Alix (Supplementary Figure 1c). To identify oncogenic miRs in CAF exosomes, we conducted genome-wide expression profiling of miRs (nCounter miRNA assay, nanoString Technologies, OSU), comparing exosomal miRs derived from two breast CAF cultures (patients #3 and #4) and two normal fibroblast (NF) cultures (patients #1 and #2). We found that three miRs were significantly up-regulated in CAF exosomes respect to NF exosomes: miR-21-5p, miR-378e, and miR-143-3p (Table 1). RT-PCR was conducted to confirm the array data. Interestingly, we found that miR-143-3p was up-regulated in CAF cells as compared to NFs, but we did not observe the same for miR-21-5p or miR-378e (Supplementary Figure 2a, b, c). Furthermore, we analyzed expression levels of miRs -21, -143 and -378e in CAFs from twelve different breast cancer molecular subtypes (five luminal A, six luminal B, one HER-2), but we did not observe a significant correlation between miRs\u2019 levels and molecular subtypes (Supplementary Figure 2d).miRNA expression profiles in NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes\tRatio of geom means: NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes\tUnique id\t \t1\t0,537960845\thsa-miR-21-5p\t \t2\t0,703937608\thsa-miR-378e\t \t3\t0,768350227\thsa-miR-143-3p\t \t4\t0,795360008\thsa-miR-1246\t \t5\t0,813311489\thsa-miR-1253\t \t6\t0,880781514\thsa-miR-155-5p\t \t7\t0,938786077\thsa-miR-549\t \t8\t1,032793771\thsa-miR-125b-5p\t \t9\t1,228928787\thsa-miR-1283\t \t10\t1,256584027\thsa-miR-25-3p\t \t11\t1,294286206\thsa-miR-302d-3p\t \tExosomes were isolated from four primary breast fibroblast cultures: two normal and two cancer-associated cultures. miRNA screening was performed by microarray, as described in Materials and Methods. Fold-change values were generated from the median expression of the miRNAs in the compared groups (NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes). Three miRs were found to be up-regulated in CAF exosomes as compared to NF exosomes.miRs -21, -143, and -378 expression in breast invasive carcinoma patientsWe analyzed miRNA expression in a large cohort of TCGA database breast cancer patients (744 Breast Invasive Carcinoma samples). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between miR-143 and -378 (p<0.0001) and between miR-143 and -21 (p<0.05) expression (Figure 1a). These findings suggest that the co-expression of these miRs may represent a pro-oncogenic signature of Breast Invasive Carcinoma. Furthermore, Log-Rank test analysis indicated that patients with lower levels of miR-378 had longer overall survival, suggestive of a prognostic role of miR-378 (p<0.01) (Figure 1b). In addition, miR-143 expression was significantly increased in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages (p<0.05; Figure 1c).miRs -21, -143, and -378 are co-expressed, miR-378 correlates with prognosis, and miR-143 correlates with tumor stages in breast cancermiR expression was evaluated using 744 Breast Invasive Carcinoma patients from TCGA database.

P-value calculated using Log-Rank test. P<0.05 was considered significant b. A significant increase in miR-143 expression was identified in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages.

T47D cells were treated with labeled exosomes for different times, and then were stained with DAPI and green ALEXA488-conjugated anti-tubulin antibody. Confocal microscopy confirmed the ability of T47D cells to take up NF- (patients #2 and #6) and CAF- (patient #3) derived exosomes (Supplementary Figure 3, Figure 2a). Notably, the uptake was greater after 24 hours (Figure 2a). To get further evidence of exosome uptake, we collected a z-stack of six images (Supplementary Figure 4). NF exosomes (patient #6, Supplementary Figure 4a) and CAF exosomes (patient #3, Supplementary Figure 4b) were clearly taken up by T47D cells after 24 hours, as demonstrated by co-localization of ALEXA488 and PKH26 signals. These results indicate that NF- and CAF-derived exosomes can be transferred to T47D cells, and may play a role in breast cancer biology.Breast fibroblast-derived exosomes are transferred to T47D cells and miRs -21, -143, and -378e are shuttled by CAF exosomes into breast cancer cellsT47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF- (patient #6) or CAF- (patient #3) derived PKH26-labeled exosomes for 24 hours. Exosomes were taken up by T47D cells (confocal microscopy, \u00d760 original magnification). T47D cells were stained using DAPI (nuclei) and ALEXA488-conjugated anti-tubulin antibody. Scale bar: 10\u03bcm a. T47D cells were treated 24 hours in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patient #6) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7 and #8). Real Time PCR was performed to evaluate miRs -21, -143, and -378e levels. Data obtained from three independent experiments and presented as mean value \u00b1 SD. P-value calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01 (over control). \u00a7 p<0.05; \u00a7\u00a7 p<0.01 (over NF ex) b. T47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of exosomes isolated from cy3-miR-CAF#11 (cy3-miRs -21, -143, -378e) for 24 hours. Cy3-labeled miRs were shuttled from CAF#11 exosomes into T47D cells (confocal microscopy, \u00d760 original magnification). T47D cells were stained using DAPI (nuclei) and ALEXA488-conjugated anti-CD63 antibody. Scale bar: 10\u03bcm c.miRs released by CAFs are shuttled into breast cancer cells via exosomesIn order to demonstrate that CAFs vehiculate miRs -21, -143, and -378e via exosomes to breast cancer cells, we treated T47D cells with isolated CAF- or NF-exosomes (CAF patients #3, #7 and #8, NF patient #6) for 24 hours and then assessed miR levels by RT-PCR. T47D cells treated with CAF exosomes exhibited increased levels of these miRs as compared to either non-treated T47D cells or T47D cells treated with NF exosomes (Figure 2b). In addition, to visualize the transport of extracellular miRs derived from CAFs into T47D cells, we transfected CAFs (patient #11) with cy3-labeled miRs (cy3-miRs -21-5p, -143-3p, -378e) and then collected exosomes from cell media. Then, we cultured T47D cells with these exosomes. Confocal microscopy detected the signals of cy3-miRs in the cytoplasm of T47D cells (Figure 2c). Notably, as shown in z-stack images (Supplementary Figure 5a, b, c), cy3-miRs co-localized with the signals of the exosomal marker CD63. Taken together, these results suggest that CAF-secreted exosomes mediate the shuttling of miRs -21, -143, and -378e into T47D cells.CAF exosomes promote stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent cell growthTo investigate the role of CAF exosomes on stemness, we studied suspension cultures of T47D cells. Briefly, we seeded T47D cells in stem medium in non-adherent conditions in the absence or presence of NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7 and #9). After four days, we assessed the ability of cells to form mammospheres. We observed a significant increase in the number (Figure 3a) and diameter (Figure 3b) of spheres in T47D cells treated with CAF exosomes compared with either non-treated or NF exosome-treated T47D cells, indicating that CAF exosomes increase the ability to form mammospheres. We next investigated whether CAF exosomes had an impact on anchorage-independent cell growth with a soft agar assay. We found that the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes (patients #7, and #12) increased the number of colonies as compared to the treatment of T47D cells with NF exosomes (#5, #6, and #10) (Figure 3c, 3d). Furthermore, the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7, #9, #12 and #13), but not NF exosomes (patients #5, #6 and #10), increased the expression of stemness markers (oct3/4, nanog, sox2) and EMT markers (snail and zeb) at mRNA (Figure 3e) and protein levels (Figure 3f). In addition, the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes decreased protein expression levels of the epithelial marker, e-cadherin (Figure 3f). Similar results were obtained in additional breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 3g). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that CAF exosomes foster cancer progression by promoting stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent cell growth in breast cancer cells.CAF exosomes promote stemness, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, and anchorage-independent cell growthT47D cells were cultured under non-adherent conditions in stem medium in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7, and #9).

MiR levels upon transfection were assessed with Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6a). There was a significant increase in the number (Figure 4a) and diameter (Figure 4b) of mammospheres in T47D cell cultures transfected with miRs -143, -378e, or -21/\u2212143/\u2212378e as compared to scrambled controls. On the contrary, T47D cells transfected with specific anti-miRs displayed a significant decrease in the number (Figure 4c) and diameter (Figure 4d) of mammospheres as compared to T47D cells transfected with anti-scrambled controls. The effects of anti-miR transfection on miR levels were verified by Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6b). Furthermore, we analyzed Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in T47D cells transfected with miRs -21, -143, and -378e for 48h. Interestingly, we observed an increased ALDH activity in T47D cells transfected with miRs as compared to T47D cells transfected with scrambled controls (Figure 4e). Additionally, we assessed the impact of the miRs on the expression of stem cell and EMT markers by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. T47D cells transfected with the miRs showed increased mRNA and protein levels of stemness and EMT markers, and decreased levels of e-cadherin protein, as compared to scrambled controls (Figure 4f, 4g). Similar results were obtained in additional breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 5a, 5b). MiR levels in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon transfection were assessed by Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6a). On the contrary, we found that T47D cells transfected with specific anti-miRs exhibited decreased levels of sox2 mRNA (Figure 5c) and of EMT markers (Figure 5d). We then analyzed the effect of the miRs on anchorage-independent cell growth with a soft agar assay. We observed an increased number of colonies in T47D cells transfected with miRs as compared to scrambled controls (Figure 6a, 6b). Finally, we performed invasion assay in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-21, miR-143 and miR-378e. Breast cancer cells transfected with miRs exhibited higher invasive capacity than cells transfected with scrambled controls (Figure 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f). Taken together, these results clearly support the idea that miRs -21, -143, and -378e, similarly to CAF exosomes, promote anchorage-independent cell growth, stemness, and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells.miR-21, miR-143, and miR-378e promote stemness and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionT47D cells were transfected with scrambled (scr, control) or miRs -21, -143, and -378e, alone or in combination (final concentration: 100nM).

When we performed a mammosphere formation assay, we observed a significant increase in the number (Figure 7a) and diameter (Figure 7b, c) of T47D spheres in cells treated with NF exosomes transfected with miRs compared to cells treated with NF exosomes containing scrambled controls. Furthermore, treated T47D cells had increased levels of stemness (oct3/4, nanog, and sox2) and EMT (snail and zeb) markers as compared to control cells (Figure 7d, e). These data clearly show that NF exosomes enriched in miRs -21, -143, and -378e acquire the ability to promote stemness properties and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells.NF exosomes transfected with miRs -21, -143, -378e, similarly to CAF exosomes, promote stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotypeNF (patients #5, and #6) were cultured for 48h. Then, exosomes were isolated from NF-conditioned media with ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution, and transfected using Exo-Fect\u2122 solution with scrambled miRs (scr, control), or miRs -21, -143, -378e, alone or in combination (final concentration: 130nM).

Accumulated evidence indicates that CAFs, the major components of tumor stroma, promote tumor processes such as angiogenesis, motility, metastasis, and therapy resistance in several solid tumors. Tumor stroma and tumor cells communicate not only through classical paracrine signaling mechanisms (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors), but also through exosomes. Exosomes are nano-vesicles that vehiculate lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs among cells, thereby modulating cell biology. It has been recently shown that they play an essential role in cancer development, prognosis, progression, and therapy resistance. In the context of cancer, this process entails the transfer of cancer-promoting cellular contents between cancer cells and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment or into the circulation to act at distant sites, thereby enabling cancer progression. It has been shown that melanoma-derived exosomes from the primary tumor \u201ceducated\u201d their environment to form a pro-tumorigenic niche and programmed bone marrow-derived progenitors at the pre-metastatic site to assume a proangiogenic phenotype, thereby enhancing metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, fibroblast-secreted exosomes promoted breast cancer cell migration through WNT-PCP signaling. More recently, it has been demonstrated that human CAFs secreted ADAM10-rich exosomes that promoted cell motility and activated RhoA and Notch signaling in several cancer cells.In order to develop therapeutic approaches, we analyzed the miR content of exosomes from breast CAFs. We describe here for the first time that CAFs promote breast cancer progression through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic miRs to breast cancer cells. microRNA sequencing identified increased miRs -21, -378e, and -143 levels in CAF exosomes. Immunofluorescence revealed transfer of PKH26-labeled exosomes and their miR content from fibroblasts to breast cancer cells.miR-21 is a well-characterized oncogenic miR. In particular, its presence in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis, regulates EMT phenotype, and promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Recently, exosomal miR-21 has been reported as an EMT promoter in oral carcinoma. The tumorigenic role of miR-143 depends on the cancer type, and recent findings suggest that it has a critical role in the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer, promoting tumor growth and neoangiogenesis. MiR-378e has not been studied for an oncogenic/oncosuppressive role.We analyzed miRNA expression in a large cohort of breast cancer patients present in the TCGA database. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between miRs-143 and -378 and between miRs-143 and -21 (p<0.05), strongly suggesting that co-expression of these miRs may represent a pro-oncogenic signature. Furthermore, Log-Rank test analysis indicated that patients with lower levels of miR-378 had longer overall survival, suggestive of a prognostic role of miR-378 (p<0.01). Finally, we found that miR-143 expression was significantly increased in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages (p<0.05).Many tumors, including breast cancer, are maintained by a subpopulation of cells that display stem cell properties, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Analogous to the regulation of normal stem cells by their \u201cniche\u201d, CSCs are regulated by, and in turn regulate, cells within the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have provided evidence that these CSCs mediate tumor metastasis and contribute to treatment resistance and relapse. Recent findings have shown that the hierarchically organized cell populations are more plastic than previously imagined. Thus, epithelial cells may dedifferentiate and thereby enter back into the stem cell pool. Thus, therapies aimed at targeting the CSCs within a tumor will not be curative if the pool of CSCs can be continuously regenerated from plastic, non-cancer stem cells capable of dedifferentiating and reentering the CSC state. Notably, accumulating evidence indicates that the expression of oct3/4, nanog, and sox2 transcription factors is strongly correlated with CSCs: knockdown of these genes decreased sphere formation and inhibited tumor development in xenograft tumor models. The transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is integral in development, wound healing, and stem cell behavior, and contributes pathologically to fibrosis and cancer progression. This switch is mediated by key transcription factors, including snail and zeb, and is characterized by the loss of epithelial marker expressions, such as e-cadherin. In breast carcinomas, induction of EMT promotes the generation of CSCs that are able to form mammospheres, and, similarly, CSCs isolated from tumors express EMT markers. In this scenario, discovering the underlying mechanisms that promote dedifferentiation processes could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies.In the present study, we demonstrate that CAF exosomes and their miRs promote dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells. For the first time, we provide evidence that CAF exosomal miRs induce stemness and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells. Moreover, normal fibroblast exosomes transfected with these miRs promoted stemness and EMT, similarly to CAF exosomes. Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells treated with CAF exosomes or transfected with miR-143 and miR-378e showed increased capacity to form mammospheres. Importantly, normal fibroblast exosomes, once transfected with miRs -378e, and -143, similarly to CAF exosomes, promoted the mammosphere formation. On the contrary, breast cancer cells co-transfected with combinations of specific anti-miRs displayed a strong reduction of these effects, thereby underlying a good strategy to prevent dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells. Finally, we found that CAF exosomes and their miRs increased anchorage-independent cell growth in breast cancer cells. Our data show that the identified miRs does not act in a synergic way, but together they may favor an aggressive phenotype: miR-21 seems to be the best inducer of anchorage-independent cell growth and increases stemness and EMT markers, while miR-143 and miR-378e are the strongest promoters of stemness. In summary, we conclude that CAFs regulate the development of an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer cells through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic miRs.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrimary and continuous cells and mammosphere culturesBreast cancer cell lines, T47D, BT549, MDA-MB-231 from ATCC, were grown in RPMI-1640 medium. Primary cultures of fibroblasts, deriving from patients treated at the Clinica Mediterranea (Naples, Italy), were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).For mammosphere cultures, single-cell suspensions were plated at a density of 1,000 cells/ml in Corning ultra-low attachment multi-well plates. Cells were grown in stem medium: serum-free DMEM-F12 (Sigma, Milan, Italy) supplemented with B27 (Life technologies, Milan, Italy), 20ng/ml EGF (Sigma, Milan, Italy), 10ng/ml bFGF (BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy), and 1X antibiotic-antimycotics (Life technologies, Milan, Italy). After 4-7 days, mammospheres appeared as spheres of floating viable cells.Isolation of primary cell cultures from human breast biopsiesHuman breast biopsies (samples from the Clinica Mediterranea) were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile scissors and tongs. Extracellular matrix was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight under continuous agitation at 37\u00b0C. The drawn cellular suspensions were separated on the basis of their weights by two different centrifugations: the first one at 500 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain epithelial cell pellets, the second one at 1200 rpm 5 minutes to obtain fibroblast pellets.ImmunocytochemistryThe separation between epithelial cells and fibroblasts from human breast biopsies was confirmed by the cell block technique (Shandon cytoblock kit) followed by immunocytochemistry. A primary antibody was used for CK22 (pan-keratin), a known epithelial marker, in order to discriminate epithelial cells from fibroblasts.Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of primary fibroblasts that were grown in DMEM-F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (FBS depleted of exosomes, SBI, System Biosciences) and 1X antibiotic-antimycotics (Life technologies, Milan, Italy). Culture media were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C or room temperature to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred to sterile tubes in an appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC\u2122 Exosome Isolation Reagent (SBI, System Biosciences), considering 2 ml of ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution for every 10 ml of cell culture medium. Then, the tubes were subjected to mild agitation until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. Finally, the tubes were kept at 4\u00b0C O/N (12 hours at least were necessary). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged firstly at 1500 g for 30 minutes, and then at 1500 g for 5 minutes (at 4\u00b0C or RT). At the end of the steps, white/beige exosomal pellets appeared.RNA extraction and real time PCRTotal RNA (microRNAs and mRNAs) was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed starting from equal amounts of total RNA/sample (150/500ng) using miScript reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) for miR analysis, and using SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) for mRNA analysis.

All reactions were run in triplicate. The threshold cycle (CT) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. For relative quantization, the 2(\u2212\u0394\u0394CT) method was used. Experiments were carried out in triplicate for each data point, and data analysis was performed by using Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR Systems.NCounter miRNA assayExosomes were isolated from four different samples of primary fibroblasts: two normal and two cancer-associated fibroblasts. Then, exosomal RNA was extracted in order to perform an \u201cnCounter miRNA assay\u201d (nanoString Technologies, OSU, Columbus, OHIO). Eight-hundred human miRs were digitally detected and counted in a single reaction without amplification. System performance consisted of 6 positive miRNA assay controls, 6 negative miRNA assay controls, and 5 mRNA housekeeping controls. 100ng of purified total RNA was used as starting material. miR expression levels were measured calculating the ratio of geom. means (NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes).TCGA data analysisThe collection of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform was compliant with laws and regulations for the protection of human subjects, and necessary ethical approvals were obtained. Analysis of all data was done using GraphPad Prism 6 (San Diego, CA, USA). For our analysis, we downloaded BCGSC IlluminaHiSeq_miRNASeq (level 3) along with clinical information from the TCGA database in July 2015.Cell and exosome transfectionFor transient over-expression/downregulation of miRs, cells at 50% confluence were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and 100nM of pre-miR-21, pre-miR-143-3p, pre-miR-378e, or scrambled pre-miR; or 200nM of anti-miR-21, anti-miR-143-3p, anti-miR-378e, or scrambled anti-miR (Ambion\u00ae, Life Technologies). For miR over-expression, exosomes isolated with ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution were transfected using Exo-Fect\u2122 Exosome Transfection Reagent (SBI, System Biosciences) and 130nM of pre-miR-21, pre-miR-143-3p, pre-miR-378e, or scrambled pre-miR.Transfection of CAFs with Cy3-labeled-miRsCAFs were transfected with 10nM of Cy3-labeled miRs (miR-21-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-378e, Tebu-bio, San Diego, CA, USA) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Six hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the culture media switched to fresh DMEM-F12 1% A/A, 10% exo-FBS. After incubation for a day, the culture media were collected and used for exosome preparation.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in JS buffer (50mM HEPES ph 7.5 containing 150mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 1.5mM MgCl2, 5mM EGTA, 1mM Na3VO4, and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail). Exosomes were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%, 12% or 15% acrylamide). Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). For immunoblot experiments, membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) containing 0,1% Tween-20, and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies. Detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). Primary antibodies used were: anti-\u03b2-actin and anti-\u03b1-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), anti-vinculin, anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-e-cadherin, anti-zeb, anti-oct3/4, anti-nanog, anti-sox2, anti-slug, anti-snail, anti-CD63, anti-hsp70, anti-alix, anti-CD81 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA).

Once isolated, exosomes were labeled with PKH26, a red fluorescent cell membrane linker (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, exosomes were stained 5 minutes at RT with PKH26 (diluted 1:1000 in PBS), then 1ml of BSA 1% was added to the tubes and mixed. Finally, the tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes and pellets were put in 500\u03bcl of PBS. For immunofluorescence, cells grown on glass coverslips were treated at different incubation times with PKH26-exosomes, washed six times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS. Then, cells were permeabilized with PBS 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes at room temperature, and blocked in PBS 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 minutes. Cells were incubated with anti-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz), diluted in PBS 1% BSA, for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed 3 times with PBS and treated with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed and mounted with Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. 2) Shuttling assays for fluorescently-labeled miRNAs. After a day from the transfection of CAFs with Cy3-labeled-miRs, exosomes were isolated from cell media, and T47D cells grown on glass coverslips were treated for 24 hours with the isolated exosomes. For immunofluorescence, it was used the same protocol as above, but cells were incubated with anti-CD63 primary antibody (Santa Cruz), then with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen).Mammosphere formation assayT47D cells were suspended 1000 cells/well in 1 ml of stem medium and plated into ultra-low attachment 48-well plates in presence of normal fibroblast or CAF exosomes. Alternatively, T47D cells were transfected with miRs or anti-miRs for 48 hours or 24 hours, respectively. Then, 1000 cells/well were suspended in 1 ml of stem medium and plated into ultra-low attachment 48-well plates. After 4-7 days, the formed mammospheres were counted, and the diameters were measured.ALDEFLUOR assayThe ALDEFLUOR assay was carried out according to manufacturer's (Stemcell Technologies) guidelines. Briefly, dissociated single cells were suspended in Aldefluor assay buffer containing an ALDH substrate, bodipy-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) (5\u03bcl per milliliter of sample), and incubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. A fraction of cells was incubated under identical conditions in the presence of ALDH inhibitor (10\u03bcl per milliliter of sample), diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). Cells were analyzed using a BD Accuri\u2122 C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed using the BD Accuri\u2122 C6 software.Soft-agar assay104 cells were plated in 60mm dishes in a solution containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 2\u00d7 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), TPB Buffer (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 1.25% of Noble Agar (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly, cells were harvested and counted, then a layer of 7ml with the solution containing Noble Agar were left to polymerize on the bottom of the dishes. Finally, cells were resuspended in 2ml of same solution and plated. Cells were left grown for 3 weeks in the incubator.Invasion assayIn vitro invasion assay was performed in 24-well Corning Multiwells 6.5mm Transwell\u00ae with 8.0\u03bcm Pore Polycarbonate Membrane Inserts. The lower chamber was filled with 600\u03bcl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotics. The top of the upper wells was coated with 25\u03bcl of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD) diluted 1:6 in RPMI free medium and allowed to dry out at 37\u00b0C at least 4h. Then, 50.000 cells, previously transfected with miRs for 48h, were plated in RPMI free medium in the upper chamber. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20h. Then, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed mechanically by wiping with a cotton swab, and the cells remaining on the lower side of the membrane were fixed and stained with Crystal Violet solution. Percentage of invasive cells was evaluated by eluting Crystal Violet solution with 1% SDS and reading the absorbance at \u03bb570nm.Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated at least three times. Continuous variables are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. For comparisons between two groups, the Student's t test was used to determine differences between mean values for normally distributed. Comparisons among more than three groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing. All data were analyzed for significance using GraphPad Prism 6 software (San Diego, CA, USA). P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.FUNDINGThis work was partially supported by funds from Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC grant number 18473) to G.C.; Fondazione Berlucchi to G.C.REFERENCESBasal-like breast cancer: update on clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular featuresThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerTumors: wounds that do not heal.

Breast carcinomas are composed of tumor cells and different types of non-carcinogenic cells that constitute tumor stroma. It became clear that the carcinoma-stroma interplay is critical for carcinogenesis through intercellular cross-talk. Fibroblasts, the most common and the most active type of stromal cells, are known as reactive fibroblasts, myofibroblasts or cancer-associated fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts have a prominent role in the growth, progression and spread of tumor cells through active release of various growth factors, cytokines and chemokines such as TGF-\u03b21, SDF-1 and IL-6. The active status of myofibroblasts is sustained even in absence of the activating signal, due mainly to the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop that links inflammation to cancer. One of the important members of this loop is the Let-7b, which belongs to the let-7 family of microRNAs. Members of this family are highly conserved in sequence and function from C. elegans to humans, and play important roles in several physiological and pathological processes such as development, differentiation as well as carcinogenesis. Functionally, let-7 family members act as tumor suppressor in several types of malignant human tumors by inhibiting the expression of oncogenes and key regulators of mitogenic pathways. Indeed, the expression of let-7 family members has been found reduced in many types of cancers. Furthermore, it has been shown that the restoration of let-7b expression effectively inhibited the growth of lung and breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as in mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, it has been recently reported that let-7b expression was reduced in breast cancer tissues and was inversely associated with tumor lymph node metastasis, patient overall survival and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, breast cancer patients with low let-7b expression had poor prognoses, indicating that let-7b could act as tumor suppressor miRNA in breast cancer onset and spread.In the present report, we have shown that let-7b suppresses the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts through negative regulation of IL-8.RESULTSBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts express low level of let-7b, and specific inhibition of let-7b activates breast stromal fibroblastsTo investigate the importance of let-7b in breast stromal fibroblasts (BSF) activation and the carcinoma-stroma functional interplay, we first assessed the level of this microRNA in 13 CAFs and their corresponding tumor counterpart fibroblasts (TCFs) derived from the same patients and cultured simultaneously. Total RNA was purified from these cells and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to amplify/quantify the let-7b microRNA. Figure 1A shows let-7b down-regulation in all CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, with great difference between the different pairs. This prompted us to test the possible implication of let-7b down-regulation in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, normal breast stromal fibroblasts (TCF-346) were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control sequence (TCF-346c) for 24 h, and then the levels of let-7b and its downstream targets were assessed by qRT-PCR. Figure 1B shows that let-7b level was significantly reduced, with concomitant strong up-regulation of IL-6 (12 fold) in TCF-346i as compared to control cells. Similarly, let-7b inhibition increased the levels of miR-21 and RELA that codes for NF-\u03baB (p65), while it reduced the level of PTEN as compared to the control cells (Figure 1B). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activated the IL-6-related positive feedback loop. To confirm this observation, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the expression of Lin28B and the activation of STAT3 and AKT, three major components of the loop. To this end, cell lysates were prepared from TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, and proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis. We first confirmed that let-7b inhibition increased the expression of IL-6 at the protein level as well (Figure 1C). Subsequently, we have shown that let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT), and up-regulated Lin28B, an inhibitor of let-7b (Figure 1C). This indicates that the inhibition of let-7b function activated the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop in BSFs. Thereby, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the activation of BSFs by assessing the levels of the three major markers of active fibroblasts (ACTA2 (\u03b1-SMA), SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21). Interestingly, let-7b inhibitor increased the mRNA levels of these three genes as compared to the negative control (Figure 1D). On the other hand, the level of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A was decreased in TCF-346i as compared to controls (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained when TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells were passaged once and were reincubated in let-7b inhibitor-free medium (Supplementary Figure 1). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts.Let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts through the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated 13 CAF/TCF pairs (T64 to T900), and the level of let-7b was assessed by qRT-PCR. The values obtained in CAFs were divided by the values of their corresponding TCFs, and then were plotted. (B and D) TCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then medium was replaced with inhibitor-free medium for 24 h. Total RNA was purified and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells, and were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms.Let-7b inhibition stably activates breast stromal fibroblastsWe then asked whether let-7b inhibition-dependent activation of the loop and BSFs is permanent or transient. Therefore, the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 48 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibition-free medium (IFM) 4 times. Figure 2A shows that let-7b remained down-regulated while the levels of miR-21, IL-6, RELA and Lin28B remained up-regulated in TCF-346i relative to controls, despite the removal of the let-7b inhibitor and cells were passaged several times. These findings were confirmed in other cells (TCF-64) (Supplementary Figure 2A), and at the protein level for IL-6 and Lin28B (Figure 2B). Furthermore, let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the transient let-7b inhibition activates the positive feedback loop in a persistent manner. Therefore, we also confirmed the persistent activation of BSFs upon let-7b inhibition by showing sustained up-regulation of the \u03b1-SMA protein (Figure 2B) and mRNA (Figure 2C) in TCF-346i relative to TCF-346c. Likewise, the levels of the SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2 -1 mRNAs also remained higher in TCF-346i and TCF-64i relative to their respective controls (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2B, respectively). On the other hand, the CDKN2A gene remained repressed (Figure 2C). This suggests that let-7b inhibition persistently transformed breast stromal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts likely through the activation of the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. To confirm this, we decided to investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition on the invasion/migration abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, in IFM and after many passaging, were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with serum-free medium (SFM), while lower chamber wells contained complete medium (CpM). The invasion and migration of cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 2E shows increase in the invasion/migration abilities of TCF-346i cells as compared to TCF-346c cells. Using the same system, we have also shown that the proliferation rate of TCF-346i cells was higher than control cells (Figure 2E). This indicates that let-7b inhibition persistently increased the invasion/migration and proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts, which confirms their sustained activation. This was confirmed at the molecular level by showing the persistent activation of ERK1/2 and the up-regulation of MMP9 in TCF-346i cells as compared to controls (Figure 2F).Let-7b inhibition persistently activates STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and enhances the invasion/migration/proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblastsTCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 24 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibitor-free medium 4 times. (A and C) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (B and F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms. (D and E) Exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells (104) in let-7b inhibitor-free medium were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates (invasion/migration), while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium. Cell invasion, migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Let-7b inhibition in breast fibroblasts triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in an IL-8-dependent paracrine fashionTo further show the permanent active status of TCF-346i cells, we sought to test their paracrine effects. To perform this, serum-free medium (SFM) was conditioned with TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells for 24 h, and then the resulting serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) (TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM, respectively) were first used to assess the effect of let-7b knock-down on the secretion of various cytokines using the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody arrays. Great differential levels of various cytokines were observed between TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, including, GRO, IL-6, IL-8 and IGFBP2 (Figure 3A, 3B). These results were confirmed by ELISA for the most prominent protein IL-8. Indeed, the secreted level of this pro-carcinogenic cytokine was significantly increased in TCF-346i cells compared to controls (Figure 3B).Let-7b inhibition triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in a paracrine manner(A) TCF-346i and TCF-346c cells were incubated for 24 h in SFM and the resulting SFCM (TCF-346i-SFCM and TCF-346c-SFCM, respectively) were applied to cytokine array membranes.

(D and E) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of the indicated SFCM. The migration/invasion and proliferation abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. (F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (G) MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM media containing either IgG (TCF-346i-SFCM + IgG) or neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) (TCF-346i-SFCM + \u03b1IL-8), and then whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (H) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM, and migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.To test the paracrine effects of TCF-346i cells on breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with SFM, while the lower chamber wells contained TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM. The migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 3C shows increase in the migration and invasion capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM as compared to those treated with TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, TCF-346i-SFCM enhanced the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to controls (Figure 3D).In addition, we tested the effect of TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunoblotting. Figure 3E shows that TCF-346i-SFCM down-regulated both epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam, while it increased the level of the mesenchymal markers ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail relative to cells exposed to TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, the stemness marker ALDH was also up-regulated (Figure 3E). This shows that TCF-346i cells enhanced the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 cells in a paracrine manner, which further confirms the active status of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts.Since let-7b inhibition strongly increased the expression/secretion of IL-8, we hypothesized the possible implication of this cytokine in the paracrine pro-EMT effects of TCF-346i cells. To verify this, we neutralized IL-8 in TCF-346i-SFCM using specific antibody, while IgG was utilized as control, and then MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as described above. Figure 3F shows that neutralizing IL-8 inhibited the pro-EMT process of TCF-346i-SFCM relative to cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG. Similarly, adding the neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody to TCF-346i-SFCM inhibited its pro-migratory and -invasive effects as compared to cells exposed to TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG, reaching a level similar to that obtained with TCF-346c-SFCM (Figure 3G). This indicates that the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of let-7b-deficient BSF are IL-8-related.Let-7b deficient fibroblasts stimulate breast cancer orthotopic tumor growth in miceTo investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition in human breast fibroblasts on tumor growth in vivo, orthotopic breast tumor xenografts were created under the nipples the 4th left fat pad of nude mice by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2x106) with either TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2x106), which were passaged 4 times post-transfection. Tumors bearing TCF-346i fibroblasts (T-TCF346i) appeared earlier and grew much faster relative to those having control cells (T-TCF346c) (Figure 4A). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs can enhance orthotopic tumor growth in mice. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed more necrosis in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4B). This shows that let-7b-deficient BSFs enhance tumor aggressiveness.Let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhance orthotopic tumor growthOrthotopic breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with TCF-346c or TCF-346i cells under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of nude mice. (A) The histogram shows the volumes of xenograft tumors that were measured at the indicated time points. (B) Tissues were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining (Envision 40x). (C) Orthotopic tumors bearing TCF-346c cells (T-TCF-346c) or TCF-346i cells (T-TCF-346i) were excised and whole cell lysates were prepared and protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (D) Excised tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry against the indicated proteins.Additionally, whole cell extracts were prepared from T-TCF346i and T-TCF346i tissues, and the levels of various cancer- and metastasis-promoting genes were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure 4C shows that T-TCF346i tumors express higher level of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twsit1 and vimentin, while E-cadherin and EpCAM levels were lower as compared to T-TCF346c tumors. This confirms the in vitro results showing the enhancement of the EMT process by let-7b-deficient fibroblasts. In addition, TCF346i cells increased the level of the stemness markers CD44 and ALDH and the pluripotency markers KLF4 and SOX-2 relative to TCF346c cells (Figure 4C). Figure 4C also shows strong increase in the expression levels of the downstream proliferation effectors cyclin D1 and C-Myc in T-TCF346i tumors relative to controls. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing higher Ki-67 staining in T-TCF346i tissue relative to controls (Figure 4D). This shows that the presence of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhanced the growth as well as the EMT/stemness processes in breast cancer cells in orthotopic xenografts. In addition, let-7b-deficient BSFs enhanced the formation of new blood vessels in orthotopic tumors as shown by the strong increase in the staining of the endothelial cells marker CD34 in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4D). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs promote angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. This could result from increase in the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. Indeed, the levels of IL-8, HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream target VEGF-A were higher in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c, which explains the strong increase in the neo-vascularization shown in the tumors bearing TCF346i fibroblasts (Figure 4C, 4D).Let-7b mimic stably inhibits the STAT3/NF- \u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop and represses active breast fibroblastsTo further confirm the role of let-7b in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of increased level of let-7b on active BSFs. Therefore, CAF-346 and CAF-64 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m and CAF-64m, respectively) or a control sequence (CAF-346c and CAF-64c, respectively) for 24 h, and then total RNA was purified and the level of the let-7b microRNA was assessed. Figures 5A and Supplementary Figure 3A show highly significant increase in the level of let-7b in CAF-346m and CAF-64m as compared to their respective controls. Expectedly, the mRNA level of the let-7b downstream target IL-6 was significantly decreased in CAF-346m relative to controls (Figure 5A). Similar effect was observed for miR-21, RELA and lin28B, whilst PTEN was up-regulated in CAF-346m as compared to the control cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore, let-7b mimic reduced the protein levels of IL-6, Lin28B, active STAT3 (p-STAT3) as well as active AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 5B). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inhibited the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. Concomitantly, the increase in the level of let-7b decreased the mRNA levels of the 3 main myofibroblast markers (ACTA2, SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21), while up-regulated CDKN2A in CAF-346m as compared to control cells (Figure 5C). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inactivated myofibroblats through inhibiting the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop. Indeed, let-7b mimic transformed the shape of cells from large and flat (characteristic of myofibroblasts) to rounded spindle-shaped, which characterize normal fibroblasts (Figure 6A). To test the persistent effect of let-7b mimic, cells were passaged several times, and then the expression of different relevant genes was assessed. Importantly, let-7b level was reduced in both CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S relative to their respective control cells (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). On the other hand, IL-6, miR-21, RELA and lin28B remained down-regulated while PTEN remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). At the protein levels, the IL-6 and Lin28B levels remained reduced, while STAT3 and AKT remained inactive (Figure 6C). Moreover, the level of \u03b1-SMA remained reduced at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower levels of SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2-1 were also sustained, while the CDKN2A mRNA levels remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S as compared to their respective control cells (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 3C). This was confirmed by showing reduced migratory, invasive and proliferative capacities of CAF-346m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6E and 6F). These cellular results were corroborated with decrease in the levels of p-ERK1/2 and MMP-9 in CAF-346m-S as compared to CAF-346c-S cells (Figure 6G). These results indicate that ectopic increase in let-7b level stably reverted myofibroblasts to inactive fibroblasts through inactivation of the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b feedback loop.Increase in the level of let-7b inactivates the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and suppresses myofibroblastsCAF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m) or a control sequence (CAF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b mimic was removed and replaced with let-7b mimic-free medium for 24 h.

(E) Exponentially growing cells (104) were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates, while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. (F) cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium, and cell proliferation was assessed for 72 h. Cell invasion/migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Furthermore, ELISA indicates significant decrease in the secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF-A from CAF-346m-S relative to controls (Figure 7A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effect of CAF-346m-S cells and their corresponding controls on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. To perform this, SFM were conditioned with CAF-346c-S and CAF-346m-S cells for 24 h, and then the resulting SFCM were added to MDA-MB-231 cells. Figure 7B shows decrease in the invasive/migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CAF-346m-S.SFCM as compared to those treated with CAF-346c-SFCM. Furthermore, CAF-346m-S.SFCM up-regulated the epithelial makers (E-cadherin and EpCAM), whilst it reduced the levels of the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail) (Figure 7C). This suggests that CAF-346m-S.SFCM inhibits the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Likewise, CAF-346m-S.SFCM reduced the expression level of the stemness marker ALDH (Figure 7C). Together, these results indicate that let-7b mimic represses the procarcinogenic effects of active breast stromal fibroblasts.Overexpression of let-7b by mimic decreased cancer-promoting abilities of breast myofibroblasts(A) SFCM from the indicated cells were collected, and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by ELISA and were presented in the respective histograms.

(C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH.IL-8 is under the control of let-7b and is highly expressed in CAF cellsBased on the results obtained in Figure 3, we sought to investigate the possible implication of let-7b in the control of IL-8 expression. Therefore, the IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in CAF-346m, TCF-346i and their respective control cells CAF-346c and TCF-346c. Figure 8A shows that while let-7b mimic significantly reduced the level of the IL-8 mRNA, let-7b inhibition strongly up-regulated IL-8 as compared to their respective controls. This let-7b-dependent expression of the IL-8 mRNA was also observed at the protein level (Figure 8B). This indicates that let-7b negatively controls the expression of IL-8. Thereby, we assessed the IL-8 level in various CAF/TCF pairs derived from different breast cancer patients and also normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) derived from plastic surgery. Figure 8C shows that the IL-8 expression level was higher in 8 out of 9 (89%) CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, and in all TCF cells as compared to NBFs. Indeed, IL-8 was almost undetectable in NBFs, while CAFs exhibited the highest levels (Figure 8D). This mirrors let-7b down-regulation in the majority of CAF cells compared to their TCF counterparts (Figure 1A).Let-7b negatively controls IL-8, which is highly expressed in CAF cells(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells, and IL-8 level was assessed by qRT-PCR using specific primers. Experiments were performed in triplicate and several times; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 2 independent experiments (**,P < 0.001). (B and C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (D) Box plot showing IL-8 expression levels in the indicated types of breast fibroblasts as determined in Figure 8C.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs play major roles in both the onset as well as the progression of various types of cancer, including breast carcinomas. These effects are not only autocrine, but also paracrine and through secreted exosomes. Indeed, these small non-coding RNAs are both mediators and communicators between cancer cells and their microenvironment. MicroRNAs play also important roles in modulating the biology of cancer-associated fibroblasts towards a more permissive pro-tumoral phenotype. In the present report, we have shown that the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7b is down-regulated in most breast cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to their adjacent paired TCFs; and specific let-7b inhibition granted BSFs with traits of activated fibroblasts, including enhanced migration/invasion and proliferation. Like in cancer cells, this effect was persistent through the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop, which is responsible for the persistent activation of BSFs. The activation of this loop may also provide a molecular explanation for let-7b down-regulation in CAFs. Indeed, let-7b inhibitor Lin28B, is up-regulated in response to the induction of the IL-6 feedback loop in both cancer and fibroblast cells. Previously, Zhao et al have identified several dysregulated miRNAs in breast CAFs, and miR-200 family members were severely suppressed. Subsequently, they have shown that downregulation of miR200s activated breast stromal fibroblasts. Similarly, it has been shown that miR-26b is down-regulated in CAFs from ER-positive breast cancers, and when specifically down-regulated it activated normal breast fibroblasts. This indicates that several miRNAs, like the important tumor suppressor genes p16, p53 and PTEN, also suppress breast stromal fibroblasts, may be through repressing their target onco/inflammatory genes. Several publications have reported the role of microRNAs in activating stromal fibroblasts through modulating the expression of important inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and CCL5. Likewise, we have shown here that let-7b also controls the secretion of several important cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro, Gro-\u03b1 and others (Figure 3A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effects of let-7b-deficient BSFs. Importantly, let-7b inhibition enhanced the pro-carcinogenic effects of BSFs in a paracrine manner both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. These extracellular effects of let-7b-deficient cells are IL-8-dependent. Indeed, these cells secreted high levels of IL-8, and specific inhibition of this cytokine in the corresponding SFCM suppressed the paracrine induction of the EMT process in breast cancer cells (Figure 3). In fact, let-7b represses the expression of IL-8 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Since IL-8 is not a target of let-7b and its 3\u2019UTR does not contain specific let-7b seeding site, this let-7b-dependent regulation of IL-8 expression could be indirect through the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feed back loop. It is well known that IL-8 is a target of the transcription factors STAT3 and NF-\u03baB. Similarly, the expression of IL-8 was inhibited in H.pylori infected gastric epithelial cells with let-7b overexpression and the consequent NF-\u03baB down-regulation. This shows that let-7b negatively controls 2 major imflammatory/cancer-related cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. This was confirmed by showing that most CAFs express high level of IL-8 as compared to their corresponding TCFs. Additionally, we have shown that TCFs, which were generated from histologically normal breast tissues, exhibited higher levels of IL-8 relative to those observed in normal breast fibroblasts. This confirms that TCFs have some active features as previously shown, and thereby may play important roles in local recurrence.Interestingly, inhibition of let-7b in BSF promoted breast cancer tumor growth, EMT, stemness and angiogenesis in orthotopic humanized tumors, which indicates that let-7b has non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive functions. These could be mediated through several cancer-promoting factors such as IL-6 and IL-8.These results were strengthened through overexpression of let-7b by mimic in active CAF cells wherein phenotypes of normal breast fibroblasts were restored. Indeed, CAF cells became fusiform, they expressed lower levels of \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8, they were less migratory/invasive and proliferative, with strong reduction in their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects. These data further confirmed the tumor suppressive function of let-7b. Likewise, ectopic expression of miR-200s in CAFs partially restored normal features of breast fibroblasts. Similarly, re-expression of miR-31 in CAFs inhibited their capacity to promote endometrial tumor cell migration and invasion. This conversion from active CAFs to normal fibroblasts by miRNAs was also observed in ovarian CAFs. This indicates that several miRNAs are key players in suppressing the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts through post-transcriptional gene regulation.In summary, the present findings indicate that let-7b down-regulation is an important step toward the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. On the other hand, increase in the let-7b level by mimic normalizes active breast myofibroblasts, and consequently can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of the classical anti-cancer regimen.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and used as previously described.

Cell migration and invasion were assessed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, 2x104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM-plate with thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration), and a complete media was added to the lower chamber wells used as a chemo-attractant. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24 h and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as a Cell index value which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Each assay was performed in triplicate.For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2\u00d7104) were seeded in E-plate with complete medium as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell index (CI) was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by the background value to represent cell status. Each assay was performed in triplicate.Immunohistochemistry staining on FFPE tissuesImmunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was performed using anti-Ki-67 and CD34 antibodies (Abcam) at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:150, respectively, and then slides were stained using automated staining platform (Ventana). Envision + polymer (ready to use; Dako) was used as a secondary antibody. Color was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and instant hematoxylin (Shandon) was used for counterstaining.Orthotopic tumor xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH&RC institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. 10 female nude mice were randomized into 2 groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by coimplantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2 \u00d7 106) with TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper using the following formula (Length X Width X Height).Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24 h, and then media were collected and briefly centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at -80\u00b0C until needed.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test and P values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant.QuantificationsThe expression levels of the immunoblotted proteins were measured using the Image J software. Protein signal intensity of each band was determined, and then dividing the obtained value of each band by the values of the corresponding internal control allowed a correction of the loading differences.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNo competing interests are declared by any of the authors.REFERENCESGlobal cancer statistics, 2012Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblasts in cancerThe inflammatory/cancer-related IL-6/STAT3/NF-kappaB positive feedback loop includes AUF1 and maintains the active state of breast myofibroblastsAberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors and its effects on the hallmarks of cancerDisrupting the pairing between let-7 and Hmga2 enhances oncogenic transformationLet-7 and miR-200 microRNAs: guardians against pluripotency and cancer progressionThe LIN28/let-7 pathway in cancerRegression of murine lung tumors by the let-7 microRNAlet-7 regulates self renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cellsPrognostic significance of let-7b expression in breast cancer and correlation to its target gene of BSG expressionMicroRNAs in cancerBreast cancer and microRNAs: therapeutic impactMicroRNA regulation of human breast cancer stem cellsMicroRNAs as mediators and communicators between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironmentEssential role of miRNAs in orchestrating the biology of the tumor microenvironmentmicroRNA-mediated regulation of the tumor microenvironmentMicroRNA regulation in cancer-associated fibroblastsSTAT3 activation of miR-21 and miR-181b-1 via PTEN and CYLD are part of the epigenetic switch linking inflammation to cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingMiRNA expression analysis of cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts in breast cancerMiR-26b is down-regulated in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts from ER-positive breast cancers leading to enhanced cell migration and invasionRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisp16(INK4A) Represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMicroRNAs reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts in ovarian cancerEpigenetic silencing of microRNA-149 in cancer-associated fibroblasts mediates prostaglandin E2/interleukin-6 signaling in the tumor microenvironmentMechanisms underlying differential expression of interleukin-8 in breast cancer cellsLet-7b is involved in the inflammation and immune responses associated with Helicobacter pylori infection by targeting Toll-like receptor 4Breast stromal fibroblasts from histologically normal surgical margins are pro-carcinogenicThe role of miR-31 and its target gene SATB2 in cancer-associated fibroblastsBreast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their counterparts display neoplastic-specific changesThe p16INK4a tumor suppressor controls p21WAF1 induction in response to ultraviolet light"

        "title": "Effects of cytokines derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts on androgen synthetic enzymes in estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma.",
        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

        "title": "Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts-Derived Exosomes Suppress Immune Cell Function in Breast Cancer via the miR-92/PD-L1 Pathway.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an essential component in the tumor microenvironment and have been reported to contribute to tumor progression through many mechanisms; however, the detailed mechanism underlying the immune-suppression effect of CAFs is not clearly defined. In this study, human breast cancer-derived CAFs were cultured, and CAF-derived exosomes in a culture medium were isolated. Using a miRNA profiles assay, we identify a significantly higher level of microRNA-92 isolated in CAFs exosomes. After treatment by CAF-derived exosomes, breast cancer cells express higher programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1), accompanied with increased miR-92 expression. Increased PD-L1 expression, which was induced by CAF-derived exosomes, significantly promotes apoptosis and impaired proliferation of T cells. The underlying mechanism of this effect was studied, proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells were increased after the transfection of miR-92, LATS2 was recognized as a target gene of miR-92, and further confirmed by a luciferase assay. Immunoprecipitation showed that LATS2 can interact with YAP1, chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that after nuclear translocation YAP1 could bind to the enhancer region of PD-L1 to promotes transcription activity. Furthermore, the animal study confirmed that CAFs significantly promoted tumor progression and impaired the function of tumor-infiltrated immune cells <iin vivo</i.

In this study, human breast cancer-derived CAFs were cultured, and CAF-derived exosomes in a culture medium were isolated. Using a miRNA profiles assay, we identify a significantly higher level of microRNA-92 isolated in CAFs exosomes. After treatment by CAF-derived exosomes, breast cancer cells express higher programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1), accompanied with increased miR-92 expression. Increased PD-L1 expression, which was induced by CAF-derived exosomes, significantly promotes apoptosis and impaired proliferation of T cells. The underlying mechanism of this effect was studied, proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells were increased after the transfection of miR-92, LATS2 was recognized as a target gene of miR-92, and further confirmed by a luciferase assay. Immunoprecipitation showed that LATS2 can interact with YAP1, chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that after nuclear translocation YAP1 could bind to the enhancer region of PD-L1 to promotes transcription activity. Furthermore, the animal study confirmed that CAFs significantly promoted tumor progression and impaired the function of tumor-infiltrated immune cells in vivo. Our data revealed a novel mechanism that can induce immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, the fifth most common cause of cancer death, and the leading cause of cancer death in women.A high expression of the programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most important components in the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer; it was reported that CAFs can support the progression of breast cancer through many mechanisms, and promotes migration and proliferation of cancer cells. Recently, several studies have shown that CAFs also can suppress the immune response in the tumor microenvironment by recruiting M2 macrophages or directly suppressing the function of immune cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts can affect other cells within the tumor microenvironment by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and exosomes, and it is well documented that CAFs can interact with tumor cells by exosomes. Exosomes are small vesicles with a diameter ranging from 40 to 100 nm. The exosomes derived from endocytic compartments can contain RNA, protein, DNA, and microRNA.microRNAs are evolutionarily conserved class of 22-nucleotide non-coding RNAs. microRNA can negatively regulate target gene expression in a sequence-specific manner and has been reported to play an important role in metabolism, migration, and apoptosis of cancer cells.To date, the effect of breast cancer CAF-derived exosomes on immune cells has not been studied. In this study, we found that CAF-derived exosomes can significantly promote PD-L1 expression in breast cancer cells and subsequently induce the apoptosis of T cells and impair NK cells function. Mechanically, it is observed that after treatment with CAF-derived exosomes, miR-92 expression in breast cancer cells was increased significantly, as the target gene of miR-92, LATS2, was downregulated, which subsequently enhanced the nuclear translocation of YAP1. YAP1 binds to the enhancer region of PD-L1, and enhances PD-L1 transcription activity. Further, the immune suppression effect was also confirmed in vivo, which showed that CAFs can suppress immune cell function.Overall, this study revealed a novel mechanism that can induce immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.ResultsCancer Associated Fibroblast-Derived Exosomes Promote miR-92 and PD-L1 Expression in Breast CancerBreast CAFs were isolated and cultured, as shown in Figure 1A, the immunofluorescence shows that CAFs were positive for fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP) and vimentin, to further confirm the phenotype of CAFs, western blot was performed. As shown in Figure 1B, CAFs express higher FSP, vimentin, and \u03b1-SMA compared with normal fibroblasts (NFs), which were isolated from para-cancer normal tissue. These data indicated that we had isolated breast cancer-derived CAFs successfully. Then CAF-derived exosomes were isolated and, as shown in Figures 1C,D, purified. Exosomes from the condition medium of CAFs displayed typical morphology and size, and contained exosomes markers CD63, CD9, and ALIX (Figure 1E). miRNA expression profiles of CAF-derived exosomes and NF-derived exosomes were examined, as mentioned in the materials and methods, the expressions of 2026 human miRNAs were analyzed by using a SYBR Green-based real-time PCR array. We found that 16 and 45 miRNAs were significantly (P < 0.01) upregulated and downregulated in CAF-derived exosomes, respectively, compared to those of NF exosomes. As shown in Figure 1F, the top five most upregulated miRNA in CAF-derived exosomes were hsa-miR-92, hsa-miR-7854, hsa-miR-513c, hsa-miR-544b, and hsa-miR-3161.Cancer associated fibroblast-derived exosomes promote miR-92 and PD-L1 expression in breast cancer.

Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SD; ****P < 0.0001; n.s., not significant; by paired two-sided Student\u2019s t-test.To confirmed whether upregulated miRNA in exosomes subsequently influences miRNA expression in tumor cells, real-time PCR was performed, as shown in Figure 1G. After the breast cancer cell line MCF7 was cultured with CAF-derived exosomes, no significant alternation in selected miRNA expression was observed except for miR-92, which upregulated significantly after exosome treatment. Moreover, we also found PD-L1 expression in cancer cells increased after being treated with CAF-derived exosomes (Figure 1H). This was further confirmed by Western blot (Figure 1I).miR-92 Promotes Migration and Proliferation of Breast Cancer CellsBased on previous results, we were curious about the role played by miR-92 in breast cancer. As shown in Figure 2A, the clinical sample showed that breast cancer tissue expresses higher miR-92 compared with normal tissue, implying a possible tumor-promotion role played by miR-92. Breast cancer cells MCF7 were transfected with a mimic and inhibitor of miR-92, the efficiency of transfection was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure 2B). A CCK-8 and colony genesis experiment showed that after the upregulation of miR-92, MCF7 presented a higher proliferation rate compared with negative control (Figures 2C,D), and the downregulation of miR-92 inhibited MCF7 proliferation. A wound-healing assay showed that miR-92 promotes migration, and the downregulation of miR-92 inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells, this effect was further confirmed by a Transwell assay (Figure 2E,F). Taken together, our results indicated that miR-92 promotes migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells.miR-92 promotes migration and proliferation of breast cancer cells. (A) miR-92 expression was examined by qRT-PCR in human breast cancer tissue and normal tissue. In total, 32 cancer tissues and 34 normal tissues were analyzed.

Based on the database, LATS2 may serve as a target protein of miR-92. A luciferase report assay was used to confirm the direct target for miR-92, as shown in Figure 3A. Wild-type LATS2 3\u2019-UTR and mutant LATS2 3\u2019-UTR with a nucleotide substitution in the putative binding site was subcloned into a luciferase report vector, after co-transfection of the miR-92 mimic, luciferase activity was suppressed, whereas in the luciferase with mutant UTR, this effect was not observed. These data have shown that LATS2 is a direct target of miR-92 in breast cancer cells. To figure out the underlying role played by LATS2 in breast cancer, we investigated LATS2 expression in the GEO dataset, as shown in Figure 3B. LATS2 was upregulated in normal tissue compared with tumor tissue, indicated that LATS2 might be a tumor suppression gene. As shown in Figure 3C, based on gene analysis of STRING, LATS2 possibly interacts with YAP1. To test this possibility, Western blot was performed. As shown in Figure 3D, after LATS2 was downregulated by miR-92 transfection, the phosphating of YAP1 was decreased, and nuclear translocation of YAP1 was increased subsequently, moreover, after LATS2 was upregulated by the transfection of the miR-92 inhibitor, the nuclear translocation of YAP1 was decreased. To further confirm the relationship between YAP1 and LATS2, a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay was performed. As shown in Figure 3E, it is observed that YAP1 could precipitate with LATS2; these data confirmed that LATS2 could interact with YAP1 directly, LATS2 promotes the phosphating of YAP1 and reduces its nuclear translocation.miR-92 targeting LATS2 and enhance nuclear translocation of YAP1. (A) Schematic representation of the miR-92 targeting sequences within the 3\u2032UTR of LATS2. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted in MCF7 cells following transfection with the miR-92 mimic or NC, and together with WT or Mut LATS2 3\u2032UTR luciferase reporter plasmid. (B) LATS2 expression was examined in normal and breast cancer tissue from a public dataset. (C) The protein\u2013protein network view from the STRING database showing the networks of LATS2. (D) Western blot shows the YAP1, LATS2 expression in MCF7 which transfected with the miR-92 mimic or inhibitor. (E) Co-IP analysis with anti-YAP1 antibody or IgG in MCF7. (F) Western blot analysis of YAP expression after two shRNA target YAP was transfected. (G) Transwell assay for breast cancer cells which transfected with the miR-92 mimic and/or shRNA targeting YAP (magnification, \u00d7100). Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SD; ****P < 0.0001; n.s., not significant; by paired two-sided Student\u2019s t-test.To further confirm the function of YAP1 in the miR-92 induced effect, YAP1 was knocked down by shRNA transfection. The effect of the YAP1 downregulation was confirmed by Western blot (Figure 3F). After YAP1 was knocked down, increased migration capacity induced by miR-92 was partly impaired, indicated that the pro-tumor effect of miR-92 partly relies on the LATS2/YAP1 pathway (Figure 3G).Collectively, these results have shown that LATS2 is a direct target of miR-92, LATS2 can interact with YAP1 and regulate nuclear translocation of YAP1 in breast cancer cells.miR-92 Promotes PD-L1 Transcription Activity by Enhancing the Nuclear Translocation of YAP1It has been shown that CAF-derived exosome treatment enhances PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, we sought to confirm if upregulation of miR-92 can promote PD-L1 expression, as shown in Figure 4A. Western blot indicated that miR-92 overexpression results in increased YAP1 nuclear translocation, followed by the upregulation of PD-L1. After the expression of LATS2 was enhanced by the transfection of the miR-92 inhibitor, a decreased YAP1 nuclear translocation can be observed, followed by the downregulation of PD-L1. This effect was further confirmed by flow cytometry, as shown in Figure 4B.miR-92 promotes PD-L1 transcription activity by enhancing the nuclear translocation of YAP1. (A) Western blot shows the YAP1, LATS2, and PD-L1 expression in MCF7 which was transfected with the miR-92 mimic or inhibitor. (B) Flow-cytometry analysis for PD-L1 expression in MCF7 which was transfected with NC or miR-92. Blank is an unstained group indicating negative fluorescence intensity. (C) ChIP assay was performed with MCF7 which is shown by gel bands of the RT-PCR products with 30 cycle. (D) Western blot shows the YAP1 and PD-L1 expression in MCF7 which was transfected with the miR-92 mimic or inhibitor or/and shRNA targeting YAP.YAP1 is a transcription co-activator and together with the TEAD family protein regulates many genes. To explain the underlying mechanism that causes increased PD-L1 expression after nuclear translocation of YAP1, we hypothesis that YAP1 could promote PD-L1 transcription. A TEAD-binding site was observed in 7911 bps upstream of a PD-L1 transcription start site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to test this possibility. As shown in Figure 4C, the YAP1 antibody causes precipitation in PD-L1 enhancer regions encompassing the putative TEAD binding site. Although, this was not observed in the ChIP assay using Rabbit IgG; these results confirmed that YAP1 could occupy the enhancer region of PD-L1 directly.To further confirm whether the occupation of YAP1 in enhancer regions of PD-L1 can result in increased transcription activity of PD-L1, YAP1 was knocked down by the transfection of siRNA, as shown in Figure 4D. After YAP1 was knocked down, nuclear translocation of YAP1 also decreased significantly, as expected, YAP1 downregulation also diminished PD-L1 upregulation which resulted from miR-92 overexpression.Collectively, our result confirmed that miR-92 can promote PD-L1 expression by enhancing occupation between YAP1 and PD-L1 enhancer regions.Exosome-Induced PD-L1 Upregulation Suppresses Immune Cell Function in Breast CancerProgrammed cell death receptor ligand 1 is a type 1 transmembrane surface glycoprotein encoded by the CD274 gene; it promotes T cell tolerance and escapes host immunity. It can bind to its ligand programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), which is usually expressed in immune cells and suppresses the function of immune cells. The expression of PD-1 in NK cells can be induced after NK cells are co-cultured with tumor cells; we asked whether the function of NK cells which express PD-1 can be suppressed by exosomes induced PD-L1 overexpression. To answer this question, the NK cell killing assay was performed, as shown in Figure 5A. PD-1-expression NK cells can lyse cancer cells significantly, but the function of NK cells were impaired when tumor cells were pre-treated by exosomes. The function of NK cells can be partly rescued after the administration of the anti-PD-L1 antibody.Exosomes induced PD-L1 upregulation suppresses immune cell function in breast cancer. (A) An NK cell cytotoxicity assay was performed, MCF7 treated or untreated by exosomes were used as target cells. The quantification of cytotoxicity of NK cells were shown in right panel. (B) CFSE was used to evaluate the proliferation of T cells. T cells were cultured directly with MCF7 treated or untreated by exosomes for 48 h. (C) T cells were cultured directly with MCF7 treated or untreated by exosomes for 48 h, the apoptosis rate was evaluated by an Annexin V stain. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SD; ****P < 0.0001; n.s., not significant; by paired two-sided Student\u2019s t-test.PD-1 is classically expressed in T cells, as shown in Figures 5B,C. When T cells were co-cultured with cancer cells which were pre-treated by exosomes, an enhanced apoptosis rate, and impaired proliferation rate was observed. As we expected, those effects can be partly blocked by the administration of the anti-PD-L1 antibody. Importantly, the knocking down of YAP1 markedly reduced exosome-induced apoptosis of T cells indicating that the immune suppression effect of exosomes relied on the expression of YAP1 and PD-L1.Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Tumor Progression and Suppress Immune Cell Function in vivoAn animal experiment was performed to investigate the role played by CAFs in vivo. Mesenchymal stem cells, which are a precursor of CAFs, were used in this xenograft model. MA-782-mCherry alone and MA-782-mCherry mixed with MSCs were injected into the flanks of Balb/c mice. The mice were sacrificed after three weeks, as shown in Figure 6. An MA-782-mCherry mixed with MSCs generated a larger tumor volume than those produced by MA-782-mCherry alone, and a heavier tumor weight in MA-782-mCherry mixed with MSCs was observed compared with MA-782-mCherry alone. This result indicated that CAFs could promote tumor progression in vivo.Cancer associated fibroblasts promote tumor progression and suppress immune cell function in vivo. (A) The weight of tumors isolated from the mice with MA-782 cells co-injected with or without MSC (n = 8). (B) PD-L1 expression of MA-782 which gated as mCherry+. (C,D) CD107a expression of cytotoxicity T cells and NK cells. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SD; ****P < 0.0001; n.s., not significant; by paired two-sided Student\u2019s t-test.To investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for tumor volume, sigle cell suspension of the tumor was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 6B, cancer cells in the tumor which expressed mCherry were studied, PD-L1 in tumor cells, which gated as mCherry+ were examined, the result confirmed that tumor cells express higher PD-L1 in vivo after the addition of MSCs. To test the effect of PD-L1 in vivo, NK cells and cytotoxic T cells were gated as CD49b+CD335+ and CD8+CD4+, respectively. CD107a (LAMP-1) may be a marker for the degranulation of NK, we used this marker to test the function of immune cells. As shown in Figures 6C,D, the addition of MSCs significantly reduced CD107a expression in NK cells and T cells; the result indicated that CAFs could suppress the function of immune cells in vivo.Taken together, our results indicated that CAFs promote tumor progression and suppress immune cell function in vivo.DiscussionBreast cancer remains a significant threat to the health and wellness of women in the United States, accounting for 30% of all new cancer diagnoses and almost 41,000 deaths annually. Immunotherapy is an effective strategy for a variety of cancers and has been shown to promote impressive survival benefits in patients, however, most breast cancers are resistant to monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are an important component of the tumor microenvironment and have been reported to suppress immune cell function in a variety of tumors, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Exosome-based miRNA delivery is one strategy of CAFs to influence other cells present in the microenvironment. In this study, we reported a novel mechanism of immune suppression based on exosomes delivery.miR-92 has been reported to play an oncogenic role in a variety of cancers. In this study, we observed that after the treatment of CAF-derived exosomes, miR-92 expression was significantly increased, whereas other selected micro-RNA expression remained stable. We subsequently investigated the role of miR-92 in breast cancer cells. As previously reported, we found that the upregulation of miR-92 promotes migration and invasion in breast cancer cells.Programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 is a type 1 transmembrane surface glycoprotein encoded by the CD274 gene, it promotes T cell tolerance and escapes host immunity, but the regulation of PD-L1 in the tumor is still under investigation. In this study, we used a luciferase activity assay to confirm that LATS2, which is an important component of the Hippo pathway, was a direct target of miR-92. Co-IP was performed to confirm that LATS2 could directly interact with YAP1, LATS2 promotes YAP1 phosphating and subsequently prevents YAP1 nuclear translocation. It has been reported that YAP1 activity can regulate PD-L1 expression in some types of cancer. In this study, ChIP was used to confirm that YAP1 directly occupied the enhancer regions of PD-L1, and subsequently resulted in the upregulation of PD-L1.We further confirmed the immune suppression effect of CAF-derived exosomes and found that after cancer cells were treated by CAF-derived exosomes, co-culture with cancer cells resulted in an increased apoptosis rate and impaired immune cell function.We further confirmed our proposed mechanism in vivo, based on flow cytometry, we confirmed that CAFs significantly suppressed immune cell function in vivo, and promoted PD-L1 expression in breast cancer cells.Collectively, this study revealed a novel mechanism that can induce immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementBreast cancer tissues were obtained from patients who had undergone surgery at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University.

When 95% confluence was achieved, the cell monolayer was gently scratched using a 200-\u03bcm sterile plastic pipette tip. Then, the wound was photographed. After 24 h, the healing wound was photographed. For Transwell migration or invasion assays, 4 \u00d7 104 cells suspended in medium without serum were seeded in the upper chamber membranes coated without/with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Then, a 600 \u03bcL medium with 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 h, the underside of the membrane was fixed for 30 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The inner side of the membrane was wiped with a cotton swab. Then, cells were quantified under a microscope.Detection of NK Cells Killing ActivityNK-92 cells were added into 1 \u00d7 105 cancer cells, which were labeled with CFSE and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 h. After the incubation, all cells were stained with 7-AAD (BD Bioscience). Cells were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry.Transmission Electron MicroscopyFor transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 10 \u03bcL of exosome suspension was absorbed onto carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh) for 1 min. Samples were washed with double-distilled water and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate solution for 1 min. After being air dried, the samples were visualized at 87,000\u00d7 in a Phillips Tecnai transmission electron microscope at 80 kV.Exosome Size AnalysisTunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) technology was used to investigate the size and numbers of the exosomes. The TRPS apparatus is an iZon-qNano (iZon Science Europe Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom). The measuring cell used for these experiments is a NP100 membrane (iZon Science Europe Ltd.). The concentration of particles was standardized using multi-pressure calibration with 70 nm carboxylated polystyrene beads at a concentration of 1.5 \u00d7 1011 particles/mL, as previously reported.Isolation of Mesenchymal Stem CellsIn brief, bone marrow was collected from the femurs and tibias of 8\u201310 week-old C57BL/6 or Balb/c male mice. For MSC isolation, the cells were carefully suspended and passed through a 70 mm strainer, spun down, and resuspended in a minimal essential medium supplied with 10% MSC certified FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (100 units of penicillin, 100 mg of streptomycin, and 0.25 mg of amphotericin B per milliliter, HyClone; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The medium was replaced the next day to remove the unattached cells.Flow Cytometry AnalysisCells were digested with trypsin and then washed by PBS. The Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime) was applied to practice cell apoptosis in line with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The apoptotic cells were dual-stained with PI and Annexin V-FITC, using the Annexin V/FITC kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). The analysis was carried out via the BDTM LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Afterward, data were measured with the Cell Quest (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, United States) software.Isolation of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Normal FibroblastsCAFs and primary colorectal NFs were isolated from breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissue. Briefly, the specimen was cut into sections, then subjected to collagenase IV (Invitrogen, CA, United States) digestion for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. After digestion, it was passed through a 70 \u03bcm mesh (BD Falcon, CA, United States). We centrifuged the filtrate and cultivated the cells in red blood cell lysis buffer to eliminate red blood cells, washed the remaining cells with PBS. The cells for analysis were re-suspended in FACS staining buffer for flow cytometry, cells for culturing were then plated in DMEM with low glucose content containing 10% FBS (Gibco, United States) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, adherent cells were removed to other culture dishes for the cultivation of CAFs and NFs. For the collection of CM, 2 \u00d7 106 cells were seeded onto a 10-cm plate and cultured for 36 h, the medium was replaced with 5 mL fresh F12 without serum and cells were cultured for a further 24 h, the CM was collected and filtered and stored at \u221240\u00b0C.Exosome Preparation and AnalysisExosomes were collected by Iodixanol Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation according to previously published protocol. In brief, the CAFs or NFs were incubated for 48 h in complete PRMI1640 medium with 10% FBS that was previously depleted of contaminating vesicles by overnight centrifugation at 100,000 \u00d7 g using a Beckman Coulter Allegra\u00ae X-15R centrifuge. Density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed by loading the sample onto 50, 30, and 10% iodixanol layers and then centrifuged at 120,000 \u00d7 g for 24 h.Luciferase Reporter AssayA luciferase reporter assay was used to test the miR-92/LATS2 relationship. The firefly luciferase reporter gene expression vector, controlled with the SV40 enhancer, was purchased from GeneCopoeia. The wild-type or mutant LATS2 3\u2019-UTR sequence (LATS2; NM_014572; HmiT007288- MT06) was inserted downstream of the luciferase gene, whereas no oligonucleotides were inserted in the control vector. Renilla luciferase was used as a tracking indicator for transfection efficiency. The luciferase activity was measured using a LightSwitch Assay Reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (SwitchGear Genomics).ChIP AssayFragmented chromatin from cancer cells was incubated with anti-IgG (negative control) and anti-YAP. Recruited DNA was subjected to PCR using the primers for distal enhancer regions of PD-L1, and PCR products were electrophoresed in agarose gel. The ChIP assay was conducted using the ChIP Assay Kit (Millipore Corporation). Polyclonal antibodies for YAP (Cell Signaling Technology) and control rabbit antibody for IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) were used for ChIP. Primers were used for RT-PCR to amplify the PD-L1 gene.Cell Viability AssayCell viability was determined by CCK8 assays. Briefly, cancer cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 \u00d7 103 cells/well) and treated with corresponding processes. CCK8 was added into the wells for 3 h at indicated times. The absorbance in each well at a wavelength of 450 nm (A450) was measured with a Thermomax microplate reader.Western Blot Analysis and ImmunoprecipitationCancer cells were collected, washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Thermo). Protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis in an 8\u201312% premade sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide mini gel (Tris-HCL SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with indicated antibodies and detected by using a chemiluminescence method. For immunoprecipitation (IP), total cell lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies overnight and subsequently rotated with protein A/G beads for 2\u20134 h at 4\u00b0C. Beads were washed three times using NP-40 lysis buffer, mixed with 2 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5\u201310 min. The co-precipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis.Animal ExperimentAnimal assays were performed according to the Experimental Animal Care Guidelines. Approximately 6\u20137 week-old BALB/c mice were bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. The mice were divided into four randomized groups (n = 6 per group), 1 \u00d7 105 CT-26-mCherry with or without BALB/c derived BM-MSC were subcutaneously injected into the flank of each mouse. The tumor size was measured using digital Vernier calipers every 3 days, the tumor volume was calculated as the following formula: volume = 1/2 \u00d7 (width2 \u00d7 length). All mice were sacrificed after 18 days, and the tumors were collected and visually examined. Then the tumor was cut into sections and subjected to collagenase IV (Invitrogen, CA, United States) digestion for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. After digestion, it was passed through a 70 \u03bcm mesh (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) and analyzed by flow cytometry.Statistical AnalysisAll the data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adopted to analyze the differences among groups by using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States).

        "content": "It is widely recognized that stromal fibroblasts significantly influence biological properties of multiple tumors including breast cancer. However, these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions seem to be essential in tumor biology and it is not fully clear whether this interaction is tumor type-specific or has a more general non-specific character. To elucidate this question, we tested the effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from different types of tumors (breast cancer skin metastasis, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma arising from oral cavity mucous membrane) on the EM-G3 breast cancer cell line. The results were compared with control experiments using normal human dermal fibroblasts, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and 3T3 fibroblasts influenced by the fibroblasts prepared from the basal cell carcinoma. Our results demonstrated that expression of luminal marker keratin 8 was influenced only by CAFs prepared from any tested tumors. In contrast, all tested types of fibroblasts showed a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of basal/myoepithelial marker keratin 14. The CAFs also elevated the number of cells with positivity for both keratins 8 and 14 that are similar to ductal originated precursor cells. The expression of proliferation marker Ki67 was not influenced by any of the tested fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that CAFs are able to influence the phenotype of a breast cancer cell line and this effect is based on a tumor type-unspecific mechanism. Finally, a clear functional difference between normal and CAFs was demonstrated.",

Beside significant individual/intrinsic differences the sensitivity of CAFs seems to depend also on the cancer type as well as the microenvironment.BackgroundCarcinomas are complex tissues in which cancer cells interact with their surrounding stromal compartment composed of fibroblasts, infiltrating immune cells, vascular network, and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Cancer cells actively influence their adjacent stroma by producing stroma-modulating growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interleukins, and tumor growth factor beta (TGFbeta). Once activated, tumor fibroblasts (also termed \"carcinoma-associated fibroblasts\", CAFs) differ from normal fibroblasts and exhibit a distinct gene expression pattern. Various studies have shown that CAFs express a range of growth factors and extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes that modulate proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and tumor angiogenesis. In xenograft models it has been demonstrated that CAFs are much more competent in promoting tumor growth than normal fibroblasts. Importantly, these tumor promoting properties of CAFs appear to be partially independent of the presence of tumor cells and are maintained in vitro even in the absence of the epithelial cells. Both genetic and epigenetic alterations underlying this stable tumor supporting phenotype of CAFs have been suggested.The functional activity of CAFs appears to be an important determinant for the clinical behavior of tumors. Chang et al. analyzed expression profiles of serum-activated fibroblasts as models for wound healing fibroblasts and compared them with profiles obtained from different tumors. They identified gene expression patterns similar to that of activated fibroblasts within the gene expression signature of tumors. This \"wound healing signature\" was predictive for poor overall survival and increased risk of metastasis in breast, lung, and gastric cancers. The importance of the functional state of the stromal cell compartment was further supported by a recent work published by Finak et al.. They analyzed the expression profiles of microdissection-purified tumor stroma from 51 primary breast tumors and identified a stroma cell signature as an independent prognostic factor predicting clinical outcome more precisely than signatures from whole tissue.In view of these central roles of CAFs for the biology of cancer it seems likely that CAFs are also important for the survival of tumor cells following treatment with DNA damaging agents. Stromal fibroblasts can influence chemosensitivity of tumor cells indirectly by producing and activating extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. This activated ECM confers chemoresistance by integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin. Only limited data on the response of CAFs to chemotherapy and their potential impact on therapy outcome are available. Using a xenograft prostate tumor model, El Hilali et al. demonstrated a chemotherapy induced loss of overall tumor mass without reduction of the total number of tumor cells. In addition, co-culture experiments and Xenograft models demonstrated that the efficacy of chemotherapy-induced cell cycle arrest or senescence in stromal fibroblasts is critical for the sensitivity of the tumor compartment. These observations support the view that the response of stromal cells to toxic stress contributes to resistance or sensitivity of the tumor to chemotherapy and might contribute to clinical outcome. We therefore investigated short-term effects of chemotherapy on tumor stroma ex vivo in primary tissues derived from newly diagnosed breast cancer and lung cancer specimens and in isolated CAFs from breast and lung.MethodsPatientsThe database of the Robert Bosch Hospital was reviewed to select women with invasive breast carcinomas referred between 2004 and 2006. Sections for 22 patients were available both from pre-treatment biopsies and post-treatment surgery specimens. Patients' characteristics are given in additional file 1. They received neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens (as also described in additional file 1) followed by surgery. Pathologic diagnosis as well as tumor and stromal cell grading were performed on a tumor tissue sample obtained by a core needle biopsy before treatment and from the same tumor after surgery. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (3 \u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).For isolation of primary cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tissue slice preparation, fresh material from primary breast and lung tumors were obtained from patients newly diagnosed for breast cancer at the Robert Bosch Hospital (n = 17 for tissue culture and n = 9 for culture of isolated CAFs) and for lung cancer at the Klinik Schillerh\u00f6he (n = 16 for tissue culture and n = 28 for CAF culture) immediately after resection. The investigation was approved by the local ethics committee (project number 396/2005V) and informed consent was obtained from the patients.Tissue slice preparation and cultureTissue slice preparation and culture was performed as described previously. For breast cancer tissue cultivation, we used Mammary Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). Tissue slices from lung cancer were cultivated in Airway Epithelial Cell Medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). Treatment with paclitaxel started 24 hours after preparation of slices for additional 72 hours. After treatment, slices were fixed in buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for further investigation by immunohistochemistry.Isolation, cultivation, and characterization of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)Tumor tissue was enzymatically digested using a Tissue Disaggregation Buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM Glucose, 2.5 mM MgCl2 \u00d7 6H20, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) supplemented with collagenase (167 U/ml), DNase (250 U/ml) and protease (0.25 mg/ml) for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. The disaggregated tissue was filtered through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer (BD Falcon) and the flow-through was seeded in cell culture flasks. The outgrowing fibroblasts were cultivated with RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS.We analyzed CAFs isolated from 16 breast and lung cancer tissue specimens for fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and epithelial specific antigen (ESA) expression. Fibroblasts in the tumor stroma synthesize FAP, a type II transmembrane protein that functions as a serine protease. FAP is expressed in more than 90% of stromal fibroblasts associated with colon, breast, and lung carcinomas. The expression of FAP and ESA was investigated in CAFs from 16 breast and lung cancers using a FAP antibody (FAP-scFv36) or ESA antibody (biomeda, Plovdiv, Bulgaria) by FACS analysis (data not shown). We further performed karyotype analysis with the first 4 CAFs (data not shown). To evaluate 50% growth inhibition values (GI50), we examined cell viability using MTT assays. For this, 5,000 to 10,000 CAFs were treated with 100, 90, 60, 45, 30, 20, 13.3, 8.9, 5.9, 3, 1.48, 0.74, 0.15, 0.07, 0.01 \u03bcM paclitaxel or 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.57, 0.78, 0.39 \u03bcM cisplatinum for 48 hr in a 96 well plate. All studies using CAFs were performed within passages 2 to 5. As a reference, we used a tumor cell line panel consisting of 22 cell lines from lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, AML, and CML.Genotyping of TP53-Arg72Pro and ERCC1-118C/T in CAFs from lung cancer tissue specimens was performed by direct sequencing. Mutation analysis of TP53 was done by sequencing the complete TP53 cDNA. We isolated RNA from frozen cell pellets using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was reverse transcribed using the RevertAid\u2122 H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The following Primers were used for cDNA amplification (sense: cgtccagggagcaggtag; antisense: ccacaacaaaacaccagtgc) and sequencing (primer 1: cacatgacggaggttgtgag; primer 2: ccacaacaaaacaccagtgc). For genotyping of ERCC1 polymorphism, we isolated DNA from frozen pellets using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and performed a PCR with the following primer pair: sense: cctcagacctacgccgaata, antisense: gctggtttctgctcataggc.SNP analysis of Mdm2-309T/G was done with a PCR-RFLP-based technique using PCR primers: sense: cgcgggagttcagggtaaag and antisense: actacgcgcagcgttcacac. The PCR product was digested with 5 units of MspA1I (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt a.M., Germany) at 37\u00b0C for 16 h and electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (a representative example is shown in additional file 2).Pathologic examination and immunohistochemistryBoth, tumor and stromal cell response to neoadjuvant treatment was analyzed by comparing H&E stained tissue sections from corresponding samples before and after chemotherapy. We evaluated the regression grade of the tumor compartment according to Sinn et al. (grade 0: no effect, grade 1: resorption and tumor sclerosis, grade 2: minimally focally invasive residues of 5 mm or smaller, grade 3: only non-invasive tumor residues, grade 4: no viable tumor cell detectable). Tumors with regression grades 2, 3, or 4 were defined as tumors with pathological response. To estimate the response of the stromal compartment to chemotherapy, we established a grading system consisting of 4 grading types (representative examples for the grading types are shown in additional file 3). Grade 0 represents tumors with less than 10 fibrocytes per high-power field characterized by small, spindle-shaped nuclei. This grading type corresponds to complete inactive stroma with the lowest cellular density in the stromal area. Grade 1 was defined as mostly inactive stroma with more than 10 fibrocytes per high-power-field and 1\u20133 vesicular cells (fibroblasts or endothelial cells with enlarged vesicular nuclei). Grade 2 is characterized by intermediate reactive stroma with more than 10 fibrocytes and 3\u201310 vesicular cells per high-power-field. Tumors with the highest cellular density in stromal area were classified as grade 3 (more than 10 fibrocytes and more than 10 vesicular cells per high-power-field). Stromal response was defined as a change from grade 2 or 3 to grade 0 or 1.Clinical assessment of chemotherapy was done by comparing tumor size before and after therapy. This included both sonography and MRT. A clinical partial response (cPR) was defined as a >50% reduction in the product of the two longest perpendicular tumor dimensions. Patients not achieving a 50% reduction were considered to be clinical non responders (cNR). Patients without any residual tumor were defined as clinical complete responder (cCR).KI67 (anti-human KI67 Antigen, Clone MIB-1, 1:50, Dako) staining was performed using the Dako Envision Kit on a DakoCytomation Autostainer (both DakoCytomation) according to the manufacturer's manual. TUNEL staining was done in compliance to the manufacturer's manual (ApopTag\u00ae Kit S7100, Chemicon, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Immunohistochemical assessment was performed independently by two observers (MS, PF). The percentage of TUNEL and KI67 positive cells was assessed using an \u00d740 objective. 3\u20137 randomly selected fields were examined for each slice. Discrepancies were resolved by simultaneous examination using a double headed microscope.StatisticsStatistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 Software (GraphPad Prism Software Incorp., San Diego, CA, USA). Different groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Correlation between tumor cell response and stroma cell response in tissue culture was calculated using Fisher's exact test.ResultsNeoadjuvant chemotherapy effects on the stromal compartment of breast cancer in vivoWe investigated the reaction of CAFs on neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a retrospective analysis of breast cancer patients by comparing H&E sections from needle biopsy obtained before treatment with those from the corresponding surgical breast cancer specimen. In 9 of 22 needle biopsies we detected a high cell density in the stromal area before chemotherapy (stroma grade 2 or 3). These 9 cases revealed a significant decrease in stroma cell density after chemotherapy (additional file 1; representative results in Fig. 1a). Pathological tumor cell response was detected in 10 of the 22 cases (regression grade 2, 3, and 4; additional file 1). In 5 cases with stromal response, no change in the tumor cell compartment was observed indicating that stromal response is independent of tumor cell regression (Fisher's exact test: P = 0.67; additional file 1).Stromal cells are target of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in vivo. (a) Representative H&E stained sections from corresponding breast cancer samples before (left panel) and after (right panel) chemotherapy. (b) Clinical response and pathological response of stromal cells (upper panel) and tumor cells (lower panel). Before chemotherapy and before surgery, the two longest perpendicular diameters of the tumor were measured either by MRT or sonography. The product of these diameters was used as a measure of tumor size. Partial clinical response (cPR) was defined as reduction of tumor size of more than 50%; tumors with a reduction of less than 50% or induction of size were defined as non responders (cNR). Tumors with pathological stroma response (characterized by a reduction from stromal grade 2 or 3 to grade 0 or 1; upper panel) and tumors characterized by pathological tumor cell response (tumors with regression grade 2, 3, or 4; lower panel) are displayed as black columns.To determine whether the pathological response of stroma and/or tumor correlates with clinical outcome we compared clinical responders (more than 50% reduction in tumor size) and non-responders (less than 50% reduction or tumor progression). In this small patient cohort, a total of 12 patients showed clinical response including 2 patients with complete tumor regression. Of the 12 tumors with clinical response, 6 showed a significant pathological stromal cell response and 7 responded in their tumor cell compartment with an overlap of 4 cases (Fig. 1b). Three tumors with clinical response showed no pathological response in their stromal nor tumor compartment. These findings suggest that the magnitudes of the reduction for both stroma and tumor cell compartments after cessation of chemotherapy do not correlate with clinical tumor response. However, due to the limited number of patients included in this study, no final conclusion can be drawn.Cytotoxic chemotherapy effects on isolated CAFs in vitroWe analyzed the acute effects of paclitaxel and cisplatinum on isolated CAFs from primary tumors to evaluate whether CAFs are a direct target of cytotoxic chemotherapy. We isolated CAFs from 9 breast and 28 lung cancer specimens and cultivated them ex vivo for up to 10 passages. All CAFs tested were shown to be positive for FAP and negative for the epithelial specific ESA antigen (not shown) indicating that the isolated fibroblasts were highly homogenous with minimal contamination of other cell types. None of the CAFs investigated for karyotype showed any detectable loss or gain of chromosomal material (not shown).Notably, CAFs from lung cancer turned out to grow faster than CAFs isolated from breast tumors (not shown). All CAFs exhibited constant proliferation rates for at least 10 passages (not shown). CAFs were treated with increasing dosages of cisplatinum and paclitaxel for 48 hours (see materials and methods) with cell viability analyzed by means of MTT assay. We compared the 50% growth inhibition (GI50) values from these CAFs to those observed in 22 tumor cell lines. Both CAFs from breast and lung cancer specimens showed a significantly lower sensitivity to paclitaxel than the tumor cell line panel (Fig. 2, left panel). In contrast, the sensitivity to cisplatinum in CAFs was highly variable. CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas were significantly less sensitive than CAFs from lung cancer specimens (GI50 = 22.6 \u00b1 6.8 \u03bcM for breast vs. GI50 = 11.4 \u00b1 6.7 \u03bcM for lung). The variability of the response of lung CAFs to cisplatinum was comparable to that observed in the cancer cell line panel (GI50 = 13.3 \u00b1 8.7 \u03bcM; Fig. 2, right panel). Importantly, the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs did not change significantly when tested in early and late passages (not shown).Sensitivity of CAFs to cytotoxic chemotherapy in vitro is highly variable. Primary CAF cell strains from 9 breast and 28 lung tumors and a panel of 22 tumor cell lines as a reference were cultivated in the presence or absence of different doses of paclitaxel (left panel) or cisplatinum (right panel). Cell growth was measured by means of MTT. Each dot represents the drug concentration to achieve 50% inhibition of cell growth (GI50) in one CAF cell strain or cell line.TP53 somatic mutations and analysis of Mdm2, ERCC1, and TP53 polymorphismsThe p53 tumor suppressor protein is a central player in the cellular reaction to genotoxic stress. A high frequency of somatic mutations in the TP53 gene has been reported in the stromal compartment of breast cancer. As we observed a highly variable sensitivity to the DNA damaging agent cisplatinum, we investigated if this variability selectively observed in CAFs from lung cancer is due to genetic changes in genes coding for regulators of DNA damage response. We therefore performed mutation analysis in primary cultured CAFs from lung cancer tissue specimens. No somatic exon mutation was detected in any of the 28 CAFs from lung (not shown).The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) TP53-Arg72Pro, Mdm2-309T/G, and ERCC1-118C/T have been implicated in the clinical response to cisplatinum. We therefore tested whether these polymorphisms explain the variable sensitivity to cisplatinum observed in CAFs from lung cancer. As shown in figure 3 (left panel) and additional file 4, the TP53 Arg/Pro G>C showed a non-significant trend towards decreased sensitivity in the presence of the variant genotype and neither the Mdm2 nor the ERCC1 polymorphisms were associated with sensitivity to cisplatinum in these cells (Fig. 3, middle and right panel; additional file 4).Sensitivity to cisplatinum is not significantly correlated to polymorphisms in TP53, Mdm2 and ERCC1 in CAFs from lung cancer. Relationship between cisplatinum sensitivity (GI50 values) and genotype distribution of the polymorphisms TP53-Arg72Pro (left panel), Mdm2-309T/G (middle panel), and ERCC1-118C/T (right panel) in 28 CAF cell strains from lung cancer specimens (solid circles).Impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on proliferation and cell death of stromal cells within tumor tissue in vitroTo evaluate if the sensitivity of CAFs is also determined by the tumor microenvironment, we performed ex vivo experiments with tissues from 17 patients with newly diagnosed breast carcinoma and 16 lung cancer patients.Tissue slices obtained from breast cancer specimens were incubated with or without paclitaxel and analyzed for proliferation and cell death both in stromal and tumor cells using KI67 and TUNEL immunohistochemistry (representative examples are given in Fig. 4a for KI67 (left panel) and for TUNEL (right panel)). Paclitaxel-induced induction of TUNEL positive cells and reduction of KI67 positive cells was observed both in the tumor and stromal cell compartments. Most of the cases showed a reduction in their KI67 index of more than 10% both in their tumor and stromal cells following paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, an increase of TUNEL positive cells of more than 20% was observed in 7 of 14 cases both in tumor and stromal cells. Reduction of both proliferation and increase of cell death was correlated in tumor and stromal cells following paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 4b; P = 0.015 and P < 0.001, respectively).Cytotoxic chemotherapy targets stromal cells in tissues from breast cancer patients. Tissue slices from 17 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were treated with or without paclitaxel for 72 hours, then fixed in formalin and analyzed for proliferation and cell death using KI67 and TUNEL immunohistochemistry, respectively. (a) Representative examples of KI67 (left panel) and TUNEL (right panel) stained sections from tumor tissue slices from one patient incubated with or without paclitaxel. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. (b) The percentage of KI67 (left histograms) and TUNEL (right histograms) positive cells of both the tumor (upper panel) and the stromal compartment (middle panel) was assessed using an \u00d740 objective. Three to 7 randomly selected fields were examined for each section. The correlation of tumor and stromal response to paclitaxel regarding changes in proliferation and cell death is shown in the lower panels of the figure. Response to paclitaxel was defined as a reduction of KI67 positive cells by more than 10% (r2 = 0.33; slope = 0.26 \u00b1 0.09; P = 0.015) or induction of TUNEL positive cells by more than 20% (r2 = 0.68; slope = 0.76 \u00b1 0.15; P < 0.001).Tissue slices from lung carcinomas were incubated with or without cisplatinum. Figure 5a shows representative examples of tumors with (left panel) or without (right panel) cellular response to cisplatinum as analyzed by KI67 and TUNEL staining. With respect to cell growth, the stromal compartment was less active in lung cancer tissues compared to that observed in breast cancer tissues. Consequently, in lung cancer a cisplatinum-dependent reduction of KI67 positive cells was unique to tumor cells and was observed in 9 of 16 cases (Fig. 5b, left panel). An increase of TUNEL positive cells was observed only in a minority of lung cancer specimens. In 2 cases both the stromal and the tumor cells responded to cisplatinum (Fig. 5b, right panel).Effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on stroma and tumor cells in tissues from lung cancer patients. Tumor tissue slices from 16 patients with primary lung cancer were incubated with or without cisplatinum for 72 hours, then fixed in formalin and analyzed for proliferation and cell death using KI67 and TUNEL immunohistochemistry. (a) Representative examples of KI67 and TUNEL stained sections from tissues with cellular response (left panel) and non-response (right panel). Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. (b) Percentage of KI67 (left histograms) and TUNEL (right histograms) positive cells of both the tumor (upper panel) and the stromal compartment (middle panel) was assessed using a \u00d740 objective. Three to 7 randomly selected fields were examined for each section. The correlation of tumor and stromal response to cisplatinum regarding changes in proliferation and cell death is shown in the lower panels of the figure. Response to cisplatinum was defined as a reduction of KI67 positive cells by more than 10% or induction of TUNEL positive cells by more than 20%.DiscussionDespite its wide clinical use, the exact mechanisms causing tumor regression after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents are poorly understood. Successful chemotherapy leads to death of malignant cells as well as carcinoma associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Whether death of the cancer cell itself is the primary event in the cascade leading to tumor regression remains unclear. In addition, the contribution of the stromal cells to treatment outcome is yet not understood. Our data demonstrate for the first time that not only tumor cells but also CAFs are targeted by cytotoxic chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we found that response to treatment of CAFs from different tumors is highly variable.Several classification systems have been used to assess the pathological response of tumor cells to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [reviewed in 27]. Anecdotal evidence has also been published for chemotherapy-induced changes of the stromal compartment. However, studies focusing on the effects of chemotherapy on stromal cells are not available. In our in vivo studies, a stromal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was detected in those cases with a reactive stroma before treatment. This stromal regression was independent of tumor cell response implying that both of the tumor compartments can be targeted by chemotherapy despite a lack of response of the other compartment. However, because of the time lag between neoadjuvant chemotherapy cessation and surgery, it is not possible to examine direct effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the different cell compartments in this in vivo study setting. We therefore performed in vitro experiments with primary cultivated CAFs isolated from newly diagnosed breast and lung carcinomas allowing a comparative study of the cytotoxic response of CAFs to different chemotherapeutic agents.Orimo et al. demonstrated that isolated fibroblasts from tumors maintain their CAF specific phenotype and their capability to proliferate over at least 10 passages in vitro even if epithelial carcinoma cells are not continuously present. In line with this, the CAFs used in the present experiments exhibited a constant proliferation rate over ~10 passages (data not shown). All investigated CAFs were found to be resistant to paclitaxel when compared to a panel of 22 well established cancer cell lines. The CAFs from breast cancer were also mostly resistant to cisplatinum. Only 1 out of 6 tested CAFs from breast cancer showed an intermediate response to this agent. In line with these results, Hawsawi et al. found only 1 of 10 CAFs from breast cancer to be sensitive to cisplatinum. In contrast, we found a remarkable variability of response to cisplatinum in CAFs isolated from lung carcinoma specimens. The GI50 concentrations of cisplatinum ranging from 2.8 to 28 \u03bcM were comparable to those obtained in the tumor cell line panel (3.3 to 30.6 \u03bcM). Altogether, we conclude that: (1) CAFs respond differently to cisplatinum and paclitaxel; (2) the response of CAFs to cisplatinum shows variability similar to different tumor cell lines; and, (3) CAFs from different organs differ in their response.Potential causes for the variable response of different CAFs to cisplatinum may be mutations and/or polymorphisms affecting genes involved in DNA damage response mechanisms such as the p53 pathway. Evidence for possible alterations in p53 pathway in CAFs has been provided by several recently published studies. Hawsawi et al. demonstrated that irradiation-induced levels of p53 and p21 are diminished in CAFs when compared to fibroblasts from normal tissues. In addition, several retrospective studies using paraffin-embedded material as source for DNA have reported a high frequency of functional TP53 mutations in the microdissected stromal compartment derived from various carcinomas such as breast, ovarian and colon. We did not find any evidence for somatic TP53 mutations in the CAFs isolated from 28 lung carcinoma patients included in our study. These results indicate that the presence of TP53 mutations in CAFs is limited to certain tumor entities such as breast and colon whereas CAFs from other entities such as lung remain wild type TP53. This would imply that the reaction of CAFs to cytotoxic agents and their influence on therapy response are fundamentally different in different organs. However, since many of the studies reporting on high frequencies of somatic mutations in stromal cells have relied on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded material, it can not be ruled out that the identified mutations may be a reflection of methodological limitations. The latter hypothesis is supported by recently published studies by Allinen et al. and Qui et al.. Qui et al. investigated isolated CAFs and frozen tissues and showed that somatic mutations in CAFs from breast and ovarian carcinomas are extremely rare. Allinen et al. separated myofibroblasts and epithelial tumor cells from fresh breast tumor tissues and found no genetic alterations in myofibroblasts whereas numerous chromosomal gains and losses were detected in the epithelial fractions. We further examined if the variable sensitivity to cisplatinum observed in CAFs from lung cancer could be attributed to functional polymorphisms in genes critical for cellular response to cisplatinum such as TP53, ERCC1, and Mdm2. It has been shown that cells with the TP53 Arg/Arg genotype induce apoptosis significantly better than with Pro/Pro genotype. The ERCC1 Codon 118 polymorphism is associated with different mRNA levels and high levels have been associated with a shorter overall survival for colon carcinoma patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Various studies have shown that the G-allele of the polymorphism Mdm2-309T/G in the promoter of the Mdm2 gene is associated with high levels of Mdm2 protein and attenuation of the p53 DNA damage response induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Our data show that none of these polymorphisms is significantly correlated with sensitivity to cisplatinum in CAFs from lung cancer. However, we observed a non-significant trend towards decreased sensitivity in the presence of the TP53 variant genotype which may be one mechanism contributing to the variable response to cisplatinum in CAFs from lung. Due to the limited number of CAFs included in our study, a final conclusion of potential relevant effects of these polymorphisms on the sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs can not be drawn.Despite the observation that isolated CAFs retain their cancer promoting phenotype in vitro , they may behave differently with respect to DNA damage response within the tumor tissue. There is growing evidence that the cellular environment has an important influence on cellular viability. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions responsible for this impact have been studied extensively in 2D and 3D in vitro culture models, in spheroid models and in co-culture experiments using tumor cell lines and fibroblasts. However, these model systems have some limitations since cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are extremely complex and specific for each individual tumor in vivo . Therefore, we have used a tissue slice culture system which allows the examination of short term effects of chemotherapy on CAFs within their natural environment of the tumor tissue. In tissue cultures from breast carcinomas, paclitaxel-related death of the stromal cell compartment was observed showing an increase of up to 70% apoptotic cells within 72 hours. An interesting finding is that this short term exposure to paclitaxel led to a parallel reaction of both tumor and stromal cells in tissue culture experiments whereas isolated cultured CAFs from breast tumors turned out to be resistant to paclitaxel. These results indicate that within sensitive cancer tissues paclitaxel is highly efficient for compromising the tumor cell compartment and consecutively affecting stroma cells. Within tissue culture, survival of CAFs may be more dependent on supportive factors provided by the individual tumor environment. In contrast, optimized single cell culture conditions for isolated fibroblasts may protect the cells in a more artificial manner. The central role of the microenvironment for response of CAFs to cytotoxic drugs is also demonstrated by our results obtained with lung cancer tissues. In lung cancer, CAFs behave significantly different in cell versus tissue culture. The KI67 positive fraction of CAFs in tissues was extremely low whereas isolated CAFs showed a constantly high proliferation. Accordingly, CAFs in tissue turned out to be much less sensitive to cisplatinum when compared to the isolated CAFs. These observations indicate that, in addition to intrinsic factors, the microenvironment determines the sensitivity of CAFs to cytotoxic therapy.ConclusionIn conclusion, our in vivo and in vitro data indicate that stromal reaction is an integral component of tumor response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms influence the variable responses of the stromal compartment to cytotoxic agents. The importance of this variability on the clinical outcome of the carcinoma should be the focus of further investigations.Abbreviations(CAFs): Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts; (GI): growth inhibition; (ECM): extracellular matrix; (FCS): fetal calf serum; (FAP): fibroblast activation protein; (ESA): epithelial specific antigen; (H&E): Haematoxylin & Eosin; (\u03bcM): micro molar; (PCR): polymerase chain reaction; (RFLP): Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism; (cCR): clinical complete responders; (cNR): clinical non responders; (cPR): clinical partial responders; (MRT): magnetic resonance tomography; (SNP): single nucleotide polymorphism; (TUNEL): TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMS, HvdK, TEM, and WEA designed the study and have been involved in drafting the manuscript.

We tested the role of fibroblasts in fatty acids metabolism in breast cancer, addressing fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression and activity, the expression of lipids chaperons (FABPs) and transporters (FATPs) and lipids cellular content. We showed that the amount of lipids increased in cancer cells exposed to fibroblasts conditioned media, showing that lipids transfer is crucial in this metabolic cross-talk. Accordingly, it was seen in those cancer cells a concomitant decrease in the expression of FABP2 and FABP3 and an increase in FATP1 expression, whose function is independent of FABPs. The in\u00a0vivo experiment corroborates the role of CAFs in tumor growth. Our study is one more step toward the understanding of metabolic dynamics between cancer cells and CAFs, disclosing FATP1 as a putative target to disturb the transfer of lipids between CAFs and breast cancer cells.",

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

        "title": "Experimental generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

Since the origin of the stromal cells in the tumor is unknown, we have examined differences and similarities between three stromal cell types of mesenchymal origin, namely carcinoma associated fibroblasts from breast tumor (CAFs), fibroblasts from normal breast area (NFs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In a microarray analysis, immunological, developmental and extracellular matrix -related pathways were over-represented in CAFs when compared to NFs (p&lt;0.001). Under hypoxic conditions, the expression levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) were lower in CAFs when compared to NFs (fold changes 0.6 and 0.4, respectively). In normoxia, when compared to NFs, CAFs displayed increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and PDK1 (fold changes 1.5 and 1.3, respectively). With respect to the assessed surface markers, only CD105 was expressed differently in MSCs when compared to fibroblasts, being more often expressed on MSCs. Cells with myofibroblast features were present in both NF and CAF samples. We conclude, that CAFs differ distinctly from NFs at the gene expression level, this hypothesis was also tested in silico for other available gene expression data.",

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

Although, additional experiments using other human breast cancer cell lines (e.g., MCF-7, BT-20) with varying Zn protein characteristics are required, the results highlight differences between in vitro and in vivo Zn isotope fractionation.IntroductionOver the last decade analysis of natural metal isotopes has emerged as an interdisciplinary field of substantial biomedical potential, including diagnosis and defining disease mechanisms. Compared to metabolic studies where radioactive and single isotope tracers are used to monitor concentration changes, high precision measurements of natural isotopic fractionations are especially useful because they can inform on mechanisms, e.g., why changes in concentration occur due to altered uptake, secretion or excretion. Two recently published breast cancer studies found that Zn dyshomeostasis linked to carcinogenesis is reflected in enrichment of light Zn isotopes in malignant breast tissue compared to adjacent histologically healthy tissue.Zinc homeostasis in humans is maintained by multiple proteins which tightly regulate intracellular Zn concentrations. Among these proteins are influx-controlling Zn importers (SLC39A; ZIP1-ZIP14), efflux-controlling Zn transporters (SLC30A; ZnT1-ZnT10), and Zn-sequestering proteins (e.g., metallothionein) [e.g., ]. Histidine-, glutamate-, aspartate- and cysteine-residues serve as binding ligands for Zn in these proteins. In general, histidine-rich loops form the primary Zn-binding sites of ZIPs and ZnTs, while Zn-binding on metallothionein occurs on cysteine-rich ligands. Cancer-induced Zn dyshomeostasis has been related to up- or down-regulation of Zn proteins and changes in their coordination and ligand chemistry. For breast cancer, upregulation of ZIP6, ZIP7, ZIP10, ZnT2 and overexpression of metallothionein have been proposed to implicate higher Zn levels in malignant relative to healthy tissue.Isotopic fractionation of Zn isotopes in cells is linked to coordination chemistry. Lower atomic weight is associated with lower bond energy, so heavier isotopes are enriched in the strongest ligand bonds, assuming equilibrium isotope fractionation. Thus, cysteine (S-ligands) preferentially binds isotopically light Zn, while normally tighter binding histidine (N-ligands) and aspartate (O-ligands) preferentially complex isotopically heavy Zn. If the normal Zn-ligand binding environments are disturbed by Zn dyshomeostasis, isotopic compositions in various body reservoirs (e.g., blood, urine, tissue) can be perturbed. Thus, Zn isotope analysis of clinical samples could be a method to probe the role of Zn uptake and secretion in cancer development and progression.In vitro cell lines are powerful simplified models to study processes at the molecular and cellular levels including the study of cancer-induced isotopic fractionation. Various human cell lines have been used to better understand uptake and transport mechanisms causing isotope fractionation of copper, iron, uranium and Zn. Differentiated neuron-like cells (SH-SY5Y) preferentially incorporate and accumulate light isotopes of copper, uranium, and Zn. Similar observations have been made for differentiated intestinal (Caco-2) cells showing the preferential uptake of isotopically light iron. Under oxidative stress, however, cancerous liver cells incorporate copper that is isotopically heavy. These observations contradict the expected correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies on metal ion isotope fractionation.There is little information about the processes at the molecular and cellular level causing systematic enrichment of light Zn isotopes in malignant breast tissue. Our work aimed to improve the mechanistic understanding of the isotopic behavior of Zn in breast cancer, with the long-term objective of biomarker development. We conducted experiments using in vitro breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231) spiked with isotopically-natural Zn and determined the isotopic fractionation induced due to active uptake and efflux. The results highlight differences between in vitro and in vivo Zn isotope processing and will inform future studies on using Zn isotope fractionation as a biomarker (Figure 1).Schematic of overall approach for biomedical studies to investigate metal stable isotope fractionation.MethodsCell ProliferationThe cell proliferation experiments were conducted to investigate if isotopic mass controls cell growth. Isotopically enriched metal powders of 64Zn (>99.00 %) and 68Zn (>99.00 %) (Isoflex, San Francisco, CA, US) were dissolved separately in 6 M HCl. Chloride solutions were diluted with 18 M\u03a9 cm purified H2O (MilliQ) to make 10 mM ZnCl2 solutions which were then added to the exposure medium. The exposure medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco Life, heat inactivated) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) + 10 mM ZnCl2 solution was combined, adjusted to pH 7.4 if necessary and then equilibrated overnight. This exposure medium was added over two passages of MDA-MB-231 cells to enable full isotopic equilibration. At a cell density of 1 \u00d7 105, cells were seeded in six well-plates (n = 4) for negative control (0 \u03bcM Zn, -ve), positive control (20 \u03bcM Zn, +ve), isotopically light (20 \u03bcM, 64Zn) and isotopically heavy (20 \u03bcM, 68Zn) exposures and grown under normal oxygen conditions. The cells were counted at 48, 72, and 96 h using a Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelom Bioscience, MA, US) to monitor the growth rate. To ensure constant cell proliferation the exposure media were refreshed after 48 h for the cells growing for 72 or 96 h.Uptake-Efflux ExperimentCell CulturingIn our uptake-efflux experiment, MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) cells were first cultured under sterile conditions inside a class II biological safety cabinet at 37\u00b0C. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco Life, heat inactivated) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) without Zn addition. After 48 h, the cells were transferred to petri dishes containing medium without additional Zn. At this step cells were grown on microscopic slides until they reached 105 cells/cm2. Microscopic slides with MDA-MB-231 were transferred to media spiked with 15 \u03bcM isotopically natural Zn solution. A concentration of 15 \u03bcM ZnCl2 was selected as it is within the reference range of intracellular and plasma homeostatic Zn (11\u201324 \u03bcM). As \u201cfree\u201d Zn is toxic to cells, even at nanomolar levels, we added Zn complexed with histidine (Zn-His), a stable octahedral compound. MDA-MB-231 cells on microscopic slides were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C before being transferred to the drip flow biofilm reactor for the efflux experiment.Efflux ExperimentFigure 2 shows the experimental setup for the efflux experiment using a drip flow-through biofilm reactor (BioSurface Technologies, Corp., USA). The experiment was conducted in a class II biological safety cabinet. Prior conducting the efflux experiment with a cell line, the setup was tested for Zn blanks using a 20 mM metal-free HEPES input solution. The polysulfone drip flow-through biofilm reactor has a 10\u00b0 inclination and consists of four chambers. The 20 mM metal-free HEPES input fluid was supplied through four channels imposed by a peristaltic pump and ran through the system for 1 and 2.5 h, respectively, and the effluent was collected separately for each channel.Schematic of the cell uptake-efflux experiment. A HEPES solution from the Tedlar bags is pumped to the drip flow-through reactor (1 ml min\u22121, as controlled by a peristaltic pump). The drip flow-through reactor contains 4 microscopic slides with MDA-MB-231 cells pre-grown in medium spiked with 15 \u03bcM Zn-histidine (Zn-His). Effluent samples were taken for 0.5 h in metal-free 50 mL centrifuge tubes.For the cell line efflux experiment, microscopic slides with cells cultured for 24 h in Zn-His spiked medium were washed three times with 20 mM metal-free HEPES solution before placed in the drip flow-through biofilm reactor to remove detached cells. This step ensured that the collected effluent solution of the efflux experiment only contained Zn excreted by the cells. The initial cell density and initial Zn isotope composition of these cells prior to the efflux experiments were determined by harvesting the cells from a microscopic slide with trypsin (Lonza). The harvested cells were counted using the Cellometer Auto T4 cell counter (Nexcelom, Bioscience). The 20 mM metal-free HEPES solution was directly dripped onto the cells with a rate of 1 ml min\u22121. Due to inclination of the drip flow-through reactor the residence time of the fluid passing the chambers was extremely short (<1 min) resulting in short contact time of the fluid and the cells. The effluent was collected in 30 min intervals in acid-washed metal-free centrifuge tubes (VWR). After the experiment, the cells on the microscopic slides were harvested using trypsin. Harvested cells, effluent and aliquots of the medium, and starting input HEPES solution were stored at \u221220\u00b0C, until required.Prior to isotope analysis, harvested cells were lysed using a MARS 5 Digestion Microwave System (CEM Corp., UK). The harvested cell suspension was transferred in acid cleaned XP-1500 Plus (PTFE) vessels and 3 ml of quartz sub-boiled distilled nitric acid (15.4 N) and 2 ml hydrogen peroxide (Romil Ltd) were added. A blank sample consisting of only 3 ml of nitric acid and 2 ml hydrogen peroxide was processed for quality control. The samples were pre-digested at room temperature overnight. Microwave-assisted acid digestion was performed by ramping up the temperature stepwise to 210\u00b0C and 250 psi over 60 min, and held there for 30 min to ensure complete digestion.For Zn isotope analysis, all samples (e.g., acid-digested cells, efflux solution) were double-spiked consisting of mixture of 64Zn and 67Zn. The double-spike mixture had a 64Zn/67Zn = 4.2336 and was added to each sample in an ideal sample/spike mixture of 1. To ensure the ideal sample/spike mixture, a small sample aliquot (20 \u03bcl) was spiked with an appropriate volume of 64Zn + 67Zn spike and the sample Zn concentration was determined by isotope dilution. Once sample-Zn was known, a larger aliquot of the sample was prepared for Zn isotopic analysis. Zinc was separated and purified using AG-MP1 resin (BioRad, 100\u2013200 mesh) following the method described by. The Zn columns with 250 \u03bcl AG-MP1 resin were rinsed with 10 mL of each 0.1N HNO3 and double-deionized water, conditioned with 6N HCl, and equilibrated with 4 x 0.5 ml 1N HCl. The spiked sample re-dissolved in 1 ml 1N HCl was loaded on the column and subsequently rinsed with 8 mL of 1N HCl. In the last step, 6 mL of 0.01N HCl was added to elute Zn from the column. Procedural blanks and Zn standard solutions (IRMM-3702, London-Zn) were processed in the same way as samples. The Zn isotope ratios and precise elemental Zn concentrations were measured with Nu Plasma HR-multiple-collector ICP-MS by double-spike and sample-standard bracketing techniques. All Zn isotope values were expressed as delta notation [\u03b466Zn (\u2030)] relative to the JMC-Lyon:The extent of isotope fractionation was determined and described as:where \u039466Znuptake reflects Zn isotope fractionation for Zn taken up by cells (\u03b466Zncells) from Zn-His spiked medium (\u03b466Znmedium) after incubation for 24 h, and Zn isotope fractionation of the efflux (\u039466Znefflux) is described as:based on the difference between Zn isotopic composition of cells after incubation for 24 h (\u03b466Zncells) and the Zn isotopic composition of the effluent (\u03b466Zneffluent) collected for 0.5 h.The in-house London Zn was used as standard for sample-standard bracketing and the precision of the unprocessed London Zn solution was \u00b1 0.04\u2030 (n = 26) over two analytical days. The precision of \u03b466Zn for processed pure Zn IRMM-3702 reference material was \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.08\u2030 (2SD, n = 6). If not stated otherwise, the precision of 2SD for \u03b466Zn (\u2030) refers to repeated analysis of London Zn bracketing standards.ResultsZinc Isotope Enrichment Proliferation TestsFigure 3 shows the average cell growth of MDA-MB-231 in a 64Zn and 68Zn isotope enriched medium as well as the control without Zn (-ve) and natural Zn (+ve). In all experiments, regardless of the isotopic composition of the Zn in solution, the cell density increased by 5-fold within 96 h reaching an average density of 5.3 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 105 cells. If cell growth is driven by the mass of an isotope, we would expect to see faster growth for the lighter isotopes compared t the heavier isotopes of Zn (Figure 3 and Table 1).Zinc isotope enrichment proliferation after 96 h under different medium Zn conditions: -ve control = negative control without Zn; +ve control = positive control with 20 \u03bcM \u201cnatural\u201d Zn; 64-Zinc = 20 \u03bcM 64Zn and 68-Zinc = 20\u03bcM 68Zn only.Data summary for Zn isotope enrichment proliferation tests.Experimentalcondition\tTime(hrs)\tAverage(x105 cells)\tStdev(x105 cells)\t \t-ve control\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t-ve control\t48\t1.82\t0.66\t \t-ve control\t72\t3.30\t0.93\t \t-ve control\t96\t5.94\t1.49\t \t+ve control\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t+ve control\t48\t1.42\t0.40\t \t+ve control\t72\t3.39\t1.74\t \t+ve control\t96\t5.20\t0.79\t \t64Zn\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t64Zn\t48\t1.86\t0.05\t \t64Zn\t72\t3.21\t0.99\t \t64Zn\t96\t5.35\t1.61\t \t68Zn\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t68Zn\t48\t0.93\t0.54\t \t68Zn\t72\t2.98\t1.62\t \t68Zn\t96\t4.60\t1.68\t \t-ve control\t96\t5.94\t1.49\t \t+ve control\t96\t5.20\t0.79\t \t64Zn\t96\t5.35\t1.61\t \t68Zn\t96\t4.60\t1.68\t \tCell EffluxControl of blank levels. We assessed blank contributions because Zn usually has a high background level, which can significantly alter the measured isotopic composition. The microwave control blank was 0.9 ng Zn ml\u22121 and procedural blanks for the anion exchange chromatography were 0.24 \u00b1 0.20 ng Zn ml\u22121 (n = 4). The Zn blank for the experimental setup ranged between 0.5 and 2.7 ng Zn ml\u22121 after 1 h effluent collection and decreased to 0.6\u20131.4 ng Zn ml\u22121 after 2.5 h (Table 2). This corresponds to 0.7\u20134.8% of Zn (mean: 1.9 \u00b1 2.0% Zn) collected in the effluent of the cell line efflux experiment. The sum of all blanks (microwave, procedural and efflux) corresponds to 0.008 and 0.81% of the initial Zn in medium and harvested cells before the efflux experiment. This observation demonstrates that precise and reliable Zn isotope data can be achieved for cell line experiments using the drip flow-through biofilm reactor.Data summary for uptake-efflux experiment.Experiment\tSampletype\tTime(h)\tFlow reactorchannel\tZn concentration(ng/ml)\t% Zn rel.efflux\tNumber ofanalysis\t \tBlank test\tFluid\t1\t1\tNA\t\t\u2013\t \t\tFluid\t1\t2\t0.48\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t1\t3\t2.09\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t1\t4\t2.66\t\t1\t \tBlank test\tFluid\t2.5\t1\t0.68\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t2.5\t2\t1.38\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t2.5\t3\t0.55\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t2.5\t4\tNA\t\t\u2013\t \tExperiment\tSample type\tTime (h)\tFlow reactor channel\tZn concentration(ng/ml)\t\u03b466ZnIRMM3702(\u2030)\tNumber of analysis\t \tEfflux\tFluid\t0.5\t1\t105\t\u22120.19 (0.05)\t1\t \t\tFluid\t0.5\t2\t40\t\u22120.07 (0.04)\t1\t \t\tFluid\t0.5\t3\t70\t\u22120.11 (0.05)\t1\t \t\tFluid\t0.5\t4\t55\tNA\t1\t \tInitial Zn medium\tFluid\t0\t\t\t\u22120.03 (0.07)\t2\t \tCells before efflux\tSolid\t\u2013\t\t302\t+0.2 (0.07)\t1\t \tIRMM-3702 (processed)\t\t\t\t\t\u22120.13 (0.08)\t6\t \tMass balance. Our current experimental design does not allow for a complete isotopic mass balance. Cellular concentrations and isotopic changes of Zn can only be monitored assuming a similar distribution and behavior of cells on each microscopic slide. Based on the Zn concentration of harvested cells from two microscopic slides, we calculated that about 0.15% of total 15 \u03bcM Zn from the medium was incorporated into MDA-MB-231 cells. With an initial MDA-MB-231 cell density of 2.6 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 0.62 \u00d7 106 cells (n = 2), the Zn uptake yielded in 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 nM Zn/cell (= accounting for 5.4 \u00d7 109 Zn atoms/cell). The initial medium spiked with isotopic naturally-distributed 15 \u03bcM Zn-His had a \u03b466Zn of \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.02\u2030 (2 SD, n = 2). MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 15 \u03bcM Zn-His had a \u25b366Zn of +0.20\u2030 prior to the efflux experiment. The intracellular Zn of MDA-MB-231 is isotopically heavier compared to the initial medium (\u039466Znuptake = +0.23 \u00b1 0.1\u2030; 2SD, Figure 4). Zinc in the effluent collected from four channels corresponds to 4.03 \u00b1 1.66 \u00d7 10\u22127 nM Zn/cell (= accounting for 2.4 \u00d7 108 Zn atoms/cell). The \u03b466Zn of the efflux solutions collected from the four channels range between \u22120.07 and \u22120.19\u2030 with an average of \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.12\u2030 (2 SD).Possible pathways that may lead to Zn isotope fractionation (\u039466Zn) based on the uptake-efflux experiment with the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Zn was provided as Zn complexed with histidine (Zn-His). Zn isotope fractionation by cell uptake (\u039466Znuptake) can be caused by (1) active import of Zn-His via Zn importer proteins (ZIP) or (2) non-quantitative diffusion of Zn via unspecified channels. Zn isotope fractionation via efflux (\u039466Znefflux) of Zn out of the cells can be caused by (1) active export of Zn-His via Zn transporter proteins (ZnT) or (2) non-quantitative diffusion of Zn via unspecified channels.DiscussionThe results show nearly identical proliferation of MDA-MB-231 under single isotope and natural Zn exposure conditions; these observations demonstrate that isotopic mass does not control cell growth. The addition of 20 \u03bcM Zn did not enhance or suppress the proliferation, as the cell density for light (64Zn) or heavy (68Zn) isotopically spiked Zn conditions are similar to those for the no-Zn control and Zn with natural isotope composition (Figure 3).Metabolism in cancerous breast tissue is generally thought to be enhanced in order to provide sufficient energy and anabolic substrate for proliferation. Adaptation in Zn-protein expression in neoplasms is not driven by preferential uptake of any Zn isotopologue. This means that the isotopic shift reported in breast tumors likely reflects metabolic changes for Zn in cancerous breast cells, and not an energetic advantage related to the isotopic composition possessed by the neoplasm. As such, observed isotopic shifts in breast cancer tissue can be used purely as a monitor of neoplastic driven metabolic changes. Furthermore, single stable isotope tracer studies are established as providing better insight into the processes under investigation without inducing or exacerbating pathological processes.Notably, our MDA-MB-231 cell line analyses show isotopic fractionations in the opposite direction to those determined for in vivo breast cancer tissue samples. Malignant breast tumors have significantly lower \u03b466Zn than healthy tissues which has been interpreted as an indicator for increased metallothionein expression. The difference in Zn isotope fractionation observed between in vitro MDA-MB-231 cell line experiments and in vivo breast tissue might be due to differences in Zn transporter levels or intercellular Zn storage mechanisms (e.g., metallothionein expression).A positive direction of Zn isotope fractionation for the cell uptake (\u039466Znuptake = +0.23 \u00b1 0.1\u2030, 2SD, n = 2) can be mechanistically explained by Zn adsorption, diffusion through non-selective channels into the cell or an active cell uptake via ZIP proteins. Adsorption studies on bacterial cells and biofilms show preferential binding of heavy Zn isotopes with equilibrium isotopic fractionation between +0.50 and +1.30\u2030. However, adsorption may be less likely in our studies as the 2:1 Zn (His)2 complexes are uncharged and cells were rinsed with metal-free HEPES to remove any loosely adsorbed Zn. Instead, the preferential uptake of 66Zn by MDA-MB-231 may reflect previously reported upregulation of histidine-rich ZIPs in breast cancer cells. ZIP proteins (ZIP1-ZIP14) control intracellular Zn levels by transporting Zn into the cells across the cell membrane. Upregulation of ZIPs has been observed in most cancers to meet the demand of increased rate of proliferation and metabolism. An indicator for ZIP upregulation is one-order of magnitude higher Zn uptake of 5.4 \u00d7 109 Zn atoms/cells by MDA-MB-231 in our experiments compared to Zn required by mammalian cells (108 Zn atoms/cell).Zinc isotope fractionation for Zn uptake by cells can be associated with Zn speciation, Zn-binding domains of proteins or exchange reactions. A study with neuron-like cells showed a preferential uptake of light 64Zn with an isotopic fractionation of 1.14\u2030. However, uptake and efflux of Zn-His should not fractionate Zn isotopes due to a lack in coordination change for complexed Zn species. Caldelas and Weiss, however, argued that non-quantitative uptake of complexed Zn can result in an enrichment of 66Zn in plant cells. We can assume a similar isotopic effects of non-quantitative uptake for Zn-His because only 0.15% of Zn from the medium has been taken up by MDA-MB-231 cells. However, our data cannot directly resolve whether diffusion through non-selective channels or uptake via ZIPs, or other proteins, is the predominant pathway for Zn uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells.Negative \u039466Znefflux suggests diffusion via non-selective channels. During diffusion light 64Zn diffuses faster out of the cell than 66Zn. The efflux experiment shows that MDA-MB-231 cells preferentially 'excrete' light 64Zn with \u039466Znefflux of \u22120.42 \u00b1 0.12\u2030 (Figure 4). An existing concentration gradient with high Zn in cells and no Zn in the efflux solution may allow diffusion of Zn-His via non-selective channels. Coutaud et al. reported preferential excretion of lighter Zn isotopes with \u039466Zn of \u22120.50 \u00b1 0.20\u2030 due to desorption from the biofilm. Also, lighter Zn isotopes can diffuse faster through biological membranes or due to a gradient within the boundary layer. This leaves the cell culture enriched in heavy 66Zn over time resulting in opposite isotopic signal of what has been observed for in vivo malignant breast tissue. These in vivo studies found that Zn isotope compositions are about 0.17\u2030 lower in malignant breast than healthy tissues.The ZnTs family (ZnT1-ZnT10) regulates intracellular Zn levels by transporting Zn from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space. To decrease the toxic effects of high Zn in breast cancer cells, ZnT1 is overexpressed to prevent apoptotic cell death and increase Zn secretion. Wang et al. observed that the mRNA expression level of ZnT-1 increases significantly in MDA-MB-231 cells when they are exposed to Zn sulfate. In vivo, ZnTs transport only free Zn2+ across cell membranes and with that most likely isotopically heavy Zn2+ out of the cell due to their histidine-rich structure. In our experiments, however, Zn-His might be able to pass cell membranes via different channels and the diffusion out of the cell is similar to Zn-His uptake. This explains the preferential efflux of light 64Zn due to faster diffusion of light 64Zn. Obviously conducting an uptake-efflux experiment with free Zn2+ could be a better approach, but even if Zn is added to the medium as free Zn2+, culture medium contains millimolar levels of ligands (e.g., histidine, cysteine and phosphate) which rapidly complex free Zn2+. Moreover, conducting an experiment with \u201cfree\u201d Zn can result in apoptosis because \u201cfree\u201d Zn is a cell toxin at even nanomolar levels.In vivo, tumors are heterogenous, have a three-dimensional shape and are often mixed with connective tissue, immune cells, and stromal tissues. More specifically, breast cancer varies in its origin and genetic lesions, leading to distinct phenotypes which is also reflected in different ZIP and ZnT expression between various breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, we tested our findings from MDA-MB-231 in a large panel of breast cancer cell lines to further our understanding in cell lines representing patient subtypes (Table 3). Using a well-defined list of human ZnT and ZIP proteins, we identified ten Zn proteins which are differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted P < 0.1) in MDA-MB-231 compared to other basal-like breast cancer cell lines (e.g., Her2, Luminal A and Luminal B) (Table 3). It shows that more ZIPs and ZnTs are up- than downregulated which might explain the high uptake and efflux. Other studies on the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines T-47D and MCF-7 showed that ZnT2 and metallothionein are overexpressed, providing protection from Zn hyperaccumulation and preventing apoptosis by either removing Zn from the cell or redistributing it among cellular compartments. Consequently, whether breast cancer cell lines and the experimental approach with initially ligand complexed Zn (Zn-His) reflect that of in vivo carcinoma remains an important issue to resolve before drawing any reliable conclusion on Zn isotope fractionation in clinical samples.Differential gene expression analysis for ZnTs and ZIPs between the basal-like (including MDA-MB-231) and other breast cancer cell lines (Her2, Luminal A and Luminal B).Protein codinggene\tProteins\tlogFC\tP-value\tQ-value\tDirectionof expression\t \tSLC39A6\tZIP6\t\u22121.172\t0.001\t0.007\tDown\t \tSLC39A9\tZIP9\t\u22120.521\t0.000\t0.001\tDown\t \tSLC39A11\tZIP11\t\u22120.899\t0.000\t0.003\tDown\t \tSLC30A9\tZnT9\t\u22120.318\t0.036\t0.095\tDown\t \tSLC39A4\tZIP4\t0.899\t0.012\t0.041\tUp\t \tSLC39A8\tZIP8\t0.952\t0.010\t0.040\tUp\t \tSLC39A10\tZIP10\t0.430\t0.040\t0.095\tUp\t \tSLC39A14\tZIP14\t0.938\t0.010\t0.040\tUp\t \tSLC30A3\tZnT3\t0.769\t0.006\t0.033\tUp\t \tSLC30A6\tZnT6\t0.243\t0.036\t0.095\tUp\t \tSLC30A5\tZnT5\t\u22120.226\t0.068\t0.148\tNormal\t \tSLC30A10\tZnT10\t0.113\t0.079\t0.158\tNormal\t \tSLC39A12\tZIP12\t0.021\t0.137\t0.254\tNormal\t \tSLC39A2\tZIP2\t0.373\t0.153\t0.262\tNormal\t \tSLC30A4\tZnT4\t\u22120.207\t0.320\t0.510\tNormal\t \tSLC39A7\tZIP7\t\u22120.164\t0.356\t0.510\tNormal\t \tSLC39A1\tZIP1\t\u22120.162\t0.361\t0.510\tNormal\t \tSLC39A13\tZIP13\t\u22120.194\t0.419\t0.558\tNormal\t \tSLC30A8\tZnT8\t0.146\t0.522\t0.659\tNormal\t \tSLC30A2\tZnT2\t0.095\t0.555\t0.667\tNormal\t \tSLC39A5\tZIP5\t\u22120.027\t0.653\t0.706\tNormal\t \tSLC30A7\tZnT7\t0.062\t0.687\t0.706\tNormal\t \tSLC39A3\tZIP3\t0.061\t0.701\t0.706\tNormal\t \tSLC30A1\tZnT1\t0.081\t0.706\t0.706\tNormal\t \tFC, fold change; For each gene, log2FC was calculated as the difference in means of mRNA abundance between the basal-like and other cell lines.

Blue: Downregulated ZnTs and ZIPs in MDA-MB-23 relative to other basal-like breast cancer cell lines. Green: Upregulated ZnTs and ZIPs in MDA-MB-23 relative to other basal-like breast cancer cell lines.Future DirectionsOur results support the relevance of in vitro cell culture models to identify and understand factors driving changes in Zn isotopic composition caused by cancer development and progression. However, with respect to in vivo relevance, the results should be regarded as preliminary, and additional experiments are required using other human breast cancer cell lines, e.g., MCF-7, BT-20, with different expressions of ZnT and ZIP (Table 1). This is important, because, for instance, upregulation of ZIP6 in estrogen treated MCF-7 (Table 1) might lead to more pronounced uptake of heavy 66Zn. As almost every cancer is unique, it may be advantageous to determine average Zn isotope fractionation for cancer cells based on Zn biology (e.g., MT expression, ZnT and ZIP regulation, cell growth rate) moreover the use of 3D cell cultures as spheroids may be a representative approach and enable other stromal cell types to be incorporated into the workstream.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Author ContributionsKS and FL designed the experiments.

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u00b5l trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes. Total histone proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an acetylated lysine antibody (Millipore).DNA affinity precipitation assaySCP2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated siRNAs were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes.

Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equipment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s).

After two days, 25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity.

The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

        "content": "Carboxymethyl Benzylamide Dextran (CMDB7) displayed an in vitro growth inhibitory activity on breast tumor cells. CMDB7 is able to disrupt the interaction of angiogenic growth factors (FGF2, TGF beta and PDGF) with their membrane receptors. This compound blocks the angiogenesis of MDA-MB435 carcinoma xenografted in mammary fat pad and their lung metastases in nude mice. In this work, we studied the uptake of CMDB7 labeled with 99mTc in cultured human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line and the highly tumorigenic MCF-7ras cell line (Ha-ras-transfected MCF-7 cells) and the in vivo distribution in MCF-7ras tumor-bearing mice. The 99mTc-CMDB7 are stable and the intracellular concentration is time-dependent and reaches a plateau at 180 minutes. 99mTc CMDB7 uptake is much higher in MCF-7ras cells than MCF-7 cells. Since CMDB7 is internalized and could also inhibit cell proliferation by acting at nuclear sites, we investigated the MCF-7ras nuclear localization after cell fractionation. Cell fractionation revealed a cytoplasmic and nuclear internalization of CMDB7. The tumor uptakes of 99mTc-CMDB7 were 0.34%, 0.72% and 0.62% of the administrated doses per gram of tumor tissue at 1 hour, 3 hour and 5 hours respectively after their injection. The blood clearance of 99mTc CMDB7 was very rapid and the liver, spleen and kidney uptakes were very weak. These results confirm the absence of toxicity of CMDB7 and the usefulness of CMDB7 in cancer therapy by targeting breast tumors.",

As primary and metastatic tumors grow, the secretion of a considerable number of unbalanced factors is able to trigger the formation of new vessels through the process of angiogenesis. One of these factors, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), is a key mediator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis and a validated target for antiangiogenesis therapy in the clinic. However, extensive clinical experience targeting VEGF-VEGFR agents has shown that this is not always the case. For example, several phase III clinical trials failed to provide evidence of overall survival (OS) benefit in bevacizumab arms for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Small molecule antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), mainly against VEGFR2, have not shown efficacy in breast cancer treatment until today . These considerations, combined with the observation that tumor vessels can develop resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, highlight the need to identify effective anti-angiogenesis therapies that are based on VEGF-independent targets and can be used in combination with anti-VEGF independent therapy to improve outcomes for patients.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major stromal residents and a main producer of paracrine signals, are highly involved in the development of tumors through the secretion of cytokines and angiogenic factors. On the one hand, studies have revealed that CAFs may activate multiple signaling pathways in endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis by secreting versatile signaling molecules in addition to VEGFA. CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into invasive human breast cancers, an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. Functionally, coculture of FAP-positive CAFs with endothelial cells can stimulate angiogenesis as measured by sprouting in colorectal cancer. Interestingly, CAFs from resistant EL4 tumors can also mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy via VEGF-independent PDGF-C signaling. On the other hand, the tumor stroma exhibits drastic changes at the transcriptional level, which can be useful prognostic predictors of cancer progression. Activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor STAT3 in CAFs promotes colorectal tumor development and correlates with poor prognosis. Strikingly, STAT3 effects in colorectal neoplasia may be at least partially due to modulation of proangiogenic signaling. Transcription factor ZEB1 deletion in stromal CAFs reduces the expression and secretion of a variety of paracrine signaling molecules, including FGF2, FGF7, VEGFA and IL6, to suppress tumor initiation, progression and metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer partially associated with decreased angiogenesis. However, the complicated mechanism underlying how breast CAFs promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis in transcriptional addiction is not well understood.Fos-like antigen 2 (FOSL2/FRA-2) belongs to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, which includes the various isoforms of Fos and Jun. FOSL2 exerts a specific function in bone development and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and appears to have selective physiological and pathological roles in diverse processes, including the development of immune cells and endocrinology processes. In addition, enhanced FOSL2 expression has been documented in some carcinomas, such as colon, hepatocellular, ovarian and breast cancer.Remarkably, FOSL2 transgenic mice resemble the core clinical features of SSc, as they display fibrotic and destructive microvascular manifestations of SSc. Increased local FOSL2 levels in cardiac perivascular adipose tissue (C-PVAT) possibly contribute to perivascular angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. AP-1 transcription factors (including FOSL2) act in concert to drive ischemia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) transcription, which plays an essential role in angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. However, the role of tumor stroma-derived FOSL2 signaling in tumors has not been clarified.Wnt5a, a secreted glycoprotein, belongs to the noncanonical Wnt family. Wnt5a and its downstream signaling pathway can regulate fundamental cellular processes, including specification of cell fate, proliferation, and survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that Wnt5a exhibits dual effects on tumor progression. For example, Wnt5a plays a pro-tumorigenic role in gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, in contrast to thyroid and colorectal cancer. However, the role of Wnt5a in breast cancer is controversial and depends on the availability of key receptors and intercellular interactions among different cell types. Recently, new evidence has indicated that Wnt5a may play a role in angiogenesis and chemoresistance. Our mRNA expression profile suggested high expression of Wnt5a in breast CAFs. The interesting question of whether stromal Wnt5a in breast CAFs is involved in angiogenesis remains to be determined.Here, we are the first to probe the expression patterns of FOSL2 in breast CAFs and investigate the underlying mechanism, in which FOSL2 is critical for VEGF-independent angiogenesis by transcriptionally regulating Wnt5a. Moreover, we unveiled the clinical significance of the FOSL2/Wnt5a axis to gain insights into its pro-angiogenic function in the development and progression of breast carcinoma, suggesting potential novel therapeutic strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy.Material and MethodsClinical samples, stromal fibroblast isolation, immortalization, and cell cultureHuman breast tumor tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues (at least 5 cm away from tumor) were obtained from patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. All the patients involved in this study did not receive any radiotherapy or chemotherapy previously. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.The isolation, immortalization, identification and culture of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from breast tumor patients were previously well established as described in our previous publication. NFs and CAFs were cultured in DMEM medium (GIBCO, USA) with 10% FBS (GIBCO, USA) at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.RNA interference, plasmids, and reagentsFOSL2- or Wnt5a-knockdown cells were produced by lentivirus-mediated transduction using synthetic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) oligonucleotides (GenePharama, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were used to transiently knock down CYP19A1 or FZD5 (GenePharama, Shanghai, China). The sequences of shRNA and small interfering RNA used are listed in Table S1. FOSL2 overexpressing lentivirus were purchased from GeneCopoeia (Guangzhou, China), and viral supernatant was used to infect NFs in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene according to the manufacturer's instructions.The pcDNA3.1(+)-FOSL2 plasmid was created by amplifying FOSL2 from CAFs and was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The synthesized nucleotide wild type (WT), truncated or mutant (Mut) Wnt5a promoter was inserted into pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (GenePharma, China), respectively. The reagents used in this study are as follows: the neutralizing antibody against VEGF (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech, Switzerland), 0.2 mg/mL; axitinib (Selleck, USA), 5 nM; CCK8 (Beyotime, China), 5 mg/mL; SQ22536 (Selleck, China), 100 \u00b5M; H89 (Selleck, China), 5 \u00b5M; rWnt5a (R&D Systems, USA), 5 \u00b5g/mL; BOX5 (Merck Millipore, USA), 5 \u00b5M. The usage of rWnt5a and BOX5 in xenografts was described in animal experiments in detail.RNA extraction and qRT-PCRTotal-RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Takara, China) and was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, China) by CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, USA). The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in the Table S2.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)The deparaffinized tissue sections at 4 \u00b5m thickness were heated for antigen retrieval at 95 \u00b0C in citric acid buffer (pH 6.0). After treating with 3% H2O2, the sections were blocked with 5% goat normal serum, and incubated with primary antibody against CD31 (1:100, ab9498, Abcam, UK) and FOSL2 (1:800, ab124830, Abcam, UK), separately. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining as described previously. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on preprepared coverslips for 24 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated by 0.1% triton-100, and incubated with 5% goat serum. The specific antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (1:150, ab5694, Abcam, UK), FAP (1:100, #66562, CST, USA) and CD31 (1:80, ab9498, Abcam, UK) were employed in the IF staining. The normal rabbit IgG was the negative control. The nuclei were stained with DAPI and the images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Japan).Luciferase assayCAFs (1\u00d7105 per well) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The cells were transfected with the Wnt5a promoter vectors (pGL3-Wnt5a-WT, pGL3-Wnt5a-truncated, pGL3-Wnt5a-Mut), control vector pGL3 and internal control pRL-TK (Promega, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000. After culture for 30 h, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega, USA), and luciferase activity was measured. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.Western blotting and ELISA assaysCell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The specific primary antibodies used in western blotting analysis were as follows: FOSL2 (1:1000, ab124830, Abcam, UK), Wnt5a (1:1000, ab179824, Abcam, UK), VEGFA (1:1000, ab1316, Abcam, UK); p-VEGFR2 (1:800, D155165, Sangon, China), T-VEGFR2 (1:1000, D151118, Sangon, China); T-AKT (1:1000, #9272, CST, USA), p-AKT (1:1000, #2965, CST, USA), T-ERK (1:1000, #9102, CST, USA), p-ERK (1:1000, #4348, CST, USA), T-P65 (1:1000, #8242, CST, USA), p-P65 (1:1000, #3033, CST, USA) and \u03b2-actin (1:1000, Biosharp, China).For detection of secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of NFs and CAFs, proteins contained in the supernatant were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra15 Centrifugal Filter Device (Merck Millipore, USA). Concentrated supernatants (30 \u03bcL) were used for western blotting analysis. For ELISA, conditioned medium was collected from 1\u00d7106 NFs or CAFs in a 6-well plate, and the concentrations of VEGFA (Raybiotech, USA) and cAMP (R&D System, USA) were determined by a standard ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize the effect of cell number on the concentration of secreted proteins, supernatants from fibroblasts seeded at the same cell density were collected after a short incubation period (24 h), and cell numbers were counted at the CM collection time point. For detection of Wnt5a in patient serum and cellular Wnt5a of tumors, patients' peripheral venous blood was collected before surgery, and the blood and tumor tissue lysate were centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min to collect supernatants. The supernatants from serum and extracts of fresh tumor tissues were used to detect Wnt5a levels using an ELISA kit (Wuhan Purity Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and VEGF-neutralizing antibody treatmentThe stromal fibroblasts (1\u00d7106) were seeded into a 6-well plate in growth medium for 6 h. After removing the growth medium, FBS-free medium (1 mL) was added to further culture the cells for 24 h, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM). To exclude the potential side effects of cell proliferation of CAFs and NFs (e.g., the engineered CAFs and NFs, and their control cells) on CM, cell proliferation, and protein concentration (using Bradford assay kit, Beyotime, China) of CM were carefully determined at the CM collection time point. For neutralization experiments, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF was preincubated at 4 \u00b0C with 1 mL supernatant for 6 h, and the removal of the VEGF effect in the supernatant was proved by ELISA assay. Then, the supernatant was used for HUVEC coculture in tubulogenesis or sprouting experiments. To rule out protein differences in the potential number of cells at the terminal time point of CM harvest, the protein concentration of CM derived from stromal fibroblasts was normalized using the protein concentration deviation value between the test fibroblasts and their control fibroblasts and adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration of control cells to diminish the personal error of cell planting.Invasion assaysStromal fibroblast-mediated HUVEC invasion was evaluated using an 8 \u00b5m pore chamber (Millipore, USA) coated with Matrigel (Corning, USA) as described previously. Cells were allowed to invade toward the medium in the lower chamber, and the invaded HUVECs on the opposite side of the filter were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted after 16 h.Tubule formation and three-dimensional sprouting assaysGrowth factor-reduced Matrigel basement membrane matrix (Corning, USA) was slowly thawed on ice, and 50 \u00b5L of Matrigel was added to each well of a 96-well plate for polymerization. A total of 1\u00d7104 suspended HUVECs were added on top of the Matrigel matrix and treated with the supernatants from CM pretreated with or without VEGF-neutralizing antibody, axitinib, rWnt5a (5 \u00b5g/mL) or BOX5 (a Wnt5a antagonist, 5 \u00b5M) for 24 h. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h, pictures were captured in a 40\u00d7 field and analyzed using ImageJ software. For endothelial cell sprouting assays, HUVECs (1\u00d7103) were cultured with medium containing 0.24% carboxymethylcellulose in nonadherent round-bottom 96-well plates overnight. Spheroids were collected by centrifugation at 400 \u00d7 g and mixed with 2 mg/mL collagen type I (Corning, USA) and FBS-free medium. The three-dimensional fibrin gel was then covered with CM and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 24 h. Endothelial sprouting was analyzed with at least 10 spheroids per group and quantified by recording the branch number under a microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assayChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Magnetic Beads) #9005 (CST, USA). Three primer sets were designed to flank the related putative FOSL2-binding sites in the promoter region of VEGF (Table S3). Briefly, FOSL2-transfected NFs (1.2\u00d7107) were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and sonicated (60 W). Then, the chromatin associated with FOSL2 was pulled down using an anti-FOSL2 antibody or control human IgG. The amounts of the specific DNA fragments were then quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to the genomic DNA prepared from the same cells. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.E2 production assayCells were seeded in six-well plates (2\u00d7106 cells/well) and cultured to 50% confluence. Testosterone was added at 100 nM. The cells were cultured for 48 h, and the medium was harvested for E2 detection using the Access E2 Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter, USA) in the Endocrinology Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.Orthotopic xenograftsThe orthotopic tumor xenograft models were generated as described previously. Animal experiments were approved by the animal care ethics committees at Chongqing Medical University. MDA-MB-231 cells (1\u00d7106) were mixed with an equal number of CAFs/scramble, CAFs/shFOSL2, NFs/vector or NFs/FOSL2 in 200 \u00b5L of PBS:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice (7 mice per group). Tumor size was measured by calipers every 4 days; volume was calculated ((L \u00d7 W2) \u00d7 0.5). When the tumor volume was approximately 50 mm3, a group of mice implanted with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/scramble or CAF/shFOSL2 was separately intraperitoneally administered anti-VEGF antibody (5 mg/kg, twice a week; for 5 consecutive weeks) (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech); a group of mice injected with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/shFOSL2 was treated with rWNT5A (1 ng/1 g body weight, twice weekly, for 5 consecutive weeks); and a group of tumor burden mice with MDA-MB-231 and NF/FOSL2 was injected with BOX5 (0.5 \u00b5g/1 g body weight, once per day, for 5 consecutive weeks). The mice were sacrificed, and xenografts were harvested at 40 days. At the end of animal experiments, tumors were serially sectioned into 4 \u03bcm sections and stained with CD31 for subsequent blinded evaluation of MVD.ResultsHigh FOSL2 expression in breast stromal CAFs is closely associated with tumor angiogenesis and clinical progressStudies investigating the link between CAFs and angiogenesis have been increasingly revealing and demonstrating that the crosstalk between CAFs and endothelial cells facilitates multiple hallmark processes in angiogenesis, where CAFs can even mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. To better understand the characteristics and functions of CAFs associated with tumor angiogenesis, we set out to investigate the transcriptome of breast stromal fibroblasts by microarray analysis using primary CAFs and NFs derived from breast tumor tissues. A set of transcription factors was found to be upregulated in CAFs. Among them, 20 transcription factors were inversely downregulated in preeclampsia (PE) (Figure 1A). The placental phenotype of PE is largely attributed to vascular dysfunction of the placenta, which has been driven by an imbalance of angiogenic signals. PE is concomitant with significantly altered decreased angiogenic factors (VEGF, placental growth factor (PLGF), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)) and increased soluble antiangiogenic factors (e.g., soluble fmslike tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and soluble endoglin (sEng)). As shown in the heatmap of the 20 TFs from the mRNA microarray (Figure 1B), FOSL2, SATB1 and GATA6 in CAFs were identified as candidate transcription factors in the progression of angiogenesis in breast cancer. We isolated 12 pairs of primary CAFs and corresponding NFs from breast cancer and noncancer tissues, and the purities of CAFs were identified by the activated fibroblast biomarkers \u03b1-SMA, FAP and vascular endothelial marker CD31 (a biomarkers of endothelial cells as control) as previously reported (Figure S1A). After analysis of other conventional CAF marker genes (e.g. S100A4, PDGFR\u03b2, PDPN, and CAV1), S100A4 and CAV1 were found to be increased in primary breast CAFs compared with NFs at the mRNA level (Figure S1B). The expression of three candidate transcription factors was then verified in 3 cases of primary mammary fibroblasts from breast reduction surgery and 12 paired primary breast CAFs and NFs by qRT-PCR, and FOSL2 had the most significant and stable expression in primary CAFs (Figure S1C). Subsequently, the high level of FOSL2 protein was almost confirmed in 12 paired primary CAFs by western blotting analysis (Figure 1C). Likewise, the high level of FOSL2 in immortalized CAFs was also detected by qRT-PCR (Figure S1D) and western blotting (Figure 1D), which had a similar expression pattern as in primary CAFs (thus, the immortalized CAFs could be used as a cell model in this study). To further understand the expression of stromal FOSL2 in breast tumor tissues and evaluate the correlation of stromal FOSL2 with the clinical characteristics of breast cancer, FOSL2 proteins were examined in 117 paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Detailed information on stromal FOSL2 expression and the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients are listed in Table S3. The high level of stromal FOSL2 was significantly related to tumor stage (Figure S1E and Figure 1E). In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the expression of stromal FOSL2 was inversely correlated with the overall survival of patients (Figure 1F). Meanwhile, the denser microvessel density (MVD), which was evaluated by CD31 staining, was greater in stromal FOSL2 highly expressed tumor tissues than in stromal FOSL2 low expressed tissues (p<0.001) (Figure 1G-H). The correlation between the levels of FOSL2 mRNA and the microvessel biomarker CD31 was discerned from the analysis of bulk data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the results revealed a positive correlation between FOSL2 mRNA expression and CD31 expression (Figure 1I). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found that the FOSL2-regulated gene signature was positively correlated with the enrichment of angiogenesis-related gene signaling (Figure 1J, and Figure S1F). Collectively, these data indicate that FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts potentially affects angiogenesis in breast tumors.Enhanced FOSL2 in CAFs contributes to breast tumor angiogenesisTo examine the role of FOSL2 in angiogenic behavior, we successfully established endogenous FOSL2 stably knocked down CAFs (CAFs/shFOSL2) and ectopic FOSL2 stably expressed NFs (NFs/FOSL2), which were confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2A-B). Ectopic FOSL2 in NFs or FOSL2 silencing in CAFs led to activation of NFs or inactivation of CAFs, as identified by \u03b1-SMA (Figure S2A). By employing a coculture system including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs or NFs, we observed a significant decrease in the invasion potential of HUVECs and the cumulative number of tubes in the coculture group treated with supernatant derived from FOSL2-silenced CAFs compared with the group treated with supernatant derived from the control CAFs (Figure 2C, top panels; Figure 2D-E). To better mimic in vivo blood vessel formation, we conducted HUVEC spheroid sprouting assays in 3D culture. The results showed that the cumulative sprout length (CSL) was significantly shorter in the system group treated with supernatant from FOSL2-knockdown CAFs than in the control group (Figure 2C, top panels; Figure 2F). In contrast, the invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting abilities of HUVECs were dramatically enhanced by CM from FOSL2-overexpressing NFs (Figure 2C, bottom panels; Figure 2D-F). To adequately understand the pro-angiogenic functions of the CM derived from the engineered CAFs or NFs, we evaluated the different types of vectors on the cell proliferation of CAFs or NFs and the protein concentrations in the medium at the terminal time point of the experiment. The proliferation of CAFs or NFs was not significantly influenced by FOSL2 expression (Figure S2B). The protein concentrations between NFs and CAFs in FBS-free medium or in 10% FBS-containing growth medium also had no significant differences at the terminal time point of CM (Figure S2C-D), indicating that the pro-angiogenic behavior of CM was just induced by FOSL2 levels in CAFs or NFs. Previous studies revealed that FOSL2 was abundantly expressed in breast tumor cells. The effect of CM derived from CAFs or NFs on tumor cells was evaluated. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 breast cancer cells cocultured with CM from FOSL2-silenced CAFs had reduced proliferation (Figure S2E-F) and invasive ability (Figure S2G-I) in comparison with CM from control CAFs. In contrast, the proliferation (Figure S2E-F) and invasion (Figure S2G-I) abilities of breast tumor cells were increased by CM from FOSL2-overexpressing NFs. Taken together, these results suggest that FOSL2 in breast CAFs plays a positive role in angiogenesis.FOSL2 promotes CAF angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent mannerAmong the known angiogenic regulators, VEGFA is a key mediator. We thus evaluated whether FOSL2 can regulate VEGFA expression in breast CAFs. Loss of endogenous FOSL2 in CAFs or transduction of ectopic FOSL2 into NFs had almost no effect on VEGF expression (Figure 3A, and Figure S3A). Consistently, FOSL2 expression was found to be extremely limited in association with VEGFA levels analyzed using TCGA database (Figure S3B, r=0.17, p<0.001). Concomitantly, knockdown of FOSL2 in CAFs or overexpression of ectopic FOSL2 in NFs had no effect on VEGFA secretion in the supernatants derived from these engineered fibroblasts and the corresponding control cells (Figure 3B). Indeed, CM derived from CAFs or ectopic FOSL2-expressing NFs maintained the ability to promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs in the presence of anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 3C-F) or axitinib (an inhibitor of VEGFR) (Figure S3C-F). These data suggest a VEGF-independent proangiogenic function of FOSL2 in CAFs.FOSL2 is regulated by estrogen/cAMP/PKA signalingThe mammary gland is a complex organ that undergoes hormonally regulated changes. CAFs are the major cell type in stroma that converts androgens into estrogen by aromatase, a critical, rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of estrogen in the breast cancer microenvironment. As expected, the mRNA level of aromatase (CYP19A1) (Figure 4A and Figure S4A) and the amount of synthesized estrogen (E2) were notably higher in CAFs than in NFs (Figure 4B). Our previous study found that E2 could efficiently activate downstream signaling through the cAMP/PKA axis in breast stromal fibroblasts. Indeed, more intracellular cAMP production was detected in CAFs or in NFs treated with E2 (Figure 4C). We asked whether FOSL2 expression could be regulated by the estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in CAFs. Astoundingly, the increased FOSL2 levels in immortalized or primary CAFs were notably reduced by SQ22536 (a cAMP inhibitor) (Figure 4D, and Figure S4B) and H89 (a PKA inhibitor) (Figure 4E, and Figure S4C); conversely, a higher level of FOSL2 was detected in immortalized or primary NFs stimulated by E2 (Figure 4F, and Figure S4D). Furthermore, efficient knockdown of CYP19A1 in CAFs (Figure 4G) led to decreased FOSL2 (Figure 4H-I). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the local estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in breast CAFs is involved in regulating FOSL2 expression.FOSL2 transcriptionally activates Wnt5a and leads to increased Wnt5a secretion from CAFsTo further explore the functions of stromal FOSL2 in regulating angiogenesis, we identified target genes of FOSL2 by merging the data acquired from targets predicted by the Cistrome database (http://cistrome.org/db/) with the potential genes associated with angiogenesis and secretion of extracellular proteins from the AmiGO database (http://amigo.geneontology.org/). Sixty-eight candidates that may be regulated by FOSL2 and related to angiogenesis were identified (Figure 5A). After comparison with our mRNA expression profile of CAFs/NFs, 14 candidate genes were aberrantly expressed in breast CAFs (Figure 5B). Using a protein network analysis, we found that Wnt5a was in the core of the network among these potential transcriptional targets of FOSL2, indicating that Wnt5a is a major candidate target of FOSL2 (Figure S5A). In accordance with this finding and our previous RNA-sequencing data of CAFs/NFs, Wnt5a was markedly upregulated in breast tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumor tissues using a public database including 1085 cases of tumors and 291 cases of normal tissues (Figure S5B), suggesting increased Wnt5a in the tumor stroma. Further analysis proved that Wnt5a was significantly changed at the mRNA and protein levels in FOSL2-knockdown CAFs or FOSL2-overexpressing NFs (Figure 5C-D). To further understand whether Wnt5a is a direct transcriptional target of FOSL2, a bioinformatics analysis and sets of experiments were carried out. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there were three potential FOSL2 binding consensus sequences (E1, E2 and E3) in the Wnt5a promoter (Figure 5E). Checked by luciferase reporter assay, we found that the reporter containing E2 (Figure 5E) had high transcriptional activity (Figure 5F, upper panel), and mutation of the E2 motif (Figure 5E) notably decreased luciferase activity (Figure 5F, down panel), which was further confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 5G), suggesting that consensus E2 is essential for FOSL2-mediated transcriptional activity of Wnt5a. Consistently, more Wnt5a-secreting CAFs were detected than NFs, and the concentration of Wnt5a secreted in the supernatant was significantly reduced in FOSL2-knockdown CAFs compared with that in control CAFs. Conversely, there was increased Wnt5a secretion in FOSL2-overexpressing NFs compared with that in control NFs (Figure 5H). These data demonstrate that FOSL2 can directly regulate Wnt5a expression.Wnt5a plays an essential role in the FOSL2-mediated promotion of angiogenesis in CAFsTo investigate the pro-angiogenic role of Wnt5a in breast CAFs, we transfected a retrovirus-mediated shRNA specifically against Wnt5a in CAFs and an ectopic Wnt5a construct into NFs. Wnt5a overexpression in NFs (NF/Wnt5a) or loss of endogenous Wnt5a in CAFs (CAFs/shWnt5a) resulted in marked changes in the invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting abilities of HUVECs (Figure S5C), indicating that Wnt5a, as a downstream target of FOSL2, is essential for CAF-promoting angiogenesis function. Next, we examined the Wnt5a-dependent angiogenesis role of FOSL2 in CAFs. Treatment of HUVECs with supernatant derived from FOSL2-silenced CAFs reduced the cell invasion (Figure 6A, upper panels; Figure 6B, left panel), tube formation (Figure 6C, upper panels; Figure 6D, left panel) and spheroid sprouting (Figure 6E, upper panels; Figure 6F, left panel) potential of HUVECs. The addition of rWnt5a into the supernatant from FOSL2-silenced CAFs rescued the cell invasion, tube formation and spheroid sprouting potential of HUVECs, which resulted from the loss of FOSL2 in CAFs (Figure 6A-F). In contrast, the promoting effects on cell invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting of HUVECs were observed in CM derived from ectopic FOSL2 NFs and mitigated by treatment of the CM with BOX5, a Wnt5a antagonist (Figure 6A, 6C and 6E, down panels; Figure 6B, 6D and 6F, right panels). Thus, this evidence supports the Wnt5a-dependent angiogenesis role of stromal FOSL2 in breast cancer.Wnt5a derived from CAFs activates FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling in endothelial cellsWnt5a can induce signal transduction in target cells by binding to its receptors, the Frizzled family (FZDs), a cysteine-rich seven transmembrane receptor family. We asked whether CAF-derived Wnt5a could bind to FZD5, a potential member of the Frizzled family in HUVECs, and stimulate possible downstream signaling pathways. Efficient knockdown of FZD5 in HUVECs (Figure 7A) abolished the cell invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs even in the presence of rWnt5a (Figure 7B-D), suggesting that FZD5 is necessary for Wnt5a in angiogenesis. Several signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, ERK and AKT, are potential downstream signaling pathways of FZDs; thus, the activation of NF-\u03baB, ERK and AKT signaling in HUVECs was examined. As shown in Figure 7E, loss of FOSL2 or Wnt5a in CAFs significantly quenched the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK in HUVECs stimulated by CAF CM. Similarly, loss of FZD5 in HUVECs rendered NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling unable to respond to CAF CM, and addition of rWnt5a in FBS-free medium directly activated these signaling pathways in HUVECs (Figure 7E-F). However, the activation of VEGFR2 was not affected by silencing FOSL2, Wnt5a, or FZD5 or by exogenous supplementation with rWnt5a. Meanwhile, Wnt5a, as a representative member of the noncanonical Wnt proteins, has been reported to play dual roles in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. We found that Wnt5a could stimulate the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in HUVECs (Figure 7F) and thereby promote angiogenesis. These data demonstrate that the Wnt5a/FZD5 axis stimulates the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling in HUVECs.CAFs promote breast tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner to fuel breast tumor growth in vivoTo further investigate the proangiogenesis function of the FOSL2/Wnt5a signaling axis in vivo, a mixture of the indicated cells was subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Compared with the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with FOSL2-silenced CAFs had fewer blood vessels on the tumor surface and less CD31 staining in tumor tissue; the tumor burden mice injected with a mixture of MDA-MB-231 and FOSL2-overexpressing NFs had more blood vessels and a large tumor size (Figure 8A and Figure S6A). To confirm the number differences of blood vessels attributing to angiogenesis, the mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (CDH5), a strictly endothelial marker, and prosperohomeobox protein1 (prox1), a biomarker for lymphatic endothelial cells were detected in the tumor samples (Figure S6B). The high level of VE-cadherin closely related with microvessel density based on CD31 staining rather than prox1 expression. In contrast to blockage of VEGF signaling alone by anti-VEGF antibody, FOSL2 knockdown in CAFs combined with VEGF signaling inhibitors could augment the suppressive efficiencies to tumor angiogenesis, indicating that FOSL2 acted as an obviously proangiogenic effector in the VEGF-independent pathway. Consistently, treating mice with Wnt5a, the critical pro-angiogenic factor regulated by FOSL2, could partly rescue blood vessels and tumor growth of tumor burden mice injected with FOSL2-silenced CAFs (labeled CAF/shFOSL2 + rWnt5a) in comparison to their control tumors (labeled CAF/shFOSL2). The tumor burden mice injected with NFs had fewer blood vessels and small tumors, and ectopic FOSL2 in NFs could significantly promote blood vessels and tumor growth. However, treatment of tumor burden mice injected with FOSL2-overexpressing NFs using BOX5 (Wnt5a antagonist) mitigated FOSL2-stimulated blood vessels and tumor growth (Figure 8B-C and Figure S6C). In addition, we found that knockdown of FOSL2 in CAFs could increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to VEGF inhibitors in vivo (Figure 8A-C, Figure S6A-C). Similarly, loss of Wnt5a, the direct target of FOSL2, in CAFs significantly decreased tumor blood vessel formation and tumor growth (Figure S6D-F). To further evaluate the clinical value of FOSL2-regulated Wnt5a involved in angiogenesis, we detected secreted Wnt5a levels in serum from 71 breast cancer patients and Wnt5a levels in corresponding tumor tissues or secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of primary stromal fibroblasts isolated from 12 pairs of nontumor and tumor samples and the corresponding FOSL2 expression and vessel density of tumors. High levels of secreted Wnt5a were detected in patient serum, and enhanced serum Wnt5a was positively correlated with microvessel density in breast tumors (Figure 8D). The FOSL2 protein levels in tumor tissues were closely related to the Wnt5a concentration in tumor extracts (Figure 8E). Moreover, the FOSL2 levels in primary stromal CAFs were much higher than those in the corresponding primary NFs, and the enhanced stromal FOSL2 was almost correlated with a high concentration of secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of CAFs (Figure 8F and S6G), confirming that FOSL2-regulated Wnt5a in stromal CAFs was close to clinical angiogenesis. Collectively, the current study reveals a novel function of breast CAFs. The increased FOSL2 in CAFs plays a pivotal role in promoting angiogenesis by regulating Wnt5a, thus stimulating activation of the downstream FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling axis in vascular endothelial cells to fuel tumor angiogenesis VEGF-independent patterns.DiscussionThe identification of angiogenesis as a prerequisite for the outgrowth of solid tumors boosts the field of angiogenesis research. However, enthusiasm for angiostatic therapy has been hampered due to the limited beneficial effect of these anti-angiogenesis agents on patient survival, especially in breast cancers. The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been considered to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. In particular, CAFs are gradually viewed as the chief architects of the TME due to their multiple functions, including tumor angiogenesis with intimate crosstalk between endothelial cells. In this study, we identified that the transcriptional factor FOSL2 may act as a novel tumor angiogenesis target in breast CAFs. The enhanced FOSL2 in breast CAFs was induced by endogenous aromatase through the E2/cAMP/PKA pathway. Furthermore, the activated CAFs induced by FOSL2 could not promote VEGF but could promote Wnt5a expression, which stimulated angiogenesis through FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling, even under the blockage of classical VEGF signaling by anti-VEGF antibody and axitinib. Collectively, the current study suggests that targeting FOSL2 in stromal CAFs may be an effective alternative to overcome tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF signaling treatment.Transcription factors (TFs) coordinate the expression of target genes typically through cis-regulatory DNA elements. A small set of lineage-specific master TFs dictate the core transcriptional programs governing cell identity and malignant state. Elucidating the core transcriptional regulatory mechanisms is necessary to understand the fundamentals of molecular carcinogenesis. A more recent study has revealed that stomach and intestinal lineage-specific programs are reactivated in Sox2high/Sox9high and Cdx2high cancers by comparing the gastrointestinal lineage-specific transcriptome to human gastrointestinal cancer data, which highlights the importance of developmental lineage programs reactivated by gastrointestinal TFs in cancer. Strikingly, a novel study has determined that TFs of the FOS family are significantly variable for single E18 fetal mouse mammary cells when compared with the permutated background, suggesting that these factors may contribute to cellular differentiation programs. Herein, we found that FOSL2 was upregulated in activated CAFs of breast cancers. The links between FOSL2-mediated breast development and breast tumor angiogenesis suggest that targeting FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts may have significant value for breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, we found that FOSL2 was downregulated in preeclampsia (PE) by analyzing the transcriptome of PE, which was ascribed to decreased angiogenesis signaling. These works support our findings that FOSL2 in breast CAFs plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.The role of CAFs in tumor angiogenesis architecture is increasingly dominant in breast tissues. The focus of our study on breast CAFs in angiogenesis is promising. Recently, in an MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer, the issue of heterogeneity of CAFs was distinguished by the global gene expression profile using single-cell RNA sequencing. Of note, there are three subtypes of mouse CAFs, including vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs), that are significantly enriched by gene ontology (GO) sets. The vCAF signatures, close to vascular development and angiogenesis, are highly conserved in patient samples of breast tumors. Therefore, antagonizing CAFs as an antiangiogenic treatment modality for breast cancer opens the possibility for biomarker-driven development of drugs for precision therapy.Stromal CAF populations, which engage in pleiotropic processes in tumor angiogenesis, are pivotal to the resistance of VEGF blockade. It has been shown that resistance to antiangiotherapy is partly involved in angio-stimulatory growth factor redundancy and multiplicity. In a seminal paper, compression-induced expression of glycolysis genes in CAFs correlates with angiogenesis gene expression in breast cancer. Tumor-induced compression might inevitably be a sustained driver for angiogenesis-related gene expression to cause the redundancy of angiogenesis growth factors. Meanwhile, tumor angiogenesis can become VEGF independent at a more advanced stage because of the production of other proangiogenesis molecules and thus respond poorly to VEGF blockade. The release of multiple angiogenesis factors, such as SDF-1 and PDGF-C, by CAFs contributes to resistance. Our studies support that, likewise, although VEGFA is considerably expressed in breast CAFs, FOSL2 is one of the key players in promoting angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner. FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts promotes angiogenesis by inducing Wnt5a transcription.Aberrant Wnt5a signaling is an important event in tumor progression, with oncogenic or tumor-suppressing effects dependent on tumor types. In breast cancer, the respectable evidence supports that Wnt5a has oncogenic activity. For example, elevated Wnt5a was detected in basal-like breast cancer cells at both the mRNA and protein levels, and loss of Wnt5a could efficiently inhibit tumor growth in SUM1315 cells in vivo . In addition, GLIS1, a novel hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, was reported to increase the migration and invasion capacities of breast cancer cells by upregulating Wnt5a, and Wnt5a levels were associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Notably, several studies reported that Wnt5a was highly expressed in breast stromal cells and associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. For example, enhanced Wnt5a was proven in breast tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which induced invasiveness of breast cancer cells and production of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in macrophages. A whole-transcriptome analysis of selectively retrieved engulfing breast cancer cells identified a gene signature of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) engulfment consisting of Wnt5a, which enhanced distant metastasis. Another study revealed that Wnt5a in breast CAFs was significantly downregulated after 1,25D (1alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) treatment, in which 1,25D elicited obvious tumor suppressive effects. In addition, the role of Wnt5a is emerging in the promotion of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, Wnt5a signaling has been found to be required for the pathological angiogenesis. In a study, the reduced vascularization of matrigel plugs in conditional deletion of the Wnt secretion factor Evi in mouse ECs (Evi-ECKO) could be rescued by introduction of non-canonical Wnt5a. The release of Wnt5a from infiltrating monocytes is especially important to drive angiogenesis in inflamed vessels. In addition, Wnt5a has been disclosed to play essential role in tumor angiogenesis, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. However, whether Wnt5a derived from stromal cell acting a role in angiogenesis has poor understanding. In one research, CD163 positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) may induce angiogenesis via crosstalk with malignant epithelial cells to promote Wnt5a expression. Here, we confirmed that the increased stromal Wnt5a plays a crucial role in VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast cancer. Our findings provide important evidence for its oncogenic role in the breast tumor microenvironment, which suggests that targeting Wnt5a in the breast TME may provide a potential option for antiangiogenesis therapy in breast cancer.Together, our study supports the notion that stromal CAFs promote VEGF-independent pro-angiogenesis processes in breast cancer, and FOSL2-mediated Wnt5a expression and activation of downstream signaling are crucial for VEGF-independent angiogenesis of breast CAFs. The elucidation of reciprocal interactions of breast CAFs with endothelial cells may inspire the development of conceptually novel targeted therapeutics with the aim of thwarting the FOSL2/Wnt5a axis of breast tumor angiogenesis.Supplementary MaterialTumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implicationsVEGF in Signaling and Disease: Beyond Discovery and DevelopmentResistance and escape from

IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in the coevolution of breast tumor cells and their microenvironment by modifying cellular compartments and regulating cancer cell functions via stromal-epithelial dialogue. However, the relationship and interaction between stromal and epithelial cells is still poorly understood. Herein, we revealed that breast cancer cells have a stronger ability to activate fibroblasts and transform them into myofibroblasts (CAF-like) than normal breast epithelial cells, and this stronger ability occurs through paracrine signaling. In turn, myofibroblasts promote the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness of breast cancer cells. Detailed regulatory mechanisms showed that, compared with normal cells, Survivin is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, which are then internalized by fibroblasts. Breast cancer cell-derived survivin up-regulates SOD1 expression in fibroblasts and then converts them into myofibroblasts, conversely inducing breast cancer progression <iin vitro</i and <iin vivo</i Thus, our results indicate that survivin acts as an activator of the tumor microenvironment and that SOD1 up-regulation in fibroblasts can promote breast cancer progression. These results suggest that targeting survivin and SOD1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.",

Morphologies and sizes of exosomes were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and particle size analysis respectively. BC mouse models were injected with DIR labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 or Exo-M1. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells was determined by PCR and Western blot. PKH67 labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 were incubated with NFs or MCF-7 to measure the activation of CAFs. Cell invasion and migration abilities were determined by scratch test and Transwell assay. Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1 were successfully extracted with positive expressions of Alix, CD63 and TSG101. Contents of Ki67, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail-1 were increased but E-cadherin was decreased, compared to Exo-MA group. Exo-M7 or Exo-M1 could increase BC cell proliferation and enhance EMT in nude mouse. Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 could accelerate the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote the recruitment of CAFs in MCF-7. Transfection of miR-146a could promote the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote cell invasion and migration of MCF-7\u00a0cells. As a target gene of miR-146a, TXNIP could inhibit the activation of CAFs. miR-146a overexpression or TXNIP silence enhance the activation of Wnt signal pathway.

IntroductionBreast cancers (BC) represent the most common female cancers worldwide and cause the greatest number of cancer-related deaths among women. New treatments are necessary to improve BC patient outcome and survival. Exceptional advances have been achieved in cancer therapy with immune checkpoints inhibitors. Immune checkpoints inhibitors represent a current therapy for some solid neoplasia, such as melanoma and lung cancer. Several clinical trials are currently on going to test Immunotherapies in BC patients. Nevertheless, only a subgroup of patients treated with these drugs shows a beneficial response, suggesting the existence of primary resistance mechanisms that favor escape from immune response. In this context, identification of new immunosuppressive mechanisms mediated by tumor cells or by cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) might be extremely significant. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are one of the most abundant TME components in solid tumors. CAF are involved in multiple tumor-promoting activities, including tumor growth, metastatic spread, angiogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy. The understanding of CAF heterogeneity in human cancer recently evolved. Indeed, recent studies identified different CAF subsets in several cancer types. In breast and ovarian cancer, four distinct CAF subsets (named CAF-S1 to CAF-S4) have been recently identified by combining different fibroblastic markers, including fibroblast activation protein (FAP), Integrin \u03b21 (CD29), smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (\u03b1-SMA) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR\u03b2). CAF-S1 (FAP+ CD29med-high \u03b1-SMAmed-high PDGFR\u03b2med-high) and CAF-S4 (FAP- CD29high \u03b1-SMAhigh PDGFR\u03b2low-med) myofibroblastic subsets accumulate in aggressive BC subtypes, i.e., HER2 and triple-negative (TN) BC. In line with these findings, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 drive metastasis formation in axillary lymph nodes and late distant relapse in BC patients through complementary mechanisms. Moreover, CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote immunosuppression by interacting with regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in BC and ovarian tumors, thereby confirming previous observations in pancreatic cancer and in mouse models. In particular, CAF-S1 increase the proportion of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T lymphocytes, enriched in Tregs, by promoting their attraction, survival and activation. These data demonstrate that FAP+ fibroblasts (CAF-S1) could act as a source of resistance to anti-tumor immune response not only in mice but also in humans, as recently demonstrated. The mechanisms underlying CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppression and the way to target clinically these cells in order to circumvent their immunosuppressive activity remain open biological and medical questions.The ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase CD73 (also referred as NT5E) is well-known to promote tumor immune escape through production of extracellular adenosine. CD73 converts extracellular AMP into extracellular adenosine (Ado) and works in tandem with CD39 (also named ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1, ENTPD1), responsible for the degradation of extracellular ATP and ADP into AMP. In physiological conditions, Ado produced by CD73 enzymatic activity protects tissues against excessive inflammation. Indeed, Ado binds to purinergic adenosine receptors (A2A and A2B) at the surface of lymphoid and myeloid cells, preventing their proliferation and effector functions. CD73 is overexpressed in a wide range of human carcinomas, such as TN BC, and its expression is linked to poor prognosis. As a rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of immunosuppressive Ado, CD73 represents an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. Interestingly, CD73 is highly expressed in FAP+ (CAF-S1) fibroblasts in breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer. While CD73 expression and roles have been well established in cancer cells and in tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes, CD73 functions in CAF remain poorly investigated. Here, we address this question and show that high CD73 protein level, observed in CAF-S1-enriched BC patients, is associated with Tregs accumulation. In contrast, CD73 expression in cancer cells is not indicative of Tregs infiltration in BC, indicating that stromal CD73 is key in immunosuppression. In human primary CAF-S1 cell lines isolated from BC, we confirmed that CD73 is highly expressed and enzymatically active. Moreover, by performing functional in vitro assays using primary cells, we demonstrated that CAF-S1 fibroblasts increase the abundance of PD-1+, CTLA-4+ and PD-1+ CTLA-4+ double positive T cells among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ Tregs. Interestingly, blockade of CAF-S1-dependent CD73 enzymatic activity by using a specific anti-CD73 antibody impairs CAF-S1-mediated Tregs activation and immunosuppressive function, suggesting that BC patients might benefit from anti-CD73 immunotherapy. Taken as a whole, our data reinforce the potential clinical interest of using anti-CD73 antibody in clinical practice.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Description of Retrospective and Prospective Cohorts of Breast Cancer PatientsThe projects developed here are based on surgical residues, available after histopathological analyses and not required for diagnosis. There is no interference with clinical practice. Samples from all patients included in this study were analyzed before patients received any treatment. Analysis of tumor samples was performed according to the relevant national law on the protection of people taking part in biomedical research. All patients included in our study were female (see #Institutional Review Board Statement and #Informed consent statement). HER2-amplified carcinomas have been defined according to ERBB2 immunostaining using ASCO\u2019s guideline. Luminal (Lum) tumors were defined by positive immunostaining for ER (estrogen receptor) and/or PR (progesterone receptor). The cut-off used to define hormone receptor positivity was 10% of stained cells. LumA patients were defined according to Ki67 (proliferation) staining (Ki67 below 15%: LumA). TN immunophenotype was defined as follows: ER-PR-ERBB2- with the expression of at least one of the following markers: KRT5/6+, EGF-R+, Kit+.Retrospective cohort: The retrospective cohort was composed by n = 215 BC patients including LumA (n = 96), HER2 (n = 54) and TN (n = 65) and was analyzed by IHC. For this retrospective cohort, we had access to Tissue Micro-Arrays composed by 2 cores of BC surgical samples selected by Pathologist as representative for the whole tumor (diameters: 1 mm; thickness: 3 \u00b5m). The clinical features of BC patients are described in Table 1. To determine the CAF-subset enrichment in BC patients of each subtype, the staining of 6 different fibroblastic markers (FAP, CD29, \u03b1-SMA, PDDGFR\u03b2, FSP-1, CAV) has been performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in LumA, HER2, and TN BC subtypes and the histological scores (Hscores) quantified, as described in. The infiltration of CD3+ and FOXP3+ T cells has been quantified manually in the epithelial and stromal compartments, separately, considering 5 to 10 representative fields at 20\u00d7 magnification per tumor and divided by the area of the section.Prospective cohort: The prospective cohort was composed by n = 26 fresh BC samples prior treatment after the surgery and includes LumA (n = 12), HER2 (n = 3) and TN (n = 11) subtypes. Samples were collected and cultured in vitro to establish CAF primary cell lines (see below). The clinical features of prospective cohort are described in Table 1.2.2. CD73 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Staining in BC SamplesCD73 IHC staining in human BC samples was performed using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. CD73 IHC staining was performed in the Lab Vision IHC Autostrainer 480 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For the deparafination of FFPE samples, the standard protocol with xylene and alcohol gradient was used. After dewaxing procedure, FFPE samples were incubated in a solution citrate pH6 (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA, #S236984-2) in the microwave for 20 min at 97 \u00b0C for antigen retrieval. The blockade of endogenous peroxidase was made with Dako REAL peroxidase-blocking solution (Dako, #S202386-2) for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Blocking of unspecific binding was performed using a Dako blocking serum-free solution ready-to-use (Dako, #X0909) for 10 min at RT. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-human CD73 primary antibody (Sigma, Saint-Louis, MO, USA, #HPA017357, dilution 1:600) previously tested for its specificity or Rabbit IgG, polyclonal isotype control (abcam, #ab171870, dilution 1:1250) for 1 h at RT. The antibodies were diluted in Dako EnVision FLEX Wash Buffer (Dako, #K800721-2). After antigen detection, sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit (ABC kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, #PK-6101) for 25 min at RT. The tissue sections were washed using Dako EnVision FLEX Wash Buffer (Dako, #K800721-2). Antibody detection was performed by incubation with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA, #PK-6101) for 25 min at RT and detected with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine for 5 min at RT (Dako, #K3468). Counterstaining was performed with Mayer hematoxylin freshly prepared (Dako, #S3309). Tissue sections were then submitted to serial gradients of xylen prior and mounted with coverslip in an automatic device (Sakura, Flemingweg, The Netherlands, Tissue-Tek DRS).2.3. Quantification of CD73 Histological Scores (HScores) in Epithelial and Stromal Compartments of BC SamplesIn order to quantify the CD73 IHC staining in sections, the slides were scanned using Philips Ultra-Fast Scanner and visualized at high resolution in the Philips IMS 2.2 software for further analysis and photos. The CD73 staining was quantified as histological score (Hscore), calculated as percentage of stained cells (either cancer cells or fibroblasts) multiplied by the intensity of staining in epithelium and stromal compartments, separately. For each section, the percentages of stroma and epithelial compartments were based on morphology assessment. We referred as Epithelium the compartment composed by cancer cells which have round shape, large nucleus and low cytoplasm content. We considered Stroma the compartment composed by fibroblasts which have an elongated shape, tiny and elongated nucleus and scarce cytoplasm. The discrimination between the two compartments was verified by EPCAM (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule) and \u03b1-SMA staining performed by independent researcher for the previous studies.2.4. Establishment of CAF-S1 Primary Cell Lines from BC SamplesTo establish CAF-S1 primary cell lines for this study, we based on protocols described in previous studies. In brief, BC samples were cut into small fragments (about 1 mm2) in sterile conditions and put in a previously grid-designed petri dish, in presence of DMEM (Hyclone, Cytiva, Logan, UT, USA, #SH30243.01) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biosera Europe, Nuaille, France, #FB-1003/500) with streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) (Gibco, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, #15140122) (Supplemented DMEM). Tumor fragments were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 1.5% O2 for at least 2 weeks. Primary CAF spread from small tumor fragments, adhered to plate and proliferated. When CAF reached 60\u201370% confluence, they were harvested with TrypLE (Gibco, #12605-10), washed and centrifuged (1200 rpm, 5 min) and put in a new petri dish with supplemented DMEM. CAF-S1 phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry, as described below. CAF-S1 were used until passage 10 to avoid senescence, commonly occurring with primary cell lines.2.5. Characterization of CAF-S1 by Flow Cytometry AnalysisCAF-S1 phenotype was assessed by flow cytometry. CAF-S1 primary cell lines were used when they reached at least 90% confluence. CAF were harvested and suspended in PBS supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated human serum and 2 mM EDTA (PBS+) at 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 50 \u00b5L and were moved in 96 well-plate V-bottom (Greiner, Kremsm\u00fcnster, Austria, #651101) for the staining. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD\u2122 fixable dye (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, #L34957) (dilution 1:1000 in PBS) for 20 min at RT. After one washing with PBS and one centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 min, CAF were fixed with 4% PFA solution (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Philadelphia, PA, USA, #15710) for 20 min at RT. After one washing with PBS+, cells were stained with antibody or isotype control mixes for 45 min at RT. Antibodies and isotypes control were diluted in PBS+ supplemented with 0.1% saponin. The antibody mix contains anti-FAP-APC (primary antibody, 1:200, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, #MAB3715), anti-CD29-Alexa Fluor 700 (1:100, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA, #303020) anti-PDGFR\u03b2-BV421 (1:50, BD Horizon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA, #564124) anti-SMA-Alexa\u00ae Fluor 594 (1:25, R&D Systems, #IC1420T-025) antibodies. The isotype control mix contains purified mouse IgG1 isotype control (primary antibody, 1:200, R&D Systems, #MAB002), Alexa Fluor 700 mouse IgG1 isotype control (1:100, BioLegend, #400144), BV421 mouse IgG2A isotype control (1:100, BD Horizon, #562439) and Alexa\u00ae Fluor 594 mouse IgG2A isotype control (1:25, R&D Systems, #IC003T). At the end of staining, cells were rapidly washed and suspended in PBS+. Stained CAF-S1 fibroblasts were analyzed using LSRFortessaTM analyzer (BD biosciences). At least 5 \u00d7 105 events were recorded. Compensations were performed using single staining on anti-mouse IgG and negative control beads (BD biosciences, #552843) for each antibody and ArC reactive beads (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR, USA, #A10346) for live/dead staining. Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.5.2.2.6. Measurement of CD73 Protein Levels in CAF-S1 by Flow CytometryCD73 protein levels at the surface of CAF-S1 primary cells were assessed by flow cytometry. CAF-S1 were stained with unconjugated anti-CD73 Ab (Innate Pharma, Marseille, France) or the corresponding isotype control (Innate Pharma) for 20 min at RT protected from light. Antibody cloning, chimerization and purification were described in detail in a previous study. After two serial washing with PBS+, CAF-S1 fibroblasts were stained with secondary antibody conjugated with PE fluorescent dye (1:200, Jackson Immuno research, West Baltimore Pike, Philadelphia, PA, USA, #109-116-160) for 20 min at RT. At the end of staining, cells were rapidly washed as in previous steps and were suspended in PBS+ for the analysis by flow cytometry. 2.5 \u00b5g/mL of DAPI were added just before the analysis. CD73 staining at the surface of CAF-S1 was analyzed using LSRFortessaTM analyzer (BD biosciences). At least 5 \u00d7 105 events were recorded. Data were examined using FlowJo 10.5.2. Alive and single cells were examined for CD73 protein level. The specific Median Fluorescence Intensity (SpeMFI) for CD73 was calculated as follow: MFI of CAF-S1 stained with anti-CD73 Ab/MFI of CAF-S1 stained with isotype control.2.7. Measurement of Exogenous AMP HydrolysisCD73 enzymatic activity in CAF-S1 primary cell lines was assessed using AMP GLOTM luminescence assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, #V5011) allowing the measurement of exogenous AMP hydrolysis. Harvested CAF-S1 were suspended in supplemented DMEM at the concentration of 4 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. A total of 25 \u00b5L of CAF-S1 was plated in 96 well-plate U-bottom (Falcon, Corning, NY, USA, #353077) alone, in presence of anti-CD73 or isotype control antibody at 10 \u00b5g/mL, or the pharmacological inhibitor, APCP, at 100 \u00b5M. Cells were incubated 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. A total of 25 \u00b5L of AMP 50 \u00b5M diluted in supplemented DMEM was added for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. After a rapid centrifuge, 25 \u00b5L of supernatants were then moved in 96-well white microplate (Grainer, #655083) to quantify the residual AMP with AMP-GloTM luminescence assay according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Emitted light was measured on plate reader (Fluorstar Optima, BMG Labtech). The relative luminescence units (RLU) were proportional to the residual AMP within supernatants. The percentages of residual AMP were calculated as follow: %residual AMP = relative luminescence unit (CAF-S1 untreated or treated with anti-CD73, isotype CTL antibody or APCP)/relative luminescence unit (AMP alone) \u00d7 100. %degraded AMP = 100 \u2212 %residual AMP.2.8. Isolation of Peripheral Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from Healthy DonorsPBMC were isolated from blood of healthy donors (HD) obtained from the \u2018Etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang (Paris, France). PBMC were isolated using density gradient centrifugation in presence of Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada #07861) previously cooled at 4 \u00b0C. PBMC were diluted in RPMI (Hyclone, #SH30027.01) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS with streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) (supplemented RPMI) at the concentration of 108 cells/mL. Cell were stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight, before the isolation of CD4+ CD25+ T cells.2.9. Isolation of CD4+ CD25+ T Cells from Healthy Donor PBMCsA total of 5\u20137.5 \u00d7 108 PBMC was used for CD4+ CD25+ T cells purification by Human CD4+ CD25+ Tregs Isolation kit (MiltenyiBiotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. #130-091-301) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The purity of CD4+ CD25+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry. CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes were suspended in supplemented DMEM at 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 50 \u00b5L for co-culture with CAF-S1.2.10. Co-Culture of CAF-S1 with CD4+ CD25+ T Cells after anti-CD73 Antibody TreatmentTo study the impact of CD73 blockade on the immunosuppressive function of primary CAF-S1, CAF-S1 were plated in 24-well plates at the concentration of 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 50 \u00b5L. Cells were plated in supplemented DMEM containing the anti-CD73 antibody or the corresponding isotype control (Innate Pharma) at 10 \u00b5g/mL. CAF-S1 were incubated 24 h at 37 \u00b0C at 1.5% O2. The media were replaced by fresh supplemented DMEM just before addition of 5 \u00d7 105 CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes to CAF-S1 alone or pre-treated with anti-CD73 or with isotype control. Co-cultures were incubated for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C, 20% O2. After incubation, T lymphocytes were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. T cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD\u2122 fixable dye (Invitrogen #L34968) for 20 min at RT. After washing with PBS+, T cells were suspended in 50 \u00b5L of antibody or isotype control mixes in PBS+ for 15 min at RT. The antibody mix was composed by anti-CD45-APC-Cy7 (1:20, BD Pharmigen, #557833), anti-CD3Alexa Fluor 700 (1:20, BD Biosciences, #557943), anti-CD4-BV650 (1:50, Biolegend 317436) anti-CD25-PE (1:20, Miltenyi Biotec, # 130-113-282), anti-PD-1-BV421 (1:20, BD Horizon, #562516) anti-CTLA-4-PE-Cy5 (1:10, BD Pharmigen, #555854), anti-CD39-PerCP-efluor 710 (1:100, Invitrogen, #46-0399-42) and anti-CD73-APC Ab (Innate Pharma). The isotype control mix was composed by the same anti-CD45-APC-Cy7 (1:20, BD Pharmigen, #557833), anti-CD3Alexa Fluor 700 (1:20, BD Biosciences, #557943), anti-CD4-BV650 (1:50, Biolegend 317436) Ab and PE mouse IgG2b isotype control (1:20, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-215), BV421 mouse IgG1 isotype control (1:20, BD Horizon, #562438), PE-Cy5 mouse IgG2a isotype control (1:10, BD Pharmigen, #555575), PerCP-e710 mouse IgG1 isotype (1:100, Invitrogen, #46-4714-82) and APC mouse IgG1 isotype control (1:80, Invitrogen, #17-4714-82). T cells were washed with PBS+ and centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. FOXP3 staining buffer set kit (eBioscience, #00-5523-00) was used to detect intra-nuclear FOXP3 protein. After fixation and permeabilization for 1 h at RT, T lymphocytes were incubated with anti-FOXP3-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:40, Thermofisher Scientific, #53-4776) or the corresponding isotype control (1:200, Thermofisher scientific, #53-4321-80) for 30 min at RT. Stained T cells were analyzed by LSRFortessaTM analyzer (BD biosciences). At least 105 events were recorded. Data were examined using FlowJo 10.5.2.2.11. Treg Cell Suppressive AssayThis protocol was adapted from. After CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes isolation, CD4+ CD25- T cells were kept overnight at 4 \u00b0C in TexMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-097-196). CD4+ CD25+ T cells were stained with antibody mix for 15 min at RT. The antibody mix was diluted in PBS+ in presence of a pool of fluorescent-conjugated primary antibodies recognizing CD4-APC (1:20, Miltenyi Biotec, #130-113-210), CD25-PE-Cy7 (1:40, BD Pharmingen\u2122, #557741) CD127-FITC (1:20, ThermoFisher Scientific, #11-1278-42), and CD45RA-PE (1:20, BD Pharmingen\u2122, #555489) proteins. Alive CD4+ CD25med CD127- CD45RAlow cells (regulatory T cells, Tregs) were sorted on MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter). Tregs were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min and suspended in supplemented DMEM at the following concentration 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 50 \u00b5L.5 \u00d7 104 CAF-S1 fibroblasts were cultivated 24 h before the sorting of Tregs at 37 \u00b0C, 1.5% O2 in 24 well-plate. Cells were suspended in medium containing or not anti-CD73 or anti-CD73 isotype control antibodies at 10 \u00b5g/mL. Media were replaced with 450 \u00b5L of supplemented DMEM just before Tregs were added. Tregs were co-cultured with CAF-S1 fibroblasts for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C, 20% O2 in 24-well plate. Upon 16 h of co-culture, Treg cells were recovered in 1.5 mL tubes and manually counted using Glasstic slides with 10 grids (Kova, #87144E). Tregs were resuspended in supplemented RPMI at 2 \u00d7 104 cells in 50 \u00b5L.Previously isolated CD4+ CD25- cells (Teff) were stained 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% O2 with 5 \u00b5M CellTrace\u2122 CFSE cell proliferation dye (Thermofisher, #C34554) at 106 cells/mL in sterile pre-warmed PBS. After two washing, Teff were suspended in supplemented RPMI at 104 cells in 100 \u00b5L. Suppression assay was performed in U-bottom 96 well plates (Falcon, #353077) during 4 days at 37 \u00b0C, 20% O2. CFSE-stained Teff cells (104 cells/100 \u00b5L) were incubated with Treg cells (Treg: Teff ratio of 2:1) alone, Treg pre-incubated with CAF-S1 pre-treated or not with anti-CD73 or isotype control. Proliferation of effector T cells was stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Gibco, #11131D, 103 beads/100 \u00b5L). CSFE-stained Teff cells alone and CSFE-stained Teff cells in presence of anti-CD3/CD28 beads only were used as a negative and positive control of proliferation, respectively. After 4 days, T cells were collected in 15 mL tube and washed with PBS+. After discarding the supernatants, cells were resuspended in 150 \u00b5L of PBS+ and transferred in 96-well plate, V bottom. Cells were stained with anti-CD4 antibody (1:20, Miltenyi Biotec, #130-113-210) diluted in PBS+ for 15 min at RT protected from light. After a washing step, T lymphocytes were suspended in 50 \u00b5L of PBS+ and analyzed by LSRFORTESSA\u2122 analyzer (BD biosciences). A total of 2.5 \u00b5g/mL of DAPI was added immediately previous the acquisition. At least 5 \u00d7 105 events were recorded. Data were examined using FlowJo 10.5.2. Among alive and single cells, CD4+ CSFE+ T effector cells were selected. Among CD4+ FITC+ T cells, CFSE MFI was selected to assess the proliferation. According to negative control of proliferation, i.e., CD4+ CFSE+ T effector without anti-CD3/CD28 beads, MFI of CFSE of non-proliferating and MFI of CFSE of the whole CD4+ FITC+ population were assessed for each condition. The percentage of suppression of T effector cell proliferation has been calculated as follow: ((log2 (y) of Teff alone \u2212 log2(y) Teff + Treg)/(log2 (y) Teff alone)) \u00d7 100. Y corresponds to CFSE MFI in the whole population divided by CFSE MFI in the non-proliferating cells.2.12. Statistical AnalysisAs previously published by the \u201cStress and Cancer\u201d lab headed by Dr. F. Mechta-Grigoriou, data shown are means \u00b1 SEM (unless otherwise specified) and indicated in each figure legend. The number of tumors analyzed, or the number of independent experiments performed are specified in each figure legend, with at least 3 independent experiments, unless otherwise specified. The statistical test types used are in agreement with data distribution and are indicated in figure legend. First, normality was checked using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and then parametric or non-parametric two-tailed tests were applied accordingly. Differences were considered as statistically significant at values of p \u2264 0.05. Spearman\u2019s correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation coefficient between two parameters. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software.3. Results3.1. Accumulation of Regulatory T Lymphocytes in Breast Cancer Is Correlated with CD73 Expression in the StromaTo investigate the link between CD73 expression and T lymphocyte infiltration in BC, we first characterized CD73 protein levels in a retrospective cohort of 215 BC patients, including the three molecular subtypes, i.e., Luminal (LumA), HER2 and triple-negative (TN) BC (Table 1 for detailed description of the retrospective cohort studied). In that aim, we had access to samples for which CAF subsets enrichment and T lymphocyte infiltration have been previously quantified. CD73 protein level and pattern were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on these BC samples. We first observed that CD73 protein level was heterogeneous in the different BC subtypes, as well as from one tumor to another within the same BC subtype (Figure 1A). We quantified CD73 protein levels by assessing CD73 histological scores (HScores) in each BC sample. When we first quantified CD73 Hscores in total BC sections without differentiating stromal and epithelial staining, we did not see any difference between BC subtypes (Supplementary Figure S1A), thereby confirming CD73 RNA levels found in bulk BC of the TCGA cohort (Supplementary Figure S1B). However, different CD73 protein levels were observed not only between different BC subtypes, but also between cellular compartments. Some tumors showed a strong staining in cancer cells (epithelial compartment) but a weak staining in CAF (stromal compartment), while other tumors exhibited high staining in CAF but low in cancer cells. We thus evaluated CD73 protein levels in each BC sample considering epithelial and stromal compartments separately (Figure 1B). By this way, we observed that CD73 protein level was higher in the epithelium of LumA (median CD73 Hscore = 294) compared to HER2 (median Hscore = 260) and TN BC (median Hscore = 237) (Figure 1B, left). In contrast, CD73 protein level was higher in the stroma of HER2 (median Hscore = 100) than in LumA (median Hscore = 56) and TN (median CD73 Hscore = 69) BC (Figure 1B, right). Considering this heterogeneity between epithelial and stromal CD73 histological scores, we next evaluated if there was any association between CD73 protein levels in epithelium and stroma in each BC subtype. Notably, we found a positive correlation between CD73 staining in stroma and epithelium in LumA and TN, but not in HER2 BC (Figure 1C). CD73 was shown to be highly expressed at RNA levels in a specific CAF subpopulation expressing FAP (FAP+ CAF-S1 fibroblasts). We next investigated CD73 protein levels in the different CAF subpopulations we previously identified in BC. To do so, we took advantage of the CAF-subset enrichments that we have established in the retrospective cohort of BC patients studied here (see also Table 1). Most LumA tumors were enriched in CAF-S2 and CAF-S4 subsets, HER2 tumors in CAF-S4 or at a lesser extent in CAF-S1, and TN tumors either in CAF-S1 or in CAF-S4 (Table 1). Remarkably, in all BC subtypes, CD73 protein level was significantly higher in the stroma of CAF-S1-enriched tumors (median CD73 Hscore = 169) compared to CAF-S2- (median Hscore = 32.5) or CAF-S4-enriched (median Hscore = 73) BC (Figure 1D), thereby showing that CD73 accumulates in CAF-S1 fibroblasts in BC, as observed at mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure S1C).As CAF-S1 fibroblasts are able to promote FOXP3+ T lymphocyte accumulation and activity, we next evaluated the potential association between CD73, as a single marker of immunosuppressive CAF-S1 fibroblasts, and FOXP3+ T lymphocytes enriched in regulatory T cells (Tregs). As previously reported, the content in both CD3+ and FOXP3+ T lymphocytes was higher in TN (median FOXP3+ cells/mm2 = 22.9) and HER2 (median FOXP3+ cells/mm2 = 23.8) BC than in LumA (median FOXP3+ cells/mm2 = 7.7) BC (Supplementary Figure S1D,E). Interestingly, FOXP3+ T lymphocyte infiltration was significantly correlated with CD73 protein levels in the stroma but not in the epithelium of LumA and TN BC (Figure 1E,F), suggesting that CD73-mediated immunosuppression is exerted through CD73 expression in CAF rather than in cancer cells. In contrast, neither CD73 protein level in the stroma nor in the epithelium was associated with global CD3+ T lymphocyte infiltration (Figure 1G,H), showing that stromal CD73 is associated with FOXP3+-enriched micro-environment, but not with a global T cell infiltration. Taken as a whole, these data show that CD73 protein accumulates both in stroma and in epithelium in a coordinated but different manner. Interestingly, CD73-stromal expression is significantly associated with FOXP3+ T cell content, while CD73 expression in epithelium is not, thereby suggesting that CD73 protein in the stroma may drive its immunosuppressive function.3.2. CAF-S1 Primary Fibroblasts Exhibit High CD73 Enzymatic ActivityConsidering the positive correlation between stromal CD73 protein and FOXP3+ T cell content in BC, we next defined the specific function of CAF-S1-expressed CD73 on FOXP3+ T lymphocytes by performing functional assays. To do so, we isolated CAF-S1 primary cell lines from human BC surgical specimens (Supplementary Figure S2A) and confirmed the CAF-S1 identity by multicolor flow cytometry combining several fibroblast markers (FAP, CD29, \u03b1-SMA, PDGFR\u03b2) (Figure 2A,B), as previously shown in. 18 human primary CAF-S1 cell lines were successfully isolated from fresh samples from 18 different BC patients of the 3 molecular subtypes (LumA, HER2, TN BC) and their CD73 surface protein level was assessed by flow cytometry. We confirmed that CD73 protein was detected at the surface of all CAF-S1 primary cell lines but at variable levels, as observed in stroma of BC patients (Specific CD73 MFI: Mean = 56; SEM = 11; Min = 14, Max = 216) (Figure 2C,D). We next showed that CD73 protein was enzymatically active in CAF-S1 primary cell lines through the measurement of exogenous AMP hydrolysis (Figure 2E). Interestingly, CD73 enzymatic activity was significantly correlated with its protein level at the surface of CAF-S1 fibroblast cell lines (Figure 2F). These data show that CAF-S1 cell lines isolated from human BC express active CD73 enzyme at their surface, thereby confirming that these established cell lines constitute appropriate in vitro cellular models to study stromal CD73 function.3.3. CD73+ CAF-S1 Primary Fibroblasts Promote the Increase in PD-1+ CTLA-4+ FOXP3+ CD4+ CD25+ T LymphocytesAs we showed that CD73 protein level in stroma is correlated with FOXP3+ T cell content in BC patients (Figure 1), we investigated the role of CAF-S1-expressed CD73 on CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes. We first performed functional assays by co-culturing primary CAF-S1 fibroblasts isolated from BC patients with CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes from healthy donors (Supplementary Figure S2B). As reported in breast and ovarian cancers, we confirmed that primary CAF-S1 cells co-cultured with CD4+ CD25+ T cells significantly increased the percentage of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T lymphocytes (Fold-change = 1.6) (Figure 3A,B), with a strong impact on CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3high sub-population (Fold-change = 4.2) (Figure 3B, right). In addition to the increase in the percentage of FOXP3+ CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes, CAF-S1 also stimulated FOXP3 protein level in these cells (Fold-change = 1.2) (Figure 3C). Interestingly, we found that CAF-S1 fibroblasts significantly enhanced the percentages of PD-1+ (Figure 3D,E) and CTLA-4+ cells (Fold-changes = 1.2 and 1.4) (Figure 3G,H) among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ lymphocytes, as well as among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3low-med and CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3high T cells. Moreover, CAF-S1 significantly increased CTLA-4 protein level at the surface of CTLA-4+ FOXP3+ T lymphocytes (Fold-change = 1.3), but not PD-1 protein level at the surface of PD-1+ FOXP3+ T cells (Figure 3F,I). Furthermore, CAF-S1 cell lines significantly increased the percentages of PD-1+ CTLA-4+ double-positive cells among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T lymphocytes (Fold-change = 1.5) (Figure 3J,K). On the opposite, the proportion of double-negative PD-1- CTLA-4- cells among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T lymphocytes was reduced in presence of CAF-S1 primary cell lines (Fold-change = 0.8) (Figure 3J,K). In contrast to PD-1 and CTLA-4, CD73 or CD39 protein levels and percentages of positive cells among CD25+ FOXP3+ Tregs did not significantly change in presence of CAF-S1 fibroblasts (Figure 3L\u2013N and Figure S2C\u2013F). In conclusion, CAF-S1 fibroblasts significantly increase the content in PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ T cells among Tregs, thereby highlighting the key function of CAF-S1 in regulating checkpoint inhibitors at the surface of T lymphocytes.3.4. Anti-CD73 Antibody Impairs CAF-S1-Mediated Immunosuppression by Preventing PD-1 and CTLA-4 Up-Regulation in TregsAs CAF-S1 fibroblasts exhibited high CD73 protein levels and enzymatic activity, we next tested the impact of CD73 inhibition on CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppression. To do so, we evaluated the effect of a humanized anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody on human CAF-S1 fibroblasts. This antibody has been shown to specifically recognize CD73 protein and to efficiently inhibit its enzymatic activity. We first evaluated the capacity of the anti-CD73 antibody (Ab) to inhibit CAF-S1 CD73 enzymatic activity by testing several antibody concentrations. The anti-CD73 Ab inhibited CD73 enzymatic activity of CAF-S1 in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4A). In parallel, we compared the efficacy of the anti-CD73 Ab to a chemical CD73 inhibitor, the Adenosine 5\u2032-(\u03b1, \u03b2-methylene) diphosphate (APCP) (Figure 4B) and to an isotype control (IC) antibody (Figure 4C). We found that the impact of anti-CD73 Ab\u2014at the chosen concentration for further analysis (10 \u03bcg/mL)\u2014was as efficient as APCP (Figure 4B), reducing the CD73 enzymatic activity by an average of 62.5%, while the IC control had not effect, as expected (Figure 4C).We next evaluated the impact of anti-CD73 Ab on CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppressive activity and compared it to IC (Figure 4D\u2013O). Pre-incubation of CAF-S1 with anti-CD73 Ab significantly prevented the increase of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ T lymphocyte content by CAF-S1 (Figure 4D,E left). This effect was observed for both CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3high and FOXP3low-med T cells (Figure 4D,E middle, right). In addition, CD73 inhibition on CAF-S1 also prevented CAF-S1-mediated increase of FOXP3 protein level at the surface of FOXP3+ CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes (Figure 4F). Interestingly, blockade of CD73 on CAF-S1 also prevented the increase of PD-1+ (Figure 4G,H) and CTLA-4+ T cell percentages among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ lymphocytes (Figure 4J,K), in particular among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3high T cells (Figure 4H,K right). Moreover, CAF-S1 pre-treatment with anti-CD73 Ab impaired the increase of CTLA-4 protein levels at the surface of CTLA-4+ CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes (Figure 4L). The increase of PD-1+ CTLA-4+ double positive cells among CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ lymphocytes by CAF-S1 was also affected by pre-treatment of CAF-S1 fibroblasts with anti-CD73 Ab (Figure 4M,N left). Thus, all immunosuppressive features induced by CAF-S1 on CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocytes are abrogated by inhibition of CD73 activity in CAF-S1 fibroblasts.Based on the impact of the anti-CD73 Ab on CAF-S1-induced Tregs features, we next investigated if CD73 blockade on CAF-S1 could also impair Treg activity, i.e., their ability to suppress effector T lymphocyte proliferation. We previously showed that CAF-S1 fibroblasts enhanced the ability of Tregs to suppress the proliferation of effector T cells. Interestingly, CD73 inhibition on CAF-S1 prevented CAF-S1 to enhance Tregs activity, meaning Tregs capacity to reduce effector T cell proliferation (Figure 4O,P). Thus, the anti-CD73 Ab not only decreased CAF-S1 capacity to modulate Treg characteristics but also immunosuppressive function. Taken as a whole, these data show that CD73 is a key actor of CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppression. Consistent with this observation, CAF-S1-immunosuppressive activity is efficiently reduced by the use of anti-CD73 antibody.4. DiscussionAn important contributing factor to the poor clinical outcomes in BC is the highly immunosuppressive TME. This observation highlights the need to identify new mechanisms promoting tumor immune escape that can be targeted for increasing immunotherapy efficiency. The contribution of CAF in the promotion of immunosuppressive TME has been previously described. Several mechanisms related to CAF-mediated immunosuppression have been reported. Many of them include secretion of different soluble factors (TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL12, and CCL2), which promote recruitment and activation of immunosuppressive populations, especially Tregs. A meta-analysis has shown that FOXP3+ Tregs have a significant negative effect on overall survival (OS) in BC patients, and are associated with estrogen and progesterone receptor status, as well as with lymph node metastases. In line with these data, we observed here that the global infiltration of CD3+ T cells, in particular of FOXP3+ T lymphocytes, is higher in TN BC than in Lum BC, thereby confirming previous studies. Despite high T cell infiltration, recent data from clinical trials demonstrated that there is high proportion of TN BC patients who do not respond to immunotherapies. Importantly, CAF-S1 enrichment is associated with increased Tregs infiltration in TN BC and with immunotherapy resistance in melanoma and lung cancer patients. Interestingly, CD73, an enzyme that promotes tumor immune escape through production of extracellular adenosine, is highly expressed in CAF-S1. Moreover, we demonstrate here that CD73 is a key actor in CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppression, thereby arguing that CD73 might be an interesting therapeutic target for improving immunotherapy sensitivity.During the last decade, numerous evidences revealed the role of CD73 as alternative immune checkpoint, which prevents anti-tumor immune response. Indeed, as CD73 catalyzes the production of immunosuppressive adenosine, it has been hypothesized that CD73 prevents tumor destruction by inhibiting antitumor immunity. Several studies demonstrate that CD73 expressed on host hematopoietic and tumor cells impairs anti-tumor immune escape in colon, prostate and breast cancer mouse models. However, the role of CD73 in CAF within human cancers remained poorly described.In the present study, we go a step further by highlighting the predominant function of CD73 in CAF on Tregs infiltration in human BC. Indeed, we provide here one of the first in-depth and highly-resolutive study on CD73 protein function in human breast cancer. Consistent with our findings, CAF were also recently identified as a major source of CD73 to have an impact on colorectal cancer development. Indeed, abundance of CD73+ CAF is associated with elevated CD73 activity and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. This is consistent with the high CD73 protein level we reveal here in the stroma of TN and HER2 BC, the two most aggressive BC subtypes. CD73 expression on T lymphocytes is stimulated by TGF\u03b2-signaling pathway. Interestingly, we previously highlighted the role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in CAF-S1 functions and its reciprocal crosstalk with cancer cells, suggesting TGF\u03b2 might be a key regulator of CD73 expression in CAF-S1. Moreover, the crosstalk between CAF and T lymphocytes plays an important role in the regulation of stromal CD73 expression. Indeed, ex vivo study with CAF isolated from lung cancer showed how T cells up-regulates CD73 on CAF in lung cancer through IFN\u03b3 secretion.In addition, we highlight that CD73 is highly expressed in one particular CAF subset, characterized by high level of FAP and referred to as CAF-S1, and that CD73 expression in these cells promotes the increase in the proportion of CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+, PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ T lymphocytes. Moreover, we demonstrate that CD73-specific antibody impairs CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppression, thereby highlighting that CAF-S1 fibroblasts exert their immunosuppressive activity in a CD73-dependent manner. Low CD73 expression and high global infiltration of CD45+ immune cells exhibit additive prognostic values and are indicative of a good clinical outcome in TN BC patients with invaded lymph nodes. In agreement with these data and in line with the correlation between stromal CD73 expression and Treg infiltration we report here in LumA and TN BC, high content in cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (assessed by the CD8+/CD3+ ratio) is associated with a good overall survival in BC patients. Consistent with these observations, pre-clinical studies revealed that CD73 expression inhibits specific anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response in mammary tumors. Moreover, bone marrow transplantations established that both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic CD73 expression are important to promote tumor immune escape in these mouse models.Thus, while CD73 has been initially defined as a co-signaling molecule on T lymphocytes, it is now clear that CD73 exerts pro-tumorigenic functions in tumor cells but also in stromal fibroblasts, as we highlight here on Treg accumulation. Stromal CD73 represents a potential novel immune checkpoint in BC that can be effectively targeted in CAF using anti-CD73 antibody. In addition, our data support the interest to combine anti-CD73 therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and/or anti-PD-1 to overcome potential resistances related to concomitant PD-1 and CTLA-4 up-regulation in FOXP3+ T lymphocytes.5. ConclusionsCancer-associated fibroblasts are the most dominant cell type in TME of breast tumors. Numerous findings have convincingly demonstrated the tumor promoting effects of CAFs in breast tumors, including their contribution to immunosuppression. Hence, CAF represents an emergent interesting target of immunotherapy. This study reveals that CD73-depended immunosuppression mediated by specific CAF subset (CAF-S1) in breast cancer can be impaired using a blocking anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of anti-CD73 Ab as compound for novel strategy to target breast CAF.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: CD73 total RNA and protein levels did not differ among BC subtypes, Figure S2: CAF-S1 do not modify CD73+ and CD39+ content in CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ Tregs.Author ContributionsF.M.-G. conceived the project and designed the experiments.

Vincent-Salomon, is authorized to store and manage human biological samples when patient consent forms are obtained (declaration of sample collections: #DC-2008-57). The BRC follows all currently required French and international ethical rules, including the declaration of Helsinki, and has been accredited with the AFNOR NFS-96-900 quality label. BRC collections have been declared to the CNIL (Approval Nb: 1487390 delivered 28 February 2011). Finally, the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee of the Institute Curie Hospital Group approved all analyses realized in this study (Approval of the Tumour Micro-environment project given 12 February 2014), as well as the National Commission for Data Processing and Liberties (Approval Nb: 1674356 delivered on 30 March 2013), authorizations obtained by F. Mechta-Grigoriou.Informed Consent StatementAnalysis of tumor samples was performed according to the relevant national law protecting people taking part in biomedical research. There was no interference with standard clinical practice. All patients included in the retrospective cohort were diagnosed before 2012. At that time, the principle of non-opposition was the French legal requirement. All patients included in our study were informed by their referring oncologist that their biological samples could be used for research purposes. A certificate attesting that patients have read the booklet is signed by each patient and included in their medical records. In case of patient refusal, that could be either orally expressed or written, residual tumor samples were not included in our study. For the prospective cohort of patients taking in charge until 2020, we aligned ourselves with the General Data Protection regulation (GDPR) when it was voted in France in 2019, Institut Curie provides a systematic explicit consent form that every patient needs to sign before the samples are used for research. Then, all patients included in the prospective cohort of patients signed this consent. All data collected were made pseudo-anonymous for further analyses and patient privacy was protected.Data Availability StatementThe data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding authors.Conflicts of InterestF.M.-G. received research support from Innate-Pharma, Roche and Bristol-Myers-Squibb (BMS).

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the initiation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer. However, whether autophagy acts as a tumor promotion mechanism by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is still controversial and remains undefined at the mechanistic levels. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 is required for the invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT of breast cancer cells and underlying mechanism. We employed an in vitro model of NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub and confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 could convert fibroblasts into CAFs through autophagy under oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Modulation of autophagy by rapamycin, 3-methyladenine or ATG-5 knockdown regulated the expression of CAFs markers, suggesting a role of autophagy in the tumor promotion mechanism of TGF-\u03b21-induced CAFs activation. Furthermore, we established an indirect co-culture model and a mixed xenograft as a corresponding in vivo model. We demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT, which act through autophagy and overexpression of FAP-\u03b1 in both models, while autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked these effects induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Moreover, the co-localization of LC3\u03b2 and EMT marker vimentin in mixed xenograft also revealed that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor growth, pulmonary metastasis, and EMT program partly through autophagy. In addition, knockdown of FAP-\u03b1 resulted in reversed EMT and abolished tumor invasion and pulmonary metastasis induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Taken together, we conclude that both autophagy and FAP-\u03b1 are required for breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Targeting autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 rather than both can serve as a potential approach to improve the prognosis for human breast cancer.",

Conclusions: These results provide a novel insight into breast CAF-induced tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner.IntroductionTumor angiogenesis is critical to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In the absence of blood vessels, tumor growth stays at dormancy within the diameter of 1-2 mm. Tumor cells produce chemical compounds to trigger tumor angiogenesis, in which endothelial cells from the existing blood vessels degrade basement membrane, invade through extracellular matrix, and migrate toward the tumors, then proliferate and sprout to form new blood vessels.Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic molecules in the tumor. One of these molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) activates a crucial signaling pathway in tumor angiogenesis by binding to its cognate receptor (VEGFR). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved antiangiogenic drugs including Bevacizumab, Axitinib, Sorafenib and Sunitinib that target VEGF or VEGFR, which have shown clinical efficacies in some patients with colon cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal carcinoma. However, blocking VEGF alone has no meaningful benefit for some cancer patients. For example, anti-VEGF therapy failed to establish overall survival effects for patients with metastatic breast cancer; only 12% of patients experienced prolonged significant overall survival in phase III randomized clinical trials. This suggests that additional factors or pathways independent of VEGF signaling may be implicated in tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, multiple mechanisms have been revealed to induce resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy, including angiogenic factors bFGF, PIGF and PDGF, and pathways of Notch-DLL4 and NRP1-ABL1. These VEGF-independent mechanisms represent potential new therapeutics valuable for improving outcomes for cancer patients.Recently the tumor angiogenic roles of stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment have been investigated extensively. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils and mast cells directly stimulate the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells via secreting proangiogenic factors VEGF, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b1. Bone marrow (BM)-derived precursor cells mobilize to tumor tissue and contribute to the newly formed vessels and growth. Extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin transduce angiogenic signals by binding to integrins on the endothelial cells, inducing their proliferation and migration.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), activated fibroblasts secreting higher levels of cytokines and growth factors, are the major stromal residents in tumor stroma and favor tumor growth and metastasis partly through promoting tumor angiogenesis. The mouse embryonic fibroblasts are recognized to promote angiogenesis and tumorigenesis via VEGF. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that CAF also contributes to angiogenesis by expressing angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 in ovarian carcinoma or by depositing ECM proteins involved in angiogenesis. Fibroblasts that have been \u201ceducated\u201d by skin carcinoma cells have been shown to mediate innate immune cell recruitment and promote tumor growth by stimulating angiogenesis. Interestingly, CAFs from resistant EL4 tumors can also mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy via VEGF-independent PDGF-C signaling. However, the complicated mechanism underlying how the CAFs in breast cancers promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis is not well understood.Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis. miRNAs have been shown to signal in tumor cells by regulating angiogenic factors such as VEGF. Specifically, miRNAs may be involved in the control of endothelial cell recruitment and function. miRNA regulates crosstalk between tumor and microenvironment, but miRNAs in breast CAFs that drive the angiogenesis have not been identified. Our previous work identified a set of dysregulated miRNAs in breast CAFs, and miR-205 was found to be significantly downregulated in CAFs, suggesting their essential role in CAF function. It has been revealed that reduced miR-205 expression in breast cancer cells promotes tumor growth, migration and invasion. However, whether the stromal miR-205 in breast CAFs could promote tumor growth and metastasis by orchestrating activation of fibroblasts and stimulating tumor angiogenesis needs to be determined.Yes-associated protein (YAP1) is a core downstream effector of Hippo pathway, regulating organ development, cell proliferation and differentiation. As a transcriptional coactivator, YAP1 interacts with transcription factors (e.g., TEAD family, SMAD), regulating its target genes' functions in many biological processes. Enhanced YAP1 expression has been found in some carcinomas of the lung, prostate, colon, and breast, triggering tumor initiation, reprogramming of cancer cells into cancer stem cells (CSCs), or promoting tumor growth, proliferation and metastasis. Recently, it has been reported that overexpressed YAP1 in cholangiocarcinoma promotes angiogenesis by regulating pro-angiogenic MFAP5 expression. Whether stromal YAP1 in breast CAFs regulates VEGF-independent angiogenesis mechanisms remains to be determined.In this study, we demonstrate that breast CAFs are closely associated with tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner. Reduced miR-205 expression in breast fibroblasts activates NFs into CAFs by targeting YAP1. Particularly, miR-205 and YAP1-mediated CAF activation promotes angiogenesis even in the absence of VEGF signaling. Except for VEGF, IL11 and IL15 are regulated by YAP1 in CAFs and stimulate angiogenesis resistance to anti-VEGF therapy and activate STAT3 signaling in endothelial cells. Rescue of miR-205 or loss of YAP1 in CAFs suppresses tumor growth and metastasis by reducing tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism by which breast stromal CAF contributes to cancer growth and metastasis by tumor angiogenesis via a VEGF-independent manner, suggesting potential novel therapeutic strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy.Materials and MethodsClinical samplesBreast tumor tissues and their adjacent normal tissues used in this study were obtained from patients with breast cancer at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients had previously received radiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The investigation was approved by the ethics committee of Chongqing Medical University.Stromal fibroblasts isolation, immortalization, and cell cultureCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from breast tumor tissues or their paired normal tissues as described previously. Briefly, fresh tumor tissue and the corresponding normal tissue were washed with sterile PBS containing antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin and 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamycin), minced into small pieces and digested for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.5% mg/mL collagenase type I (Sigma, USA). The digested tissues were carefully pipetted using culture DMEM (Invitrogen, USA), and the mixtures were centrifuged to remove the fat and tissue debris. The mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS (GIBCO-BRL, USA) until the fibroblasts adhered to the dish, and other cellular types in the suspension were removed. Cell purity of stromal fibroblasts was identified by the test of fibroblast biomarker fibronectin (FN), CAFs-specific markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), epithelial cell markers cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18 (CK8+18) and endothelial cell marker CD31. NFs and CAFs were immortalized by human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) as described previously. NFs and CAFs were culture in DMEM with 10% FBS, and HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Plasmid constructs and reagentsLV3-puro-miR-205 and LV3-puro-anti-miR-205 (the shRNA specifically targeting miR-205) were purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The pSUPER-vector and pSUPER-miR-205 vector were kindly provided by Dr J\u00f6rg Hackerm\u00fcller (RNomics Group, Germany). The pBABE-YAP1 vector was obtained from Addgene (Boston, USA). Full-length IL11 and IL15 cDNA were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pBABE-puro vector at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The shRNAs specifically against YAP1 were cloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX-shRNA1 (Clontech, USA) at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The siRNA sequences specifically against miR-205 and the genes are listed in Table S1. To generate WT-YAP1 3'UTR-Luc, Mut-YAP1 3'UTR-Luc, IL11 promoter-Luc, and IL15 promoter-Luc reporters, the synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) that correspond to the wild-type or the mutated binding sites of miR-205 in the 3'-UTR of YAP1, and the IL11 or IL15 promoter were separately cloned into the PMIR-Reporter vector (Ambion, USA) at Spe I and Hind III sites.The reagents used in this study in vitro are as follows: Axitinib (Selleck, USA), 5 nM; S3I-201 (Selleck, USA), 20 \u03bcM; MTT (Beyotime, China), 5 mg/mL; for preparation of conditioned medium, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech), 0.2 mg/mL; Neutralizing antibody against IL11 (ab89887, Abcam), 5 \u03bcg/mL; IL15 (MAB2471, R&D Systems), 5 \u03bcg/mL; control antibody (MAB002, MAB003, R&D Systems), 5 \u03bcg/mL.Luciferase assayFor 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay, cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells in 24-well plates and co-transfected with pSUPER-miR-205 and pMIR-YAP1 3'-UTR (wild-type or mutant) and the control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, USA) by using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For promoter reporter assay, cells were co-transfected with shRNA (Control or YAP1), pMIR-promoter (IL11 or IL15) and pRL-TK. Luciferase activities were performed by using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, USA) after 48 h, and normalized by using pRL-TK reporters as an internal control.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)The deparaffinized tissue sections at 4 \u03bcm thick were heated for antigen retrieval at 95 \u00b0C in citric acid buffer (pH 6.0). After treating with 3% H2O2, the sections were blocked with 5% goat normal serum, and incubated with primary antibody against \u03b1-SMA (1:100, ab5694, Abcam), CD31 (1:50, ab9498, Abcam, UK) and YAP1 (1:200, sc-398182, Santa Cruz, USA), separately. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining as described previously. \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and CD31+ endothelial cells were scored by mean optical density (density/area) using Image-pro plus 6.0 software. YAP1 staining in stromal tissues was scored into 5 intensities: 0, no staining; 1+, 1%-25%; 2+, 26%-50%; 3+, 51%-75%; 4+, 76%-100%. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on pre-prepared coverslips for 24 h. After being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated by 0.1% triton-100, and incubated with 5% goat serum, the cells were separately stained with antibody specifically against FN (1:150, ab32419, Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (1:150), FAP (1:150, ab53066, Abcam), cytokeratin (CK8+CK18) (1:200, ab53280, Abcam), and CD31 (1:80) at 4 \u00b0C for overnight, then labelled with FITC-labeled secondary antibody (ZSBIO, China). The nuclei were stained with DAPI and the images were captured by a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope.MTT and Flow cytometric analysisStromal fibroblast cells (3 \u00d7 103 per well) were seeded into a 96-well plate, and cell growth was measured every day by MTT bromide assay at a wavelength of 492 nm on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader. Cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle (using standard propidium iodide staining), apoptotic cells (using standard Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide Kit (Beyotime, China)), and stromal fibroblasts were analyzed by flow cytometry with an FCdevice (Beckman, USA). Experiments were repeated in triplicate.RNA extraction and qRT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). The purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to form cDNA using a reverse transcriptase kit (Takara, China), quantitative real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, Dalian, China). The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in the Table S2.Invasion assaysTranswell invasion assays were conducted using a 8 \u03bcm pore chamber coated with Matrigel (Corning BioCoat, USA) as described previously. Cells were allowed to invade toward medium in the lower chamber, and the invaded cells on the opposite side of the filter were stained with hematoxylin in methanol and counted after 8 h for fibroblasts and 20 h for HUVECs.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and antibody neutralization testThe stromal fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 106) were seeded into a 6 well plate in growth medium for 6 h. After removing the growth medium, FBS-free medium (1 mL) was added to further culture for 30 h, and the supernate was collected as conditioned medium (CM). To exclude the potential side effects of cell proliferation and apoptosis of CAFs and NFs (e.g. the engineered CAFs and NFs , and their control cells) on CM, total cell numbers, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and protein concentration (using Bradford assay kit, Beyotime, China) of CM were carefully determined at CM collection time point. For neutralization experiments, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF, IL11, or IL15 was preincubated at 4 \u00b0C with 1 mL supernatant for 6 h, then used for HUVECs co-culture in tubulogenesis or sprouting experiments.Tubule formation and three-dimensional sprouting assaysHUVECs (1 \u00d7 104) were cultured with 150 \u03bcL conditioned medium in 96-well plates precoated with 50 \u03bcL of growth factor-deprived Matrigel. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h, tubule formations were analyzed by using Image J software. For endothelial cell sprouting assays, HUVECs (1 \u00d7 103) were cultured with medium containing 0.24% carboxymethylcellulose in non-adherent round-bottom 96-well plates overnight. Spheroids were collected by centrifugation at 400 xg and mixed with 2 mg/mL fibrinogen (Corning) and FBS-free medium. The three-dimensional fibrin gel was then covered with CM and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 24 h. Endothelial sprouting was analyzed with at least 10 spheroids per group and quantified by recording the branch number under a microscope.Western blotting and ELISA assaysCell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The specific primary antibodies used in Western blotting analysis are as follows: FAP (1:1000, ab53066, Abcam, UK), \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, ab5694, Abcam), IL11 (1:1000, ab89887, Abcam), IL15 (1:800, ab7213, Abcam); VEGFA (1:1000, wl00009b, Wanleibio, China); p-VEGFR2 (1:800, D155165, Sangon, China), T-VEGFR2 (1:1000, D151118, Sangon), p-KIT (1:800, D151515, Sangon), p-PDGFR\u03b2 (1:800, D151409, Sangon); FXR1 (1:1000, BS70701, bioworld, China); YAP1 (1:1000, sc-398182, Santa Cruz, USA); T-STAT3 (1:1000, #4904, CST, USA), p-STAT3 (1:1000, #9131, CST), T-AKT (1:1000, #9272, CST), p-AKT (1:1000, #2965, CST), T-ERK (1:1000, #9102, CST), p-ERK (1:1000, #4348, CST), T-P38 (1:1000, #9212, CST), p-P38 (1:1000, #4631, CST) and \u03b2-Actin (1:1500, ZSBIO, China). For ELISA assay, conditioned medium was collected from 1 \u00d7 106 NFs or CAFs in a 6-well plate, and the concentrations of IL11 and IL15 were measured using a standard ELISA Kit (Raybiotech, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Orthotopic XenograftsThe orthotopic tumor xenografts models were as described previously. Animal experiments were approved by the animal care ethics committees at Chongqing Medical University. MDA-MB-231 cells (1 \u00d7 106) were mixed with equal number of CAF/Ctrl (CAF/miR-Ctrl, CAF/sh-Ctrl) or engineered CAF cells (CAF/miR-205, CAF/sh-YAP1) in 200 \u03bcL of PBS:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice. Tumor size was assessed by caliper measurements every three days; volume was calculated ((L \u00d7 w2) \u00d7 0.5). When the tumor volume was around 100 mm3, the mice implanted with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/sh-Ctrl or CAF/sh-YAP1 were separately fed oral Axitinib twice a day at low- (30 mg/kg, 1 group) or high-concentrations (40 mg/kg, 1 group), or intraperitoneally administered with anti-VEGF antibody (10 mg/kg, three times a week; 1 group) (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech). Control mice received 0.5% Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC; 1 group) or appropriate sterile saline (1 group). At the end of animal experiments, tumors or mice lungs were serially sectioned into 4 \u03bcm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for subsequent blinded evaluation of MVD and metastases in the lungs.TCGA Bioinformatic AnalysisBioinformatic analysis was performed as described. We obtained the clinically annotated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) focused on expressions of miR-205, YAP1 and CD31 in breast cancer patients. To determine the progression free survival of patients, approximately 2/3 of the samples were used as a training cohort to obtain the thresholds yielding the most significant log rank test p-values (one-tailed test), which can divide the data into good and poor prognosis groups. The thresholds were then used to analyze the data in the remaining 1/3 of the samples, which functioned as validation cohort, and p-values were computed for those cohorts. All datasets were applied to assess survival differences between the low-expression and high-expression groups by the Kaplan-Meier curves.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using SPSS 17.0 software. The results are shown as means \u00b1 SD. Multiple groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, and single comparison between two groups was analyzed using Student's t-test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsBreast stromal CAFs closely correlate with tumor angiogenesis in VEGF-independent signalingWe observed abundant vessel-like structures in breast tumor stroma compared with its non-tumor stromal area by HE staining (Figure 1A) and CD31 staining (a specific biomarker of the vascular endothelial cell) (Figure 1B). Activated CAFs account for nearly 60-80% of breast cancer stroma cells, suggesting that the activated stromal fibroblasts may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. We examined \u03b1-SMA and CD31 protein levels by immunohistochemical staining in tumor tissues and their para-cancer (non-tumor) tissues from 93 breast cancer patients, including 21 with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 42 with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and 30 with metastatic carcinoma. \u03b1-SMA was negative in stromal fibroblasts in the non-tumor tissues (Figure S1A), while gradually stronger \u03b1-SMA expressions in CAFs and more plentiful microvessel density (MVD) were observed in the advanced breast tumor tissues (Figure 1C, Figure S1B). A positive correlation between the enhanced \u03b1-SMA and MVD was further disclosed by the Pearson's correlation analysis (Figure 1D). These results suggest that CAFs are the potential promoter of breast tumor angiogenesis.Furthermore, the angiogenesis-associated genes and factors classified by gene ontology analysis from mRNA microarray were significantly up-regulated in the primary CAFs (Figure 1E), whose purities were identified by fibroblast biomarker FN, the activated fibroblasts biomarkers, epithelial markers, and endothelium marker (Figure S1C-S1D). To assess whether CAFs affect the angiogenic behavior of vascular endothelial cells, a co-culture system including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs or NFs was employed. The proliferation (Figure 1F), invasion (Figure 1G) and tubule formation abilities (Figure 1H-1I) of HUVECs were dramatically enhanced by CM from CAFs. The addition of Axitinib (an effective inhibitor for activated VEGFR of vascular endothelial cells) (Figure S1E) in CM derived from CAFs or the CM treated with anti-VEGF antibody (Figure S1F) could not completely impede the CAF-induced invasion and tubule formation (Figure 1G-1I). These data suggest that the breast cancer stromal CAFs may contribute to VEGF-independent angiogenesis.Decreased miR-205 in CAFs contributes to breast tumor angiogenesisOur previous studies identified a set of dysregulated miRNAs in CAFs. MiR-205 was down-regulated in CAFs (Figure S2A-S2B), the MDA-MB-231 cell-educated fibroblasts (Figure S2C), and a set of primary CAFs freshly isolated from 21 patients with breast cancer (Figure 2A). Decreased miR-205 expression was found to be associated with higher CD31 levels and worse overall survival of breast cancer patients (Figure 2B, Figure S2D) after analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Similarly, the higher level of CD31 and the abundance of MVD were oppositively corresponding to lower levels of stromal miR-205 in the detected breast tumor tissues (Figure 2C). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the predicted targets of miR-205 were involved in angiogenesis and cell differentiation (Figure S2E). The several known angiogenic factors including VEGFA, TGFB1, IL6 were increased in NF/anti-miR-205 (loss of miR-205 by miR-205 inhibitor in NFs), decreased in CAF/miR-205 (over-expression of miR-205 in CAFs) in comparison to their control cells (Figure S2F). These data indicate that miR-205 in stromal fibroblasts potentially affects angiogenesis in breast tumors.Indeed, miR-205 in stromal fibroblasts is closely related to the pro-angiogenic phenotypes of HUVECs. Impeded miR-205 expression in NFs (NFs/anti-miR-205) was observed using its antisense sequences (anti-miR-205) (Figure S3A), and CM derived from the NFs/anti-miR-205 cells significantly promoted the migration, invasion (Figure S3B-S3C, upper), tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure 2D-2G, upper). Furthermore, after rescuing miR-205 expression in CAFs (CAFs/miR-205) (Figure S3A), CM from these CAFs (miR-205 overexpressing) disrupted the angiogenic potentials of HUVECs (Figure S3B-S3C, down; and Figure S3D-S3G, upper). These findings show that down-regulation of miR-205 in CAFs indeed promotes angiogenesis.VEGF, a major driving factor for tumor angiogenesis, was elevated in miR-205-silenced NFs or repressed in miR-205-overexpressing CAFs (Figure S3H). Interestingly, CM derived from CAFs still kept the ability to promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs in the presence of Axitinib (Figure 2D-2E and Figure S3D-S3E, down panel) or anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 2F-2G and Figure S3F-S3G, down panel). These data suggest a VEGF-independent proangiogenic function of miR-205 in CAFs.YAP1, a downstream target of miR-205, is associated with tumor angiogenesisTo further explore the functions of stromal miR-205 in regulating angiogenesis, we identified target genes of miR-205 by merging results (GSE39735) acquired from GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with miR-205 targets predicted by Target Scan and the up-regulated genes (fold change >2.0) in our previous mRNA expression profiles. We obtained 4 candidate genes including YAP1, HNRNPK, FXR1 and SLC4A4 (Figure 3A). Further analysis confirmed that only YAP1 was significantly changed at mRNA and protein levels in CAFs (Figure 3B-3D). The enhanced expression of YAP1 was observed in 3 immortalized CAFs (Figure 3E). In addition, the potential binding sites of miR-205 were identified in the YAP1 3'-UTR (Figure 3F), which led to a dramatic transcriptional suppression of YAP1 under ectopic expression of miR-205 (Figure 3G). Mutation of the binding sites in the YAP1 3'-UTR abolished the repression of miR-205 to YAP1 (Figure 3G), suggesting that YAP1 is a direct target of miR-205 in CAFs. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, high level of YAP1 was found to be positively related to CD31 expression in breast cancer (Figure 3H) and worse overall survival of breast cancer patients (Figure 3I). The high levels of YAP1 proteins in CAFs were further confirmed in the developed breast tumor tissues (Figure 3J), revealing a close correlation between YAP1 in stromal fibroblasts and MVD in these tissues (Figure 3K).YAP1 activating NFs into CAFs promotes angiogenesis via VEGF independent mannerTo investigate the pro-angiopoietic roles of YAP1 in CAFs, we transfected a retrovirus-mediated ectopic YAP1 construct into NFs, and suppressed YAP1 expression in CAFs using shRNA (Figure 4A, Figure S4A). YAP1-overexpression in NFs (NF/YAP1) or loss of endogenous YAP1 in CAF (CAF/sh-YAP1) resulted in activated NF or inactivated CAF, identified by \u03b1-SMA levels, cell proliferation and migration abilities (Figure 4A, Figure S4B-S4C), indicating that YAP1, as an effector of miR-205, is essential for CAF activation.Furthermore, the acquirement of ectopic YAP1 in NFs or loss of endogenous YAP1 in CAFs had no effect on VEGF expression (Figure 4A, Figure S4D). However, the CM from YAP1-overexpressing NFs promoted cell migration and invasion of HUVECs, and the CM from YAP1 knocked-down CAFs impeded these behaviors in HUVECs (Figure 4B). Correspondingly, CM from YAP1-overexpressing NF cells obviously facilitated the tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure S4E-S4H, upper), and CM from YAP1 knocked-down CAFs decreased HUVECs' tubule formation and sprouting abilities (Figure 4C-4F, upper). Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody could augment these observed effects of YAP1-silenced CAFs (Figure 4C-4F, down). However, overexpression of YAP1 in NFs attenuated the suppressive functions of Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody on tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure S4E-S4H, down). These findings were further confirmed by YAP1 rescue in miR-205 overexpressing CAFs (CAFs/miR-205), which notably abrogated the anti-angiogenic effects of miR-205 (Figure 4G-4H). These data suggest that YAP1 promotes angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells.IL11 and IL15, the YAP1 targets, display a concordant effect on VEGF-independent angiogenesisBased on the above findings, we proposed that some secreting factors other than VEGF in CAF's CM play a critical role in pro-angiogenesis. However, the known pro-angiogenic factors including SDF-1, VEGFA and FGF2 were not influenced by YAP1 in CAFs and YAP1-overexpressing NFs (NFs/YAP1) (Figure S4D). After careful analysis of the gene profiles from GEO database (GSE7700), which may be directly regulated by YAP1 and our previous mRNA profiles of CAFs by bioinformatics, HMGB1, CXCL14, IL6, IL11 and IL15 were identified as the YAP1-regulated candidate cytokines (Figure 5A). Actually, the mRNA expressions of IL6, IL11 and IL15 were down-regulated in YAP1 knock-down CAFs, and IL11 and IL15 were significantly affected by YAP1 in CAFs (Figure 5B). Overexpression of YAP1 in the miR-205-rescued CAFs (CAF/miR-205/YAP1) dramatically abrogated the suppressive effects of miR-205 on IL11 and IL15 (Figure 5C-5E). Luciferase assay showed that YAP1 could directly regulate IL11 and IL15 transcript expressions (Figure 5F).Following efficient knock-down of IL11 and IL15 in CAFs using their specific siRNA (Figure S5A-S5E), the corresponding CM decreased cell invasion (Figure S5F) and tubule formation of HUVECs (Figure 5G, upper; Figure S5G). Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody treatment further augmented the suppression of tubule formation of HUVECs (Figure 5G, down; Figure S5G). Similarly, CM from CAFs (Figure 5H) or YAP1-overexpressing NFs (NF/YAP1) (Figure S5H) neutralized with anti-IL11 and/or anti-IL15 antibodies reduced the tubule formation of HUVECs. These data suggest that IL11 and IL15, the secreting proteins of CAFs, are essential to breast tumor angiogenesis.IL11 and IL15 derived from CAFs activate STAT3 signaling in endothelial cellsTo understand the functional impact of IL11 and IL15 secreted by CAFs on pro-angiogenesis, the potential downstream signaling of interleukin family (e.g., JAK/STAT, ERK, PI3K/AKT) in HUVECs was examined. As shown in Figure 6A, a high level of phosphorylated STAT3 was detected in HUVECs that were co-cultured with CM derived from NFs/anti-miR-205 and CAFs. Knockdown of YAP1, or IL11, and IL15 in CAFs mitigated the activation of STAT3; simultaneous loss of IL11 and IL15 in CAFs could augment the inactivation of STAT3 in HUVECs (Figure 6A, 6B). However, the activation of VEGFR2 was not affected by these factors, except miR-205 (Figure 6A, 6C). Blockage of STAT3 signaling by inhibitor S3I-201 (Figure S6A) reduced cell invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs (Figure S6B-S6C). Furthermore, transfection of ectopic IL11 and IL15 into NFs significantly increased IL11 and IL15 secretion in the supernatant (Figure S6D-S6F), thus leading to the activation of STAT3 signaling (Figure S6G) and increased invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs (Figure 6D-6E), which could be remarkably abolished by S3I-201 but not Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 6E-6F).In order to adequately assess the pro-angiogenic functions of IL11/IL15 in CM derived from the CAFs, we first evaluated the different types of vectors on some of the molecular biological characteristics of NFs or CAFs. There were no significant differences in cell proliferation (Figure S7A), miR-205 expression (Figure S7B), protein levels of YAP1/IL11/IL15 (Figure S7C), and pro-angiogenic functions (Figure S7D-S7E) between NF/anti-miR-Ctrl and NF/pBABE-Ctrl; or among CAF/miR-Ctrl, CAF/sh-Ctrl and CAF/si-Ctrl (Figure S7A-7E), suggesting negligible side effects of vectors on the inherent biological characteristics of NFs or CAFs. Next, total cell numbers, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis of the used stromal fibroblasts and protein concentrations in the CM from all used stromal fibroblasts were determined at the terminal time point of CM collection. Despite overexpression of miR-205, or knockdown of YAP1, IL11 and IL15 in CAFs decreased cell proliferation, while knockdown of miR-205, or overexpression of YAP1, IL11, and IL15 in NFs increased cell proliferation (Figure S4B, S7F-S7H). In growth medium, the total cell numbers of parent CAFs and NFs, and the engineered CAFs and NFs were almost the same (Figure S8A), and cell proliferation of these cells also had no detectable changes at the terminal time point of CM (Figure S8B). However, the percentage of apoptotic and viable cells were found to be a little bit different among these cell populations (around 2%, P>0.05) (Figure S8C), thus leading to a tiny difference in protein concentrations in their CM (Figure S8D). Protein concentrations in FBS-containing growth medium from these CAFs and NFs also had no significant difference, which may be obscured by serum (Figure S8E). To understand whether IL11 and IL15 in CM are affected by cell apoptosis, the protein concentration of CM derived from activated fibroblasts was normalized using the protein concentration deviation value between activated fibroblasts and the control fibroblasts, and adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration of control cells; then IL11 and IL15 were detected by ELISA assay. IL11 and IL15 protein levels in CM derived from the activated fibroblasts were obviously higher than that in CM derived from the control fibroblasts (Figure S8F-S8G), which is similar to the above results (Figure 5D-5E, S5D-S5E and S6E-S6F). These data demonstrate that CM, especially angiogenic factors IL11 and IL15 derived from the activated stromal fibroblasts, are not affected by cell proliferation and cell apoptosis, but are closely governed by miR-205/YAP1 signaling and play essential roles in breast tumor angiogenesis.CAFs promote tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner to fuel breast tumor growth and metastasis in vivoTo investigate the function of miR-205/YAP1 signaling axis in pro-angiogenesis, MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with CAFs (labeled CAF/miR-Ctrl), CAFs/miR-205 or CAFs/sh-YAP1 were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Compared with the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with engineered CAFs (CAF/miR-205, CAF/sh-YAP1 (labeled CAF/sh-YAP1/CMC or Sal in Fig 7A)) had fewer blood vessels on the tumor surface, and less MVD and CD31 staining in tumor tissues (Figure 7A; Figure S9A-S9B). In contrast to blockage of VEGF signaling alone by Axitinib or by anti-VEGF antibody, YAP1-knock-down in CAFs combined with VEGF signaling inhibitors could augment the suppressive efficiencies to tumor angiogenesis (Figure 7A; Figure S9A-S9B), indicating that YAP1 acts as an obviously pro-angiogenic effector in the VEGF-independent pathway. Consistently, the levels of IL11 and IL15, the critical pro-angiogenic factors, which are regulated by miR-205 and YAP1 signaling axis, were reduced in the tumors with CAF/miR-205 or CAF/sh-YAP1 compared to their control tumors (Figure 7B). Moreover, phosphorylated STAT3 in tumors with CAF/miR-205 or CAF/sh-YAP1 significantly decreased (Figure 7B). Correspondingly, blockage of VEGF-independent tumor angiogenesis led to decreased tumor growth (Figure 7C, Figure S9C-S9D) and metastases in mice lung tissues (Figure 7D). Collectively, these data support the notion that the decreased miR-205 in CAFs increases the expression of YAP1, IL11 and IL15, and promotes tumor angiogenesis to fuel tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis (Figure 7E).DiscussionTumor angiogenesis plays a critical role in tumor development. However, how the activated fibroblasts in human breast tumor microenvironment regulate tumor VEGF-independent angiogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we found that the stromal CAFs are closely involved in tumor angiogenesis in breast tumor, in which the activated fibroblasts can recruit and stimulate vascular endothelial cells to form vascular tubes and sprouts, thus enhancing breast tumor cell growth and metastasis in vivo. The downregulated miR-205 and its target YAP1 activate NFs into CAFs and enhance CAF proliferation and migration activities. Furthermore, these activated CAFs induced by YAP1 cannot promote VEGF, but their IL11 and IL15 expressions stimulate angiogenesis, even under the blockage of VEGF signaling by Axitinib and anti-VEGF antibody, suggesting that CAFs can modulate tumor angiogenesis resistance to anti-VEGF therapy via IL11 and IL15. Collectively, our results provide a novel insight into breast CAFs pro-angiogenesis role in a VEGF-independent manner.In this study, we found that the downregulated stromal miR-205 plays a key role in the activation of stromal fibroblasts, thus enhancing angiogenesis. Our findings support that the dysregulated miRNAs are involved in multiple CAF-driven tumor biological processes. For example, downregulation of miR-31 and miR-21 in ovarian CAFs, and miR-15 and miR-16 in prostate CAFs have been shown to promote tumor migration and invasion through reprogrammed CAFs. Furthermore, the downregulated miR-320 in mammary fibroblasts induces oncogenic secretome, which in turn promotes tumor angiogenesis and tumor invasion.Our studies disclose that YAP1, a target of miR-205 in breast CAFs, functions as a critical regulator in activated CAF-mediated tumor angiogenesis. YAP1, the nuclear co-transcriptional factor of the Hippo pathway, has been reported to govern organ size and stem cell differentiation in embryonic development. YAP1 is also recognized as a functional mediator in lung fibroblast differentiation and fibrogenesis. In addition, the oncogenic YAP1 in ovarian cancer promotes tumor cell growth and metastasis, resulting in a poor survival for tumor patients. Here, we found that miR-205 targets YAP1 in CAFs to promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast tumor tissues. Although a high level of VEGF was detected in breast CAFs, YAP1 does not regulate VEGF expression. Furthermore, inhibition of VEGF signaling can't block YAP1-mediated pro-angiogenesis. Similarly, high level of YAP1 has been found in human cholangiocarcinoma to promote angiogenesis by regulating NFAP5 expression. These findings support that YAP1 induces a VEGF-independent pro-angiogenic signature in tumor angiogenesis.Our studies prove that inflammatory factor IL11 and IL15, aside from previously reported FGF2 and SDF1, are novel pro-angiogenic factors regulated by YAP1 in breast stromal CAFs. Previous studies proved that IL11 and IL15 are the cytokines with biological activities towards T-cells. IL15 secreted from uterine nature killer cells induce angiogenesis in endometrium. IL11 and IL15 were then found to have metastatic potential in colorectal cancer cells and act as a chemoresistant factor in lung adenocarcinoma. IL11 or IL15 also have the capacity to promote proliferation of cancer cells. Here, we confirmed that IL11 and IL15 in stromal CAFs, directly regulated by YAP1, act as powerful mediators between CAFs and breast cancer cells to facilitate tumor angiogenesis. The aberrant YAP1 induced by miR-205 in stromal CAFs enhances IL11 and IL15 expressions, but not the known pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, SDF, FGFs, or PDGF, to stimulate the STAT3 activation and promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs. Application of Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody alone in either the co-culture system of HUVECs and CM derived from CAF, or in tumor-burdened mice in vivo, resulted in vascular endothelial cells retaining their angiogenic properties. Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody combination with siRNA against IL11 and IL15 in CAFs severely blunted tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs. Moreover, IL11 and IL15 from breast CAFs can activate STAT3 in HUVECs. This is in line with the previous findings by Tao and Angiolillo. These findings suggest a complicated VEGF-dependent and VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast stromal CAFs.Our findings support that VEGF-independent angiogenesis is pivotal to clinical tumor therapy. Tumor resistance to anti-VEGF therapy and sustained tumor angiogenesis might occur in a VEGF-independent manner. Excluding tumor cells themselves, various stromal cells contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF signaling, ultimately promoting tumor progression. For example, CD11b+Gr1+ cells, initiated by G-CSF, mediate tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF therapy. CAFs have been confirmed to be involved in resistance to anti-VEGF treatment. For example, TAFs isolated from invasive breast cancer secrete SDF-1 to recruit hematopoietic cells, or anti-VEGFA refractory subcutaneous tumor produces abundant PDGF-C to maintain tumor angiogenesis. Here, we prove that IL11 and IL15 are novel pro-angiogenic factors in breast CAF. Particularly, the angiogenic factors IL11 and IL15 derived from CAFs are regulated by miR-205/YAP1, which is not affected by the different types of control vectors, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of fibroblasts during preparation of CM. Thus, miR-205/YAP1/IL11/IL15 signaling axis, a VEGF-independent signaling in breast stromal CAFs, plays a specific role to tumor angiogenesis. However, the combined targeting YAP1 and VEGF did not completely block angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting additional mechanisms involved in VEGF-independent angiogenesis.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that activated CAFs promote VEGF-independent proangiogenic processes in the breast tumor microenvironment. Secretion of IL11 and IL15 governed by miR-205/YAP1 signaling in CAFs specifically stimulates STAT3 signaling in vascular endothelial cells, contributing to tumor angiogenesis and resistance to anti-VEGF, thus triggering tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer.Supplementary MaterialAbbreviationsCAFcancer associated-fibroblastmiR-205micoRNA-205YAP1Yes-associated protein 1VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor AIL11interleukin 11IL15interleukin 15NFnormal fibroblastHUVECsHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial CellsSTAT3signal transducer and activator of transcription 3VEGFRvascular endothelial growth factor receptorFDAFood and Drug AdministrationDLL4delta like canonical Notch ligand 4NRP1neuropilin 1ABL1ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinaseFGFfibroblast growth factorPDGFplatelet derived growth factorTAMsTumor-associated macrophagesTGFtransforming growth factorSDF1stromal cell-derived factor 1G-CSFcolony stimulating factor 3ECMExtracellular matrixCSCscancer stem cellsMFAP5microfibril associated protein 5Hhour\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinCK8+18cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18CD31Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)LVlentivirusshRNAshort hairpin RNAsiRNAsmall interfering RNAMVDmicrovessel densityIHCimmunohistochemistryIFimmunofluorescenceFNfibronectinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateqRT-PCRquantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionCMconditioned mediumELISAenzyme-linked immuno sorbent assayTCGAThe Cancer Genome AtlasDCIScarcinoma in situIDCinvasive ductal carcinomaHNRNPKheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein KSLC4A4solute carrier family 4 member 4CtrlcontrolCMCcarboxymethylcelluloseSalsaline.Role of angiogenesis in human tumor dormancy: animal models of the angiogenic switchMigration and proliferation of endothelial cells in preformed and newly formed blood vessels during tumor angiogenesisVEGF and the quest for tumour angiogenesis factorsImaging key biomarkers of tumor angiogenesisVEGFA and tumour angiogenesisRecent molecular discoveries in angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapies in cancerLimited Tumor Tissue Drug Penetration Contributes to Primary Resistance against Angiogenesis InhibitorsIn the end what matters most?

        "content": "Tumor-derived matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin-C (TN-C) have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of how these proteins contribute to tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Importantly, these matricellular proteins are known to interact with \u03b19\u03b21 integrin. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor-derived \u03b19\u03b21 integrin may contribute to tumor progression. To clarify the roles of \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis, we used an inhibitory anti-human \u03b19\u03b21 integrin antibody (anti-h\u03b19\u03b21 antibody) and a \u03b19\u03b21 integrin-positive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo orthotopic xenotransplantation model. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor, but not host \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, contributes to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and host-derived OPN production. We also found that CAFs contributed to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and host-derived OPN levels. Consistent with those findings, tumor volume was well-correlated with numbers of CAFs and levels of host-derived OPN. Furthermore, it was shown that the inoculation of D3H2LN cells into mammary fat pads with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), obtained from wild type, but not OPN knock-out mice, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth, thus indicating that CAF-derived OPN enhanced tumor growth. These results suggested that tumor \u03b19\u03b21-mediated signaling plays a pivotal role in generating unique primary tumor tissue microenvironments, which favor lymphatic metastasis and tumor growth. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes lymphatic metastasis through enhancing invasion. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes tumor growth through CAFs. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin enhances the recruitment of CAFs into the primary tumor. Tumor cells induce the production of OPN by CAFs in the primary tumor. CAF-derived OPN promotes tumor growth.",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells.

(f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min. Upper panels, representative images of adherent cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panel, adhesion was quantified at 570\u2009nm.

(B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm).

(C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay. Left panels, representative images of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 wound healing over time (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a016\u2009h) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm.

MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay.

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "Some epithelial cancers can be induced to revert to quiescent differentiated tissue when combined with embryonic mesenchyme; however, the mechanism of this induction is unknown. Here we combine tissue engineering, developmental biology, biochemistry and proteomics approaches to attack this problem. Using a synthetic reconstitution system, we show that co-culture of breast cancer cells with embryonic mesenchyme from early stage (E12.5-13.5) mammary glands decreases tumor cell proliferation while stimulating acinus differentiation, whereas cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) fail to produce these normalizing effects. When insoluble extracellular matrices (ECMs) were isolated from cultured early stage (E12.5-13.5) embryonic mammary mesenchyme cells or E10 tooth mesenchyme and recombined with mammary tumor cells, they were found to be sufficient to induce breast cancer normalization including enhanced expression of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1). In contrast, ECM from later stage (E14.5) mammary mesenchyme and conditioned medium isolated from mesenchymal cell cultures were ineffective. Importantly, when the inductive ECMs produced by early stage embryonic mammary mesenchyme were scraped from dishes and injected into fast-growing breast tumors in mice, they significantly inhibited cancer expansion. Proteomics analysis of the detergent insoluble ECM material revealed several matrix components that were preferentially expressed in the embryonic ECMs. Analysis of two of these molecules previously implicated in cancer regulation--biglycan and tenascin C--revealed that addition of biglyan can mimic the tumor normalization response, and that siRNA knockdown of its expression in cultured embryonic mesenchyme results in loss of the ECM's inductive activity. These studies confirm that embryonic mesenchyme retains the ability to induce partial breast cancer reversion, and that its inductive capability resides at least in part in the ECM protein biglycan that it produces.",

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative RFSThe median RFS in CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively. The median RFS in CAF PD-L1-negative patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 47, 53, and 49\u2009months, respectively. CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N did not correlate with RFS (p\u2009=\u20090.058, 0.788, and 0.411, respectively).Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative OSKaplan\u2013Meier curves for the overall survival (OS) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. a OS curves in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the 73\u201310 assay. b OS curves in CAF PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the SP142 assay. c OS curves in CAF PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the E1L3N assayFigure\u00a05 shows the OS curves of CAF PD-L1-positive and -negative patients evaluated using 73\u201310 (Fig.\u00a05a), SP-142 (Fig. 5b), and E1L3N (Fig. 5c), respectively. The median OS of CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

In this study, we assessed the effect of media conditioned by MRC-5 fibroblasts or MCF-7/6 breast cancer cells on cathepsin D (CD) production and secretion by these two cell types. We also considered the influence of estrogens and matrix components (type I or type IV collagen, or Matrigel) on the expression and activity of CD produced by breast cancer cells of different invasive potentials (MCF-7/AZ, MCF-7/6, MDA-MB-231). In our system, fibroblasts conditioned medium does not significantly affect CD levels produced and secreted by the MCF-7/6 cells. However, we found that fibroblasts are able to capture the pro-CD secreted by these tumor cells by a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent process. We also found a positive correlation between the proportion of extracellular CD levels and the invasive potentials of the tumor cell types considered. If estrogens are able to upregulate CD production and secretion by receptor-positive cells, it is not the case of extracellular matrix components. On the other hand, our results indicate that matrix components are able to influence the distribution of the different CD forms in and out of the cells. Our data suggest that tumor fibroblasts, by enhancing their intracellular CD levels, could assist cancer cells in the digestion of extracellular matrix during the invasion of tissues.",

Increasing evidence suggests that activated stroma is a prerequisite for tumor formation, the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ to the invasive stage, and the metastatic process. However, stromal cells have been revealed to inhibit the early stages of tumor progression, but to promote progression at the later stages. Importantly, the tumor:stroma ratio and the stroma type in primary breast cancer have been reported to be associated with patient survival including recurrence, distant metastasis, and death.The cancer stroma is composed of diverse cell types including endothelial cells, immune cells, and fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cell type in breast cancer. Considering that \u2018tumors are wounds that do not heal\u2019, \u223c80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma share some similarities, such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression, with myofibroblasts being activated during wound healing. These fibroblasts acquire an aggressive phenotype and contribute to tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis directly or indirectly by paracrine action of various growth factors, cytokines, proteases, and hormones including estrogens. Accordingly, these activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma are designated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and are recognized as co-mediators of tumor progression rather than as merely bystanders.Estrogen is well recognized as a mitogen for breast cancer cells. Traditionally, estrogenic effects have been ascribed to the nuclear estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) that function as transcription factors binding to the regulatory response elements in the promoters of target genes. However, estrogen also triggers rapid cellular events that are independent of transcriptional activity. At present, the third ER, estrogen (G-protein-coupled) receptor (GPER) (also referred as GPR30), is largely accepted as the mediator of these \u2018rapid\u2019, \u2018nongenomic\u2019 effects. GPER was identified in the late 1990s as a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), belonging to a superfamily of membrane receptors traditionally recognized to mediate rapid signaling by modulating second messengers and kinase pathways. In 2000, the 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-triggered rapid activation of ERK1/2 in breast cancer cells was found to correlate with GPER (GPER1) expression by. In 2002, the same group reported that GPER mediated the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the MAPK signaling axis in response to E2. In addition, GPER was reported to be associated with the modulation of calcium (Ca2+), cAMP, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the subsequent years. Although the transcriptional effect of estrogen is almost exclusively correlated with ER\u03b1, GPER-triggered rapid signaling events have also been observed to regulate gene expression. Multiple genes, such as FOS, BCL2, cyclin D1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and early growth response 1 (EGR1), have been included in the GPER-targeted gene list. Accordingly, GPER has been shown to be involved in the proliferation, migration, chemoresistance, and metastasis of breast cancer.Estrogen plays a critical role in the development and cyclic regulation of the mammary gland, which is composed not only of epithelium but also of stroma. This raises the logical question of whether estrogen affects breast-cancer-associated stroma. Intriguingly, accumulating evidence related to GPER expression and its proliferative role in breast CAFs has been reported. revealed that GPER is exclusively expressed as an ER in mammary CAFs and induces the expression of C-FOS, cyclin D1, and CTGF in response to E2, confirmed at both the mRNA and the protein level, resulting in the promotion of proliferation. GPER has also been shown to be involved in the growth and migration stimulated by E2, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and bisphenol A in breast CAFs. Thus, it can be proposed that estrogen, as an important factor in the breast cancer local microenvironment, is involved in cancer progression in a GPER-mediated CAF-dependent model.Interestingly, tamoxifen (TAM), a selective ER modulator (SERM) targeting ER\u03b1, and its metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen have been recognized as agonists of GPER, indicating a potential role of GPER in breast cancer TAM resistance. In clinical specimens, the co-expression of ER\u03b1 (ESR1) and GPER has been found in \u223c40% of the primary breast cancer cases and GPER expression, as an independent unfavorable factor, has been found to correlate with relapse-free survival in patients treated with TAM. In vitro, TAM has been reported to enhance proliferation via sensitivity-enhanced GPER/EGFR/MAPK signaling in TAM-resistant MCF-7 cells, and knockdown of GPR30 in MCF-7 cells has been shown to decrease the proliferation of cells exposed to TAM. Furthermore, a TAM analog has been demonstrated to promote endometrial cell proliferation and aromatase gene expression, implying that GPER plays a positive role in estrogen production.In the present study, we demonstrated that GPER is expressed in the stromal fibroblasts of primary breast cancer tissues and CAFs isolated from tumor tissues. E2, the GPER agonist G1 (1-(4-(6-bromobenzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl)-ethanone, 1-[(3aS,4R,9bR-rel)-4-(6-bromo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl]-ethanone), and TAM activated GPER in breast CAFs and promoted proliferation and cell-cycle progression via the GPER/EGFR/ERK axis. Moreover, TAM and G1 induced CYP19A1 gene expression and increased E2 production, also via the GPER/EGFR/ERK pathway, providing novel insights into the estrogenic effects on the breast cancer microenvironment and the induction of TAM resistance in a CAF-dependent manner.Subjects and methodsChemicalsE2, TAM, the GPER agonist G1, and the GPER antagonist G15 (4-(6-bromo-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. The EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (AG), the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, and the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (WM) were purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA, USA). All chemicals were solubilized in DMSO.Clinical specimensA total of 141 archival paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed breast tumor tissue samples were obtained from the Clinical Diagnostic Pathology Center of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China). All patients had undergone surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University during the period ranging from January 2009 to December 2010. The samples of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemical assays for ER\u03b1, progestin receptor, and human EGFR2 by the same center. The investigation was approved by the ethics committee of Chongqing Medical University.ImmunohistochemistryCommercial rabbit anti-GPER polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was used in immunohistochemical staining as described previously. Briefly, tissue samples were deparaffinized and heated at 95\u200a\u00b0C in 0.1\u200amol/l sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for antigen recovery, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H2O2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in 5% goat serum solution for 30\u200amin at 37\u200a\u00b0C. Slides were exposed to primary antibody (1:200) for 2\u200ah at 37\u200a\u00b0C. Sections were incubated in HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 20\u200amin at 37\u200a\u00b0C. Diaminobenzidine was added as a substrate. Nuclei were counterstained using Mayer's modified hematoxylin.GPER expression in stromal fibroblasts and epithelium was evaluated separately. A specimen was considered to be GPER-positive when distinct staining of at least 10% of the stromal fibroblasts was observed. GPER expression in tumor cells was evaluated as described previously.Isolation, identification, and immortality of mammary fibroblasts and cell cultureFibroblasts were isolated as described previously. Briefly, tumor tissue samples and coupled grossly normal breast tissue samples (at least 2\u200acm from the tumor margin) resected during surgery were washed with sterile PBS containing antibiotics (100\u200aU/ml penicillin, 100\u200a\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 50\u200a\u03bcg/ml gentamicin) and were then minced with scissors in a culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (Sigma) at 37\u200a\u00b0C for 8\u201312\u200ah, the suspensions were carefully pipetted up and down in the culture medium. The suspensions were centrifuged (1200\u200ag for 5\u200amin) and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. The suspension was maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for \u223c2 days to allow cell attachment. The most adherent cells (fibroblasts) were further maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The investigation was approved by the Local Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from the patients.CAFs were identified by immunostaining for \u03b1-SMA and fibroblast active protein (FAP), as well as by evaluation of cell morphology. Fibroblast populations with CAF purity exceeding 85% were used as CAFs in related experiments. The primary CAFs were then immortalized with the human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT; from AddGene, Cambridge, MA, USA) for subsequent experiments. MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM with phenol red, supplemented with 10% FBS.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescent staining was utilized to identify CAFs and ER expression following a previously described protocol. Briefly, 105 cells were grown on coverslips for 24\u200ah and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% goat serum. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4\u200a\u00b0C with primary antibodies targeting \u03b1-SMA, FAP, and GPER (Abcam) and ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China); all dilutions were 1:150. After washing with PBS, the cells were stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100; Zhongshan Golden Bridge, Beijing, China) for 10\u200amin and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5\u200amin. Immunofluorescent images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Tokyo, Japan).Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ mobilizationChanges in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization were measured using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe Fluo-3/AM (1-[2-Amino-5-(2,7-dichloro-6-hydroxy-3-oxo-9-xanthenyl)phenoxy]-2-(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid, pentaacetoxymethyl ester) (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China). Cells were seeded in 35\u200amm dishes for attachment in normal medium for 24\u200ah. For labeling intracellular Ca2+, the cells were incubated in 500\u200a\u03bcl DMEM with 2.5\u200aM Fluo-3/AM at 37\u200a\u00b0C in the dark for 1\u200ah. The cells were then washed and stored in phenol-free DMEM without Fluo-3/AM for 30\u200amin at 37\u200a\u00b0C. Fluorescence (excitation 488\u200anm and emission 543\u200anm) was determined using a Leica TCS SP2-laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Mannheim, Germany). Scanning was performed every 3\u200as and baseline fluorescence was recorded for 15\u200as. The test compounds diluted in assay buffer were then added, and fluorescence intensity was monitored for 150\u200as. Data were quantified and analyzed using Image J Software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Background fluorescence was subtracted, and fluorescence intensity is expressed relative to baseline values.Dynamic monitoring of GPCR activationThe cellular response to GPCR stimulation was monitored using an RTCA DP instrument (xCELLigence system, Roche). The RTCA DP Station was maintained in a humidified cell-culture incubator under normal culture conditions throughout the experiments. Background impedance was measured with 100\u200a\u03bcl of cell-culture medium/well. CAFs (2.0\u00d7104/well) were plated, and the final volume of the cell-culture medium was adjusted to 200\u200a\u03bcl/well. To allow equal distribution of cells, E-Plates 16 containing cells were pre-incubated for 30\u200amin at room temperature. Subsequently, the plates were transferred to the RTCA DP Station inside the incubator and cultured overnight. Impedance was routinely recorded at 15-min intervals to monitor cell-culture conditions. After the administration of GPCR agonists, impedance was monitored at intervals of 1\u20133\u200amin for at least 2\u200ah. Results are expressed as cell index normalized to the time point of compound administration.siRNA transfectionCAFs (4\u00d7105) were seeded into 25\u200acm2 culture flasks in 2\u200aml of growth medium and grown to 80% confluence before transfection. GPER-specific siRNA (siGPER) or nonspecific control siRNA (scrambled siRNA) (Genechem, Shanghai, China) were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. The target sequences for GPR30 siRNA were 5\u2032-GCUGUACAUUGAGCAGAAATT-3\u2032 (A) and 5\u2032-UUUCUGCUCAAUGUACAGCTT-3\u2032 (B). The control siRNA sequence that did not match any known human cDNA was 5\u2032-AAGGTGTCAGAAACTGACGAT-3\u2032. GPER protein expression was analyzed by western blotting after transfection.Real-time RT-PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the RT2 First Strand Kit and MMLV-RT (Takara, Dalian, China). The cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR amplification using gene-specific primers and 2\u00d7 Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA, USA) as described previously. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Specific gene expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method with GAPDH as the calibrator.Proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates (5\u00d7103 cells/well) and cultured for 24\u200ah in normal growth medium. The medium was then replaced with phenol red-free and serum-free medium (DMEM; Gibco), and the cells were cultured for a further 24\u200ah before the addition of E2, G1, or TAM with or without G15, AG, U0126, and WM pretreatment at the designated concentration. The cells were further cultured in phenol red-free DMEM containing 2.5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS. Cell viability was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Beyotime) after 72\u200ah.Cell-cycle assayCells were seeded in six-well plates (2\u00d7105 cells/well) and cultured for 24\u200ah. Cell growth was synchronized in phenol red-free and serum-free medium for 24\u200ah before the addition of E2, G1, or TAM with or without G15, AG, U0126, and WM pretreatment at the designated concentration for 24\u200ah. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously. Briefly, treated cells were harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol at 4\u200a\u00b0C for 1\u200ah and then resuspended in 1\u200aml PBS containing propidium iodide (PI; 50\u200a\u03bcg/ml) and RNase A (0.1\u200amg/ml) and incubated at 37\u200a\u00b0C for 30\u200amin. Finally, the cells (105 cells/analysis) were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSVantage SE, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and cell-cycle distribution was determined by PI staining of DNA content.ImmunoblottingCells were stimulated with E2, G1, or TAM for 15\u200amin with or without G15, AG, U0126, and WM pretreatment. Western blotting was then performed as described previously. Briefly, cell lysates were harvested in a cell lysis buffer (Boster, Wuhan, China), dissolved in 9% SDS\u2013PAGE buffer, and subjected to western blotting using primary detection antibodies against total or phosphorylated ERK1/2 (diluted 1:1000; BioWorld, St Louis Park, MN, USA) and GPER. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u200a\u00b0C before incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was conducted using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Optimal density was analyzed using Image J Software, and results were expressed as fold change relative to the control.E2 production assayCells were seeded in six-well plates (2\u00d7106 cells/well) and cultured to 50% confluence. Testosterone was added at the appropriate concentration. The administration of G1 or TAM was done 1\u200ah later with or without G15, AG, U0126, and WM pretreatment. The cells were cultured for 48\u200ah, and the medium was harvested for E2 detection using the Access E2 Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) in the Endocrinology Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS System 17.0 for Windows. Associations between GPER expression and clinicopathological determinants were evaluated using the \u03c72 test and the Fisher's exact test (for nominal variables) as appropriate. For measurement data, Student's t-test or ANOVAs followed by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison tests were used to evaluate differences between the subgroups. Two-tailed P values \u22640.05 were considered to be statistically significant.ResultsGPER is expressed in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast cancer tissuesAll the 141 tumor samples included in this study were invasive ductal carcinoma samples from patients who had not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The characteristics of patients and tumors are summarized in Table 2. Stromal fibroblasts were identified as large spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells with stress fibers and well-developed fibronexus based on previously reported descriptions. Antibody specificity was validated in SKBr3, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which are known to express GPER at varying levels (Supplementary Fig. 1, see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article). GPER was positively stained in a cytoplasmic pattern, and 59 tumor samples (41.8%) were considered to be stromal fibroblast GPER-positive based on distinct staining of 10% or more of the fibroblasts (Table 2). Two-thirds (66.7%) of the samples exhibited positive tumor cell staining of varying density. Varying degrees of epithelial GPER expression were observed (Fig. 1A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H). However, a significant association was detected between stromal and epithelial GPER expression (data not shown). Interestingly, positive GPER staining was also observed in arterial smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (Fig. 1I and J), which are considered to be the origins of CAFs.Correlations between GPER expression in stromal fibroblasts, as well as in carcinoma cells, and clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer are summarized in Table 2. GPER staining in stromal fibroblasts did not correlate with the determinants analyzed. However, epithelial GPER expression was exclusively associated with ER\u03b1 expression.GPER is expressed in CAFs isolated from primary breast cancer tissuesFibroblasts isolated from primary breast cancer tissues were observed to be myofibroblasts with both a spindle-shaped and a stellate morphology. Mammary CAFs were identified by positive staining for \u03b1-SMA and FAP as described previously (; Fig. 2A).GPER expression was confirmed by immunostaining of primary and immortalized (CAF-hTERT) breast CAFs, using MCF-7 cells as positive controls (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we detected GPER mRNA by real-time RT-PCR in six cases of primary CAFs and immortalized CAFs (Fig. 2B). The level of GPER expression in primary CAFs ranged from 0.08- to 0.98-fold (mean, 0.42-fold) relative to the expression detected in MCF-7 cells. However, GPER expression in CAF-hTERT cells was half (0.49-fold) of that detected in MCF-7 cells. Considering that GPER was identified as a GPCR and overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, GPER expression in breast CAFs was abundant. Notably, the other two ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, were not detected by immunostaining or quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A and B), consistent with a previous report.E2, G1, and TAM stimulate GPER response in breast CAFsE2 and TAM have been recognized as agonists of GPER, while G1 has been identified as a selective agonist. The xCELLigence system has been demonstrated to be reliable and sensitive for the analysis of GPCR activation in living cells. To confirm the effect of E2, G1, and TAM on GPER in breast CAFs, GPCR activation was monitored dynamically using the xCELLigence system following the administration of these agonists. E2, G1, and TAM stimulated transient and dose-dependent cell index increases within 1\u200ah, with peaking being observed at 1.58\u00b10.21, 1.29\u00b10.11, and 1.31\u00b10.09 respectively. These responses were eliminated by pretreatment with the GPER-specific antagonist G15 (Fig. 3A).Ca2+ modulation has been reported to be correlated with GPER stimulation and therefore has been utilized as a sensor of GPER activation in early studies. We monitored intracellular Ca2+ modulation by labeling laser scanning spectral confocal microscopy analysis of the Fluo-3 AM probe in CAFs. Within 30\u200as, E2 (1\u200a\u03bcM), G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM), and TAM (1\u200a\u03bcM) enhanced fluorescence intensity (fold changes: 1.41\u00b10.12, 1.29\u00b10.08, and 1.26\u00b10.09, respectively, relative to the baseline), indicating that these agonists stimulated intracellular Ca2+ modulation. Similarly, G15 pretreatment blocked the effects on intercellular Ca2+ stimulated by E2, G1, and TAM (Fig. 3B).It has been demonstrated that GPER induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to E2 in breast cancer cells. We also observed that E2 (1\u200a\u03bcM), G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM), and TAM (1\u200a\u03bcM) stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (fold changes: 1.82\u00b10.22, 1.60\u00b10.19, and 1.59\u00b10.21, respectively, relative to the control). Moreover, G15 pretreatment inhibited ERK1/2 activation induced by GPER ligands in breast CAFs (Fig. 3C).Although GPER was also detected in fibroblasts isolated from normal breast tissues, no significant effects of E2, G1, and TAM were observed in the aforementioned assays (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3, see section on supplementary data given at the end of this article).E2, G1, and TAM promote GPER-mediated proliferation in breast CAFsThe role of GPER in CAF proliferation was examined by the administration of E2, G1, and TAM, and cell viability was measured after treatment for 3 days. E2, G1, and TAM enhanced the proliferation of breast CAFs after culture for 72\u200ah in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal proliferation of 162.7\u00b112.1, 155.8\u00b16.9, and 136.6\u00b18.5% relative to the control was detected following treatment with E2 (10\u200anM), G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM), and TAM (10\u200anM) respectively (Fig. 4A). G15 abolished these cell proliferative effects (Fig. 4B). To confirm the role of GPER in these proliferative effects further, GPER was knocked down to 39% by specific siRNA transfection of CAFs (CAF-GPERi). Interestingly, none of the ligands stimulated significant proliferative effects in CAF-GPERi cells. Moreover, CAF-GPERi cell numbers were significantly less than CAF-GPER cell numbers following the administration of E2 (10\u200anM), G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM), and TAM (10\u200anM) (Fig. 4B).The GPER-mediated effect on cell-cycle progression was investigated. Mammary CAFs were synchronized by estrogen and serum withdrawal and then treated with E2 (10\u200anM), G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM), and TAM (10\u200anM) for 24\u200ah followed by PI staining and flow cytometry. The administration of E2, G1, and TAM significantly increased the proportion of S-phase CAFs from 13.4\u00b13.2% to 26.9\u00b16.8, 24.7\u00b15.4, and 28.6\u00b14.6%. Importantly, both G15 pretreatment and GPER knockdown blocked the accumulation induced by E2, G1, and TAM (Fig. 4C).GPER/EGFR/ERK pathway is involved in TAM-induced CAF proliferationAs has been mentioned previously, GPER stimulation is involved in the transactivation of EGFR/ERK signaling and PI3K modulation in breast cancer cells. In this study, G15 (selective GPER antagonist), AG, U0126, and WM (inhibitors of EGFR, ERK1/2, and PI3K respectively) were used to evaluate the role of these pathways in GPER-mediated proliferation and cell-cycle changes in breast CAFs. G15, AG, and U0126 significantly inhibited the proliferation induced in CAFs by G1, TAM (Fig. 5A), and E2 (data not shown). WM treatment had no significant influence on CAF proliferation (Fig. 5A). Similar trends were observed for the accumulation of S-phase cells in response to G1, TAM (Fig. 5B), and E2 (data not shown). As a sensor of GPER/EGFR/ERK signaling activation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting. As expected, G15, AG, and U0126 significantly reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by G1, TAM (Fig. 5C), and E2 (data not shown) in CAFs. However, WM treatment had no significant influence on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CAFs (Fig. 5C). Moreover, these GPER ligands did not enhance ERK phosphorylation in CAF-GPERi cells (Fig. 5D).GPER is involved in TAM-induced E2 productionCAFs are known to be an important source of local estrogen in breast cancer. We tested the ability of CAFs to synthesize E2 in vitro. The substrate of E2, testosterone, was added to the CAF culture medium for 48\u200ah before harvesting for E2 detection by chemiluminescence immunoassay. The administration of testosterone stimulated dose-dependent E2 production. Furthermore, at a dose of 10\u200amM testosterone, the S-phase accumulation increased dramatically to 44\u00b15.8% (vs 32.3\u00b14.5% in the control), while the concentration of E2 increased to 1553\u00b1158\u200apg/ml (vs 74\u00b111 in the control) (Fig. 6A).Increasing evidence indicates that GPER is involved in aromatase gene regulation and local estrogen production. We evaluated the potential role of GPER and related signaling in E2 production in the breast microenvironment. Interestingly, GPER activation increased E2 production in breast CAFs. Treatment of CAFs with testosterone (100\u200anM) stimulated the production of 286\u00b136\u200apg/ml (vs 73\u00b114\u200apg/ml in the control) of E2 after cultivation for 48\u200ah. The administration of TAM (10\u200anM) and G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM) further increased the concentration of E2 to 419\u00b160 and 541\u00b169\u200apg/ml respectively. This enhancement was inhibited by GPER knockdown and G15, AG, and U0126 administration but not by WM administration (Fig. 6C). These data were paralleled by the effects of GPER interference and G15, AG, U0126, and WM on cell viability when administered under identical conditions (Fig. 5B). Hence, we attempted to verify whether this phenomenon was caused by GPER-mediated proliferation or GPER-induced aromatase expression in breast CAFs. As expected, culturing with TAM (10\u200anM) and G1 (1\u200a\u03bcM) for 18\u200ah induced CYP19A1 gene expression (fold changes: 3.4\u00b10.6 and 3.8\u00b11.0, respectively, vs the control) in CAFs, and this effect was blocked by GPER interference and G15, AG, and U0126 but not by WM (Fig. 6D).DiscussionEstrogens play an important role in breast cancer development. ER\u03b1 is widely accepted as a target for endocrine therapy of breast cancer, and a well-known SERM, TAM, provides considerable benefits for patients with breast cancer at different stages. However, acquired TAM resistance in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells has become a significant challenge in its clinical application. Recently, TAM resistance has been reported to be correlated with the expression of the novel ER, GPER. In the present study, we demonstrated that GPER is expressed in the stromal fibroblasts of primary breast cancer tissues and CAFs isolated from tumor tissues. TAM, in addition to E2 and the GPER agonist G1, promoted proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and E2 production via the GPER/EGFR/ERK axis in breast CAFs, providing novel insights into the GPER-mediated CAF-dependent mechanism of TAM resistance in breast cancer.GPER was first detected as a GPCR gene in breast cancer cell lines as well as in primary breast cancer in 1997. Subsequently, several examples of GPER expression in breast cancer have been reported. conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of GPER in 361 cases of breast cancer and correlated GPER with the expression of ER\u03b1, the progestin receptor, and human EGFR2 as well as tumor size and the presence of metastasis. However, results obtained in other studies were not consistent with these observations. In the present study, the presence of GPER in cancer cells was exclusively correlated with ER\u03b1 expression (Table 2). Additionally, the co-expression of GPER and ER\u03b1 in carcinoma cells was found in 41.1% of all samples, which is in accordance with previous reports. The presence of ER\u03b1 is considered to be a definite indication for the administration of TAM, which is a well-characterized agonist of GPER. TAM administration has been shown to stimulate GPER in these patients, resulting in proliferative effects. In vitro, TAM has been reported to promote proliferation via sensitivity-enhanced GPER/EGFR/MAPK signaling in TAM-resistant MCF-7 cells. In recent follow-up studies, GPER has been shown to be correlated with reduced relapse-free survival in patients undergoing TAM treatment. These observations implicate GPER in breast carcinoma TAM resistance, although this remains to be confirmed.GPER has been detected in stromal inflammatory cells, myoepithelium, and fibroblasts in addition to tumor cells of primary breast cancer, although an analysis of its expression has not been reported previously. In this study, positive GPER staining was observed in stromal fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and arterial endothelial cells, all of which are recognized as origins of CAFs. Considering the important role of both estrogen and CAFs in breast cancer development, we correlated GPER expression in stromal fibroblasts with the clinicopathological determinants of breast cancer. Although no significant association was found, GPER expression was definitely detected in stromal fibroblasts of 41.8% of the samples (Table 2), implying a GPER-mediated CAF-dependent estrogenic effect in tumor microenvironment.Estrogens play an important role in the development of mammary glands and associated carcinomas. In healthy women, the extracellular matrix of breast tissue, in addition to the mammary epithelial cells, undergoes cyclic changes with each menstrual cycle. Although stromal ER\u03b1 has been demonstrated to be critical for breast development in mice, studies focusing on ERs and estrogen effects in tumor-associated stroma are rare. Recently, GPER has been demonstrated to be a unique ER mediating E2-stimulated proliferation and migration of breast CAFs. Subsequently, GPER/EGFR/ERK signaling has been claimed to upregulate the expression of EGR1, CTGF, C-FOS, and cyclin D1, resulting in proliferation enhancement in mammary CAFs. Interactions between estrogen and growth factors were delineated decades ago. GPER is thought to be largely responsible for this crosstalk, as it has been demonstrated to employ the EGFR/ERK pathway as its predominant signaling pathway, and growth factors including EGF, CTGF, transforming growth factor \u03b1/\u03b2, and insulin-like growth factor have been observed to regulate GPER expression or be regulated by GPER activation. Similarly, we demonstrated in this study that GPER/EGFR/ERK signal transduction mediates E2-induced proliferation in breast CAFs, based on the observation that G1 induced similar proliferative and cell-cycle promotion that was blocked not only by GPER interference but also by G15, AG, and U0126 administration. These observations revealed the CAF-dependent estrogenic effects on breast cancer microenvironment.Interestingly, we demonstrated that TAM also stimulated the proliferation of CAFs via the GPER/EGFR/ERK pathway in this study (Fig. 5), and its metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen has also been shown to promote breast CAF growth in a previous study. Notably, \u223c40% of ER\u03b1-positive tumors expressed GPER in stromal fibroblasts in our study (Table 2). CAFs are promoters of tumor growth; therefore, it can be suggested that the anti-estrogen effect of TAM in tumor cells is negated by TAM-induced proliferation in CAFs, resulting in acquired TAM resistance in these patients. Recently, GPER expression in breast cancer cells has been reported to be correlated with poorer relapse-free survival only in patients treated with TAM, but tended to be a favorable factor in patients who did not receive TAM therapy. A potential role for GPER expression in CAFs in this bidirectional effects is indicated by the detection of stromal fibroblast GPER expression in 40% of ER\u03b1-positive tumors in our study. Thus, more follow-up data are required in addition to an analysis of GPER expression in stromal fibroblasts and epithelium as determinants for TAM administration in breast cancer patients.CAFs are an important source of local estrogen, which is an important mediator of breast cancer progression. As a key enzyme involved in estrogen synthesis, aromatase has become a paradigm target of endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients. Intriguingly, GPER has been reported to be correlated with aromatase gene upregulation directly or indirectly in previous studies. An analog and a metabolite of TAM have been demonstrated to promote aromatase gene expression via GPER activation in endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore, genistein, a well-recognized GPER agonist, has been reported to increase breast-cancer-associated aromatase expression and activity in vitro. In the present study, TAM and G1 increased both CYP19A1 mRNA and E2 production in CAFs, and this effect was dependent on GPER/EGFR/ERK pathway signaling. Taken together, these observations indicate that GPER in breast CAFs is involved in the increased local production of E2, thus presenting a feed-forward loop model that has been postulated to contribute to TAM resistance in breast cancer patients.The role of GPER in breast CAFs warrants further investigation following its detection in stromal fibroblasts in breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, we confirmed previous reports that the GPER/EGFR/ERK pathway contributes to the proliferation of breast CAFs. Thus, our data provide new insights into estrogenic effects on tumor microenvironment. More importantly, TAM, which is commonly accepted to be a SERM for breast cancer patients, was shown to stimulate proliferation and E2 production in breast CAFs. Hence, GPER is implicated in TAM resistance in a CAF-dependent manner. As such, GPER expression in stromal fibroblasts would be considered a contra-indicator of TAM application or additional therapy targeting GPER signaling ought to be offered in the future.Supplementary

        "content": "Recently, evidence was obtained that the ability to take up alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP), which is characteristic of fetal cells, may be required both in vivo and in vitro by different types of human and animal tumor cells via expression of specific alpha-FP receptors. Mammary gland carcinomas belong to this class of tumor. In some neoplasms, expression of alpha-FP receptors is concomitant with activation of the alpha-FP gene and synthesis of the protein, suggesting that an autocrine alpha-FP/alpha-FP-receptor pathway is operational in these tumors. In the present work, 18 human breast cancer biopsy specimens were subjected to in situ hybridization with a human alpha-FP cDNA probe. Positive labeling for alpha-FP mRNA transcripts was seen in 8 of the specimens. Surprisingly, strong positive signals were seen in stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes infiltrating tumor nests and in adipocytes adjacent to tumor areas, while the malignant cells themselves were hardly labeled. This suggest paracrine stimulation of the alpha-FP gene, probably as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Pathological implications arise from the ability of alpha-FP to regulate growth, either alone or synergistically with other growth factors, as well as its ability to enhance fatty acid entry into proliferating cells.",

        "full_text": "Virus Elimination by Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents Impacts Glucose Homeostasis in Chronic Hepatitis C PatientsBackground and AimsChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, including insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. However, independent risk factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients have not been detailly elucidated. Previous data regarding the impact of HCV elimination by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) on glucose homeostasis is insufficient and controversial. This study aimed to analyze the independent factors associated with IR and to evaluate the changes in glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV-infected patients treated with DAAs therapies.MethodsWe screened 704 patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with interferon-free DAAs. Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics, biochemical and virological data were collected. The outcome measurements were their IR and \u03b2-cell function assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment.ResultsHigh IR (HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5) was observed in 35.1% of the patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2, treatment experience, elevated baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglyceride, as well as Fibrosis-4 score >3.25 were independently associated with high IR. In patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR), no significant change in mean HOMA-IR was observed from baseline to 12-weeks post-treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.128). We observed a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress from 121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6 \u00b1 93.0 (p = 0.015). Subgroup analysis revealed that SVR was associated with a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001), HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027), and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039).ConclusionsThere were several independent factors associated with IR in patients with chronic HCV infection, including obesity, treatment experience, high serum ALT and triglyceride levels, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis. After viral elimination by DAAs, we observed a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline high IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.IntroductionChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also associated with multiple extrahepatic complications that influence the clinical outcomes of patients. An important extrahepatic manifestation is abnormal glucose metabolism including insulin resistance (IR), \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (DM). A prospective study showed that patients with chronic HCV infection were more than 11 times as likely as those without HCV infection to develop diabetes. A meta-analysis revealed a 1.8-fold higher risk of type 2 DM in HCV-infected patients than in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive/HCV-negative patients. Additionally, glucose abnormalities can worsen hepatic outcomes in HCV-infected patients. IR promotes the progression of hepatic fibrosis. This may be due to the direct effect of insulin on the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells and secretion of extracellular matrix. Further, high glucose levels and hyperinsulinemia can lead to upregulation of connective growth factor that is involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. In HCV-related chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes and IR are independently associated with rapid progression of liver fibrosis and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the elevated rate of hepatic morbidity and mortality.The mechanisms underlying HCV-induced IR and DM are complex and poorly explained. The HCV genome is composed of structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS2-NS5B) genes. The complex effects of HCV core and nonstructural 5A (NS5A) proteins have been observed to play important roles in glucose metabolism. In normal circumstances, when insulin attaches to the hepatocyte receptor, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is phosphorylated and then causes activation of Akt. The activated Akt causes the translocation of glucose transporter-4 to the surface of the hepatocyte and facilitates glucose entry into the hepatocyte. Akt also induces the synthesis of glycogen and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The HCV core protein impairs insulin signaling via several post-receptor mechanisms, including the activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members and consequent decrease in IRS-1. The core protein also increases phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine rather than tyrosine in hepatocytes, again preventing the downstream activation of Akt. HCV NS5A upregulates protein phosphatase 2A and inactivates Akt, which reduces the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT2, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake in the hepatocytes, and thus, induces IR. Additionally, HCV protein increases oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, resulting in systemic effect including hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglycemia, and down-regulation of adiponectin. Epidemiological data suggest that all the major HCV genotypes lead to IR. Some viral-specific factors that influence glucose metabolism have also been discussed. Molecular evidence suggests that HCV core proteins in genotypes 3a and 1b promote IRS-1 degradation via different mechanisms. IR was clinically found to be associated with HCV genotype 1 and a high viral load, although the results were inconsistent.Elimination of HCV by interferon (IFN)-based regimen may perturb glucose homeostasis. Previous observational studies have shown that successful eradication of HCV improves IR in patients receiving IFN-based therapy. The \u03b2-cell hyperfunction is also ameliorated after antiviral treatment. Therefore, elimination or suppression of HCV can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, a few studies revealed no change in fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) after antiviral treatment. The results of these studies are inconsistent, but they indicate that the benefits of glucose metabolism may also be HCV genotype specific.Treatment has dramatically improved in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These modern drugs have extremely high treatment efficacy, safety, and less adverse events. These new medications have a higher rate of viral clearance than IFN-based therapy but lack the direct effect of IFN on glucose metabolism. Moreover, the impact of HCV clearance by DAAs on glucose abnormalities remains to be evaluated.Given the presumption that chronic HCV infection involves the development of IR, we hypothesized that HCV eradication by DAAs treatment could improve IR. The aim of the present study was to explore potential factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients and to assess the impact of HCV elimination on glucose homeostasis in patients who received DAAs therapies.MethodsStudy DesignThis was a single-center, observational study. Chronic HCV-infected patients with DAAs treatment were enrolled. Laboratory data including glucose parameters at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were measured. Several factors associated with baseline high IR were analyzed. Further, we calculated the dynamic changes in IR and \u03b2-cell secretion function in patients whose viruses were successfully eradicated. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study design was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mackay Memorial Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the study participants.PatientsWe enrolled patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with IFN-free DAAs therapy between January 2017 and July 2020. The inclusion criteria were patients (1) aged \u2265 20 years; (2) with detectable HCV viral load in the blood prior to treatment; (3) who agreed to receive laboratory testing at baseline, during antiviral treatment, and at 12 weeks after treatment; and (4) who provided informed consent. Patients were excluded if they: (1) missed regular clinical follow-ups after treatment; (2) had a medical history of DM or used glucose-lowering drugs; (3) died from other etiology during the study period; and (4) had concurrent conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus or HBV coinfection, Wilson\u2019s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Basic patient information, body mass index (BMI), HCV viral loads and genotype, alcohol consumption, and medical history were collected. Patients received different DAAs regimens, including asunaprevir + daclatasvir (2.5%), paritaprevir + ritonavir + ombitasvir + dasabuvir (7.8%), elbasvir + grazoprevir (10.7%), glecaprevir + pibrentasvir (16.6%), and sofosbuvir-based regimens (62.4%). Each patient received one of these DAAs regimens based on the HCV genotype, previous treatment status, presence of cirrhosis, current medications, and comorbidities.Laboratory ExaminationsInfection with chronic HCV was defined as persistent viremia for at least six months before treatment. Serum HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels were quantified using a Roche Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, in which the lowest level of detection was 15 IU/mL. HCV genotyping was performed using primer-specific PCR and direct PCR deep sequencing with an ABI 3730 sequencer. The sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA levels 12 weeks following treatment cessation. Information on the levels of fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, alpha-fetoprotein, white blood cells (WBC), as well as hemoglobin and platelets at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were collected. We used Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index as the non-invasive measurement for hepatic fibrosis. The FIB-4 index was calculated using the following formula: (AST [IU/L] \u00d7 age [years])/(platelet count [109/L] \u00d7 ALT [IU/L]1/2).The glucose homeostasis was assessed by the HOMA method. The formulas for the HOMA model are as follows: HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mg/dL) \u00d7 fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL)/405; HOMA-\u03b2 = fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL) \u00d7 360/(fasting glucose [mg/dL]\u201363). We dichotomized patients at a cutoff point of HOMA-IR 2.5 and analyzed factors associated with IR.Statistical AnalysisCategorical data are presented as numbers (percentages) and continuous variables are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance of the difference between categorical variables was determined using the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test depending on the sample size; continuous variables were compared using Student\u2019s t-test. For continuous variables with wide distribution, we presented data as median (interquartile range) and applied the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the differences. After univariate analysis, we performed multivariable logistic regression modelling to identify factors that were independently associated with baseline high IR. To compare quantitative glucose parameters between baseline and post-treatment, we performed Paired t-test. All statistical analyses were defined as two-sided hypotheses with a significance level defined at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsBaseline CharacteristicsDuring the study period, 704 patients were treated with IFN-free DAAs. We excluded 192 patients with medical history of DM or who used glucose-lowering drugs. Additionally, 65 patients were excluded from the study due to failure of checking insulin levels at either baseline or follow-up (n=34), missing regular follow-up (n=24), and death during treatment (n=7). Finally, we enrolled 447 patients in the study. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, glucose parameters, DAAs regimens, and treatment responses are shown in  Table\u00a01 .

Univariate analysis ( Table\u00a02 ) showed that several factors were significantly associated with high IR, including indigenous race, high BMI (> 25 kg/m2), alcoholism, baseline elevated levels of ALT, alpha-fetoprotein, and triglyceride, as well as hepatic fibrosis (defined as FIB-4 > 3.25). The association between IR and older age was not significant (p=0.073). For virus-specific parameters, HCV genotype 1 and HCV treatment experience were significantly associated with high IR (both p < 0.01). The baseline HCV viral load did not influence IR in our patients (p=0.953).

To analyze the relationship between viral elimination and changes in glucose parameters, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 were considered as continuous variables ( Table\u00a04 ). HOMA-IR did not change significantly from baseline to 12-weeks after treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p = 0.128). There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress (121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6\u00a0\u00b1 93.0, p = 0.015). In patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, we observed a significant improvement in mean IR (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001). Additionally, the subgroup analysis revealed that a statistically significant reduction in mean IR after DAAs therapies was observed in patients with HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027) and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039) ( Figure\u00a01 ). However, in patients with baseline HOMA-IR < 2.5, there was a significant increase in mean IR after HCV eradication. We also analyzed pre- and post-treatment HOMA-IR in patients with different races, BMI, HCV viral loads, baseline laboratory results, and FIB-4 score.

Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR at baseline and 12-weeks after antiviral treatment were measured. In general, there was no significant change in mean HOMA-IR. In subgroup analysis, IR significantly reduced after antiviral treatment in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.DiscussionWe presented an observational analysis of glucose homeostasis in patients with chronic HCV infection and the outcomes of HCV elimination by DAAs therapy. We identified several factors contributing to IR in non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV infection. Obesity, elevated ALT and triglyceride levels, treatment experience, and advanced fibrosis were independently associated with IR. Obesity and metabolic syndrome were generally validated as risk factors for IR. In our result, serum levels of triglyceride, a well-known predictor of type 2 diabetes, were also independently related to IR. HCV NS5A and core proteins are known to directly inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity. The accumulation of hepatic triglycerides reduces insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis, consequently leading to hepatic and peripheral IR. We did not observe any virus-specific effects of IR. Neither HCV genotype nor viral loads were observed to be independent factors for HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5. At the molecular level, the core protein of genotype 3a promotes degradation of IRS-1 via downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) and upregulation of SOCS-7; and the core protein of genotype 1b interferes with the insulin signaling by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin. Previous studies have investigated the association of HCV genotype 1 with IR, but the results were inconsistent. In the present study, we also observed a higher prevalence of IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the statistical power was attenuated in multivariable logistic regression analysis. This could be because that the genotype-specific mechanisms interfering with the insulin signaling pathway only partially influenced systemic IR. The established risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia, remain the major contributors of IR in HCV-infected patients.The multivariable logistic regression analysis in the present study demonstrated that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with IR. These findings were less discussed in previous articles. As explained earlier, the HCV core protein and NS5A have complex effects on the insulin signaling pathway, influence hepatic and systemic glucose homeostasis, and thus, induce IR. We hypothesized that prolonged inflammation resulting from chronic HCV infection is associated with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. A previous history of treatment with IFN-based therapy may imply a longer duration of infection with HCV. Additionally, hepatic fibrosis indirectly supports the probability of a longer inflammation by HCV infection. In HCV-infected liver, inflammation is a key process to drive the fibrogenic response. The immune system secretes proinflammatory cytokines and profibrogenic factors, leading to hepatocellular injury, production of extracellular matrix, proliferation of myofibroblasts, and stimulation of fibrosis. Our finding revealed an association between hepatic fibrosis and IR. It is noteworthy that our result only supported a correlation, not a causal relationship. Advanced liver fibrosis may impair insulin clearance, resulting in elevated serum insulin levels. On the contrary, IR also contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis. The mechanism could be a direct stimulation of liver stellate cells by hyperinsulinemia, resulting in increased production of the connective tissue growth factor and subsequent accumulation of extracellular matrix.We analyzed the outcome of glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs. There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell stress. As mentioned earlier, levels of hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 decrease in HCV-infected patients. Clearance of HCV is accompanied by normalization of hepatic expression of IRS and improved \u03b2-cell function, which then influences glucose homeostasis. The IR remained statistically unchanged after DAAs therapy. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies that observed no difference in HOMA-IR between baseline and post-treatment phases in patients with HCV who underwent treatment. However, this contradicts the hypothesis that IR may be improved after HCV eradication, especially as HCV infection is a risk factor for the development of diabetes. There may be several explanations for the lack of an association between SVR and improvement of IR. The development of IR in HCV-infected patients could be a combination of both host- and virus-mediated pathways. The complex hepatic and non-hepatic mechanisms affecting glucose homeostasis may lead to heterogeneous post-SVR outcomes regarding IR. We performed subgroup analysis for further elucidation of the possible causal relationship. We observed a significant improvement in IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, which indirectly supports that HCV is an important contributor to IR, especially among patients with high-IR status. Additionally, this high-IR status could be reversed after HCV elimination by DAAs. Our subgroup analysis suggested that elimination of HCV genotype 1 was also associated with reduced IR. This relationship was not observed in patients with other genotypes. The result is consistent with previous research, which showed that successful viral clearance was found to be associated with reduced HOMA-IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. The genotype-specific outcome of IR suggested the direct viral effect as an important contributor to glucose abnormalities. In our result, advanced hepatic fibrosis was independently associated with IR. However, we did not observe a significant improvement in IR after HCV eradication in patients with advanced fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a chronic process. Patients who received DAA therapy could have a rapid decrease in inflammation rather than regression of fibrosis. The duration of our study seemed too short for significant hepatocyte remodeling or IR improvement.As discussed above, patients with chronic HCV infection show an increased risk of IR and progression to type 2 DM. There are no definite virus-specific factors associated with the increasing prevalence of IR. Thus, we suggest that all patients with HCV infection be screened for glucose abnormalities. It will help physicians to identify patients who have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and may require active surveillance, as diabetes can also increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the advent of DAAs, we may be able to eradicate HCV with greater certainty and a lower risk of adverse effects. An SVR is generally associated with normalization of liver enzymes, improvement in liver function, as well as regression of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Compared with untreated patients, patients whose HCV was eliminated by DAAs have a significantly lower risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, after successful virus elimination by treatment with DAAs, improvement in IR can be an additional benefit and may reduce diabetes-related morbidities. A prospective study found that HCV eradication by DAAs reduces the incidence of type 2 DM. However, a general worsening of the lipid profile after DAAs was observed. The impact of the balance between improved glucose metabolism and negative changes in lipid profile on the outcome of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk must be determined. A significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events has recently been observed following HCV clearance by DAAs. Further research is required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.This study has some limitations. First, this was an observational, open-label study and had the potential for selection bias. Second, a majority of the patients (98.0%) achieved SVR; therefore, it was impossible to compare glucose outcomes between patients with successful eradication and those with treatment failure. Third, the short-term study failed to demonstrate an improvement in IR; thus, the long-term outcome should be investigated to understand the effect of virus elimination on glucose homeostasis. Finally, we could not clarify the impact of HCV infection duration on IR, and could only demonstrate that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were associated with IR.In conclusion, we showed that obesity, treatment experience, baseline elevated levels of ALT and triglyceride, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with high IR in chronic HCV-infected patients. The prevalence of IR was not influenced by HCV genotypes and viral load. This study provided evidence that HCV-related IR could be partially reversed by HCV eradication, especially in patients with high baseline IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience. Further research for long-term outcomes of glucose homeostasis and diabetes-related morbidities in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs is required.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Mackay Memorial Hospital.

        "content": "Among peritumoral cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major facilitators of tumor progression. This study describes the effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, denoted as Pep 1 and its cyclic derivative Pep 2. In a mouse model of tumor dissemination, using HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, Pep 2 reduced the number and size of lung metastases. Specific binding of fluoresceinated Pep 2 to HT1080 and telomerase immortalised fibroblasts (TIF) cell surfaces was enhanced by \u03b1v overexpression or abolished by excess vitronectin, anti-\u03b1v antibodies or silencing of <iITGAV</i \u03b1v gene, identifying \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. In 3D-organotypic assays, peptide-exposed TIFs and primary CAFs from breast carcinoma patients both exhibited a markedly reduced pro-invasive ability of either HT1080 fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells, respectively. Furthermore, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, were impaired in their ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, exhibiting reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. Finally, peptide exposure of \u03b1v-expressing primary CAFs led to the downregulation of \u03b1-SMA protein and to a dramatic reduction of their pro-invasive capability.

This study describes the effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, denoted as Pep 1 and its cyclic derivative Pep 2. In a mouse model of tumor dissemination, using HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, Pep 2 reduced the number and size of lung metastases. Specific binding of fluoresceinated Pep 2 to HT1080 and telomerase immortalised fibroblasts (TIF) cell surfaces was enhanced by \u03b1v overexpression or abolished by excess vitronectin, anti-\u03b1v antibodies or silencing of ITGAV \u03b1v gene, identifying \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. In 3D-organotypic assays, peptide-exposed TIFs and primary CAFs from breast carcinoma patients both exhibited a markedly reduced pro-invasive ability of either HT1080 fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells, respectively. Furthermore, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, were impaired in their ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, exhibiting reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. Finally, peptide exposure of \u03b1v-expressing primary CAFs led to the downregulation of \u03b1-SMA protein and to a dramatic reduction of their pro-invasive capability. In conclusion, the ability of the novel decapeptides to interfere with tumor cell invasion directly and through the down-modulation of CAF phenotype suggests their use as lead compounds for co-targeting anti-cancer strategies.1. IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

As much as 50% or more of tumor bulk consists of non-parenchymal cells often referred to as the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells, cells of the microvasculature, and fibroblasts. Cells of the tumor parenchyma and stroma engage in extensive cross-talk, and the composition of the stroma and the nature of tumor stromal interactions change over time with tumor progression. Tumor-stroma cross-talk influences tumor growth by regulating angiogenesis, suppressing or subverting host immune responses, modulating extracellular matrix, and secreting signaling molecules which then in turn act on cells to further alter cell physiology and to change the composition of the cellular and acellular tumor microenvironment.Fibroblasts are ubiquitous stromal cells which influence other cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. The response of tumor parenchymal cells to fibroblasts depends on many factors, including the nature and extent of the oncogenic lesions in the tumor cells, and the age and activation state of the fibroblasts.While fibroblasts can have tumor suppressing activity the phenotype of the fibroblast changes to a tumor promoting state as carcinogenesis progresses. This process occurs in two stages, generating first reversibly \u201cprimed\u201d and then irreversibly modified fibroblasts with tumor-promoting properties. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) have properties distinct from normal fibroblasts and actively promote tumorigenesis in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer. Typically CAFs have an activated phenotype, expressing smooth muscle actin and showing increased motility. CAFs secrete tumor promoting effectors such as SDF-1, HGF, and TGF-\u03b2 into the tumor microenvironment, and they overproduce extracellular matrix, which contributes to tumor rigidity and an altered signaling context thus further promoting tumor progression. Thus, the phenotype of local fibroblasts can persistently be altered by complex reciprocal parenchymal-stromal interactions that occur during cancer progression.TGF-\u03b2s are pleiotropic growth factors that play important roles in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. Cells release latent TGF-\u03b2 into the microenvironment that upon activation binds to specific serine-threonine kinase receptors. A heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor and the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor (ALK5) then activates intracellular signaling cascades that include the canonical Smad2/3 signaling path and additional pathways such as TAK1-mediated p38- or JNK signaling. Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been implicated in the carcinogenic process in many organs. In the course of cancer progression, TGF-\u03b2s frequently switch from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoting role. In the embryo, expression of TGF-\u03b2 is frequently seen at sites where critical mesenchymal-epithelial interactions occur, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2s may act as an important messenger between these two compartments. In support of such a role, genetic loss of response to TGF-\u03b2 in fibroblasts is associated with aberrant expression of growth factors and cytokines by the fibroblasts and results in the development of premalignant and malignant lesions in several overlying epithelia in stomach, prostate and breast. However, forced overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 primes fibroblasts to promote the outgrowth of initiated human breast epithelial cells. These genetic approaches imply the existence of very delicately balanced TGF-\u03b2-based homeostatic interactions between fibroblasts and the epithelial parenchyma.When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to CAFs in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. Here, we have asked whether the transient interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can induce phenotypic changes in the tumor cell that then affect its malignant properties. We provide evidence that such an interaction induces the secretion and/or activation of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts, which can enhance the malignant behavior of the tumor cells in vivo.ResultsMedium Conditioned by Cocultures of Fibroblasts and Tumor Cells Induces Cell Scattering in Tumor CellsWe investigated the crosstalk between human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a hereafter referred to as CA1a) and fibroblasts (DF) in a two-dimensional coculture system. Cocultures of CA1a and DF formed an organized structure of tumor cell islets that were surrounded by elongated fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Using CA1a cells and DF that were stably infected to report activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of fluorescent protein, we found that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated in both tumor and stromal cells in the cocultures, as compared to much lower levels of activation in the homotypic cultures (Fig. 1A). This observation suggested that cocultures might exhibit emergent properties that were not present in the homotypic cultures. To address the effect of coculturing on secreted components of the tumor microenvironment, we used conditioned media from 4 d old homotypic cultures or cocultures to stimulate CA1a cells that had not been previously exposed to any conditioned media. In scratch assays medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) significantly accelerated closure of the cell-cleared area as compared to medium conditioned by tumor cells (TuCM), fibroblasts alone (FbCM), or unconditioned control medium (medium) (Fig. 1B,C). A similar result was seen when we treated tumor cells that had been plated as a tight colony and assessed migration of cells out of the colony (dot assay). This assay format more closely mimics the migration of tumor cells out of a tumor into the surrounding environment, and eliminates the wounding aspect of the scratch assay. In dot assays CoCM caused scattering of tumor cells from the edges of the colony, whereas colonies treated with homotypic media retained a defined closed edge (Fig. 1B). While CoCM increased migration of CA1a cells, proliferation of CA1a cells was unaffected by treatment with CM (Fig. S1A). At the cellular level, CoCM caused translocation of E-cadherin to the cytoplasm of CA1a cells whereas E-cadherin remained localized at the cell membrane of CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 1B, D). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts causes secretion of a soluble factor that increases cell scattering and migration of tumor cells.Cocultures of breast cancer cells are well organized and increase motility of tumor cells.\nA.\nUpper panel. Human breast cancer cells (CA1a) and mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) form a well organized 2D coculture where fibroblast streaks surround tumor cell islets. Middle panel. Use of fibroblasts and CA1a cells that report Smad3 dependent TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of RFP and GFP, respectively, demonstrates that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell types is increased in cocultures as compared to the homotypic cultures. Bottom Panel. Outline of the tumor cell and fibroblast compartments of the images shown in the middle panel. B. Medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) as compared to medium from homotypic fibroblast (FbCM) and tumor cell (TuCM) cultures increases cell migration and cell scattering in scratch assays (24 h) and dot assays (4 d), and induces cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin as visualized by confocal microscopy (60 min). C. Influence of CoCM on closure of in vitro wounds (\u201cscratch assay\u201d). Cells were plated to confluence, mitosis inhibited by preincubation with mitomycin, and cells then stimulated with conditioned media. CoCM causes significantly faster closure of scratches as compared to all other conditioned media (scratch width after 24 h, n\u200a=\u200a8 samples/group, ANOVA/Bonferroni; p<0.0001). D. Quantification of E-cadherin related immunofluorescence in CA1a cells treated with CM (Fig. 1B). Membranes and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of membrane and cytoplasmic signal were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p\u200a=\u200a0.0052).Cell Scattering Induced by Coculture Conditioned Medium Depends on Active TGF-\u03b2 Synthesized by FibroblastsCell scattering can be induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, and so we tested the effect of candidate factors in the dot assay. Only TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml, Fig. 2A) but not other growth factors such as EGF (Fig. 2A, 25 ng/ml to 250 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml), HGF (5 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml), latency associated protein (LAP, 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) or activin A (0.1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml), induced scattering of CA1a cells in dot assays. To address whether endogenous TGF-\u03b2 might be the factor in CoCM that induces scattering, we used two different Smad-reporter systems to analyze if CA1a cells respond to TGF-\u03b2 in the CM and to sensitively report on the presence of active TGF-\u03b2 in the conditioned media. CoCM induced higher Smad3- and Smad2-mediated luciferase activity than did TuCM, FbCM, or medium, demonstrating that CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2 increases TGF-\u03b2 signaling in tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, CoCM contained higher levels of active TGF-\u03b2 (194\u00b139 pg/ml) than the other conditioned media (TuCM: 94\u00b16 pg/ml, FbCM: 106\u00b122 pg/ml, medium: 0 pg/ml, Fig. 2C) as assessed by activation of a PAI-luciferase reporter activity in CCL64 cells.TGF-\u03b2 signaling induces scattering of CA1a cells.\nA. Exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and fibroblast-released TGF-\u03b2 induces cell scattering in dot assays. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated over night, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), or vehicle (Control) for 4 d. Use of CoCM that was derived from cocultures of CA1a cells and TGF\u03b21 knockout fibroblasts (CoCM(KO)) did not stimulate cell scattering while conditioned medium from cocultures employing TGF-\u03b21 wildtype fibroblasts (CoCM(WT)) did induce cell scattering. B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces higher levels of CAGA (Smad3) and ARE (Smad2) mediated luciferase activity in CA1a cells (n\u200a=\u200a3, ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison, p\u200a=\u200a0.0002 (ARE) and p<0.0001 (CAGA)). C. CoCM contains higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 than TuCM and FbCM. CCL-64 cells were stimulated with CM overnight and PAI-driven luciferase activity was measured. D. Scattering of CA1a cells is induced by addition of 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 to medium. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated overnight, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (0.2 ng/ml) or vehicle for 4 d.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 can induce scattering of CA1a cells in concentrations similar to those secreted by cocultures into the CoCM. To do this we stimulated CA1a with medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 and observed that that this low level of TGF-\u03b2 was sufficient to induce tumor cell scattering (Fig. 2D). Likewise, Smad3 driven GFP expression of the CAGA\u223cGFP reporter was increased by stimulation of CA1a cells with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. S2A). These results indicate that the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 that is secreted by cocultures into the culture medium (CoCM) is sufficient to stimulate cell scattering of CA1a cells.To ask whether this effect was limited to CA1a cells or was more universal we stimulated MCF-7 cells and T47D cells which form adherent cell colonies in culture with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 or CoCM. Both, 0.2 ng/ml exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and CoCM, were capable of inducing scattering of MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. S3), indicating that low concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 as found in CoCM can increase motility of several breast cancer cell lines.Since tumor cells as well as fibroblasts can secrete TGF-\u03b2, we went on to identify the source of TGF-\u03b2 in our coculture system. While medium obtained from cocultures of CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice stimulated scattering of CA1a cells, coculture medium from CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from TGF-\u03b21-null mice did not induce scattering of CA1a cells (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts induces production or activation of TGF-\u03b21 by fibroblasts that then stimulates scattering of the tumor cells.CoCM Stimulates Canonical and Noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 Signaling in CA1a CellsThe TGF-\u03b2 signaling network includes canonical signaling via Smad2/3 as well as non-canonical signaling cascades. Non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling via MAPK pathways can be mediated by TAK1 that then activates JNK- and p38-signaling (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis showed that Smad2, Smad3 and TAK1 were phosphorylated to a greater extent by stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM than by stimulation with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 3A), indicating activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM. On a cellular level, CoCM induced nuclear translocation of Smad2/3in CA1a cells as demonstrated by immunostaining (Fig. 3B,C). This and the induction of Smad2 and Smad3 dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B) further demonstrate that CoCM activates canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells. Similarly, immunofluorescence showed significantly increased levels of proteins of the p38 signaling cascade (phospho-p38, phospho-ATF-2, and phospho-MAPKAPK2) and of phospho-JNK in CA1a cells stimulated with CoCM as compared to CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 4A,B). These data demonstrate that canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are activated upon stimulation of CA1a with CoCM.CoCM activates Smad2/3-signaling and the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK in CA1a cells suggesting activation of canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2.\nA. TGF-\u03b2 activates canonical signaling via Smad2/3 and non-canonical signaling via TAK-1 relayed JNK- and p38 signaling cascades. CoCM stimulated both, phosphorylation of TAK1, and phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3. Cells were incubated with CoCM for 30 min (pTAK1) or 60 min (pSmad2, pSmad3). B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces nuclear localization of Smad2/3 within 60 min, indicating activation of canonical Smad signaling upon stimulation with CoCM. C. Quantification of Smad2/3 mediated immunofluorescence in CM treated CA1a cells (Fig. 2B). Nuclei and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001, n\u200a=\u200anumber of cells analyzed).CoCM activates the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK signaling in CA1a.\nA. Stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM as compared to FbCM and TuCM for 60 min increases levels of phospho-p38 (pp38), pATF-2, pMAPKAPK-2, and pJNK as visualized by fluorescence microscopy, indicating that CoCM activates these non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades. For quantification of pp38-, pATF-2-, pMAPKAPK2- and pJNK mediated immunofluorescence cells were gated and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001 [pp38], p<0.0001 [pATF-2], p<0.0001 [pMAPKAPK2], p<0.00001 [pJNK]). 30 to 40 cells were analyzed per group. B. Inhibitors were added to cultures 30 min prior to stimulating CA1a cells with CoCM for 60 min. E-cadherin was visualized by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. For quantification of E-cadherin mediated the cell membrane and the cytoplasm were gated for each cell and average signal intensities were determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnetts's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001. n \u200a=\u200a number of cells analyzed in each group.Likewise, medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 induced increased levels of pSmad2, pTAK1, MKK3/6, pJNK, pp38, pATF-2, and pMAPKAPK2 in Western blotting (Fig. S2B), indicating that the TGF-\u03b2 concentration that is found in CoCM (0.2 ng/ml) can not only stimulate cell scattering (Fig. 2D), but also is sufficient to activate canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades in CA1a cells.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling is necessary for CoCM induced cell scattering and blocked ALK5, JNK, and p38 signaling during stimulation of CA1a with CoCM. The ALK5 inhibitor SB431542, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4B) all abolished tumor cell scattering induced by CoCM. On a cellular level, those same inhibitors reduced cytoplasmic translocation of E-cadherin induced by CoCM (Fig. 4B), again indicating that both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are involved in CoCM induced cell scattering. Hence, CoCM stimulates tumor cell scattering via activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling.CoCM Causes Increased Tumor Growth and Metastasis In Vivo Cell migration and cell scattering are in vitro correlates of increased tumor cell malignancy. Thus, we next asked if the transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM alters in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of CA1a cells. First we treated CA1a cells with CoCM for 4 d in vitro, and then we washed, trypsinized, and injected cells into the mammary fat pads of SCID mice (Fig. 5A). The ex vivo pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM significantly accelerated primary tumor growth at the orthotopic site when compared to CA1a cells treated with TuCM, FbCM or medium alone (Fig. 5B).CoCM increases tumorigenicity and expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells.\nA. Experimental design of orthotopic implantation- and tail vein injection models. CA1a cells were pre-treated ex vitro with CM for 4 days, trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in DPBS. Orthotopic Implantation Model. 4\u00d7104 cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor size was assessed thrice weekly using calipers. Estimated tumor volumes were calculated by the formula (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail Vein Injection Model. 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS were injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice, and animals were monitored twice weekly for signs of metastasis. B.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM accelerates growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors in vivo. The axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice were bilaterally inoculated with CA1a cells that were pre-treated with CM (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor volumes at day 23 were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Kruskal Wallis test/Dunn's multiple comparison; p<0.001; CoCM vs TuCM: ***, CoCM vs FbCM: **, CoCM vs medium: ***, TuCM vs FbCM: N.S., TuCM vs medium: N.S., FbCM vs medium: N.S.. Representative of 2 independent experiments. C.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM results in extrapulmonary metastases in tail vein injection assays. CA1a cells were incubated with conditioned media for 4 days and injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice. While all animals developed lung metastases, only animals injected with CoCM treated CA1a cells developed extrapulmonary tumors. Extrapulmonary tumor growth was suppressed when TGF-\u03b2 signaling was inhibited by the ALK 5 inhibitor SB431542 during exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM. Animals receiving CoCM pre-treated cells had significantly higher occurrence of extrapulmonary tumors than all other groups (Chi Square Test, tail vein injection #1: p\u200a=\u200a0.0002; tail vein injection #2: p\u200a=\u200a0.0085). D. Functional TGF-\u03b2 signaling of tumor cells is required for CoCM induced formation of extrapulmonary metastases. Blocking of ALK5 mediated TGF-\u03b2 signaling by the ALK5-inhibitor SB435142 during in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM inhibited metastases and significantly increased survival time of animals in vivo (median survival: CoCM: 62 days (n\u200a=\u200a13 animals), SB431542: 96 days (n\u200a=\u200a14 animals), Kaplan Maier Analysis, p<0.0001).The metastatic potential of CoCM treated cells was explored by injection into the tail vein of NOD SCID mice because the CA1a cell line does not metastasize efficiently from the orthotopic site. Additionally this assay format allows metastatic efficiency to be assessed independently of any effect of the experimental intervention on tumor development at the primary site. Mice in all experimental groups developed metastatic colonies of CA1a cells in the lung (Fig. 5C) and no differences of the number of lung colonies were found between the CoCM- and other treatment groups at day 40 after injections of tumor cells (Fig. S4); however, we observed a fairly high frequency of tumor colonization at extrapulmonary sites exclusively in animals that were injected with tumor cells that had been pre-treated with CoCM (Fig. 5C). Extrapulmonary tumors were seen at subcutaneous sites in the proximity of axillary and inguinal mammary fat pads, and in the thoracic wall. Histologically, subcutaneous metastatic tumors resembled the xenografted primary tumors (Fig. 6A, B).CoCM expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells and induces sustained TGF-\u03b2 signaling via pSmad2.\nA. Extrapulmonary tumors formed by CoCM pre-treated CA1a cells after tail vein injection were highly invasive. Extrapulmonary tumors were observed in the subcutaneously, often in the proximity to mammary fat pads (arrows indicate a normal mammary duct, hematoxylin-eosin staining). B. Xenograft tumors and extrapulmonary metastatic tumors derived from CoCM pre-treated cells have higher levels of nuclear pSmad2 than xenograft tumors derived from medium pre-treated CA1a cells as shown by immunostaining. Levels of pSmad2 in xenograft and metastatic tumors were higher in CA1a cells invading the surrounding tissue (arrows) as compared to tumor cells in the center of tumors. The negative control was obtained by omitting the primary antibody. C. Nuclear pSmad2 is increased in tumor cells at the tumor stroma border (arrows) as compared to cells in the center of tumors that spontaneously developed in a C3(1)TAg model of breast cancer and in an orthotopic syngeneic model of breast cancer (4T1 cells/BALB/c mice).We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 was the component of the CoCM that was responsible for the expanded metastatic range of CA1a cells treated with CoCM. To do this we included the ALK5 kinase inhibitor SB431542 during the 4 day pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM. After washing away the SB431542 together with the CoCM, the CA1a cells were injected into NOD SCID mice using the same experimental design as before. Ex vivo incubation of CA1a cells with CoCM and SB431542 as compared to CoCM, resulted in significantly increased survival rates in tail vein metastasis assays (Fig. 5D). Again, we observed that animals injected with CoCM treated cells or with CoCM + SB435142 treated cells equally developed lung metastases (Fig. 5C), and when re-plated in regular culture medium, proliferation of CA1a cells pre-treated with CoCM was equal to proliferation of CA1a cells pretreated with CoCM +SB431542, indicating that SB431542 did not negatively influence proliferation or survival of pre-treated cells (data not shown). However, only 1/14 animal injected with CoCM + SB431542 developed an extrapulmonary tumor, while 5/15 animals that were injected with CoCM treated tumors developed extrapulmonary tumors in tail vein assays (Fig. 5C). Thus, a transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM and consequent activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in these cells not only durably increases tumorigenicity but also permits successful colonization of a wider range of target tissues.Active TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Sustained in Tumors Originating from CoCM Treated CellsWe next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells is durably increased in vivo after stimulation of CA1a cells with TGF-\u03b2 containing CoCM in vitro. Nuclear pSmad2 levels were higher in xenograft tumors or metastatic tumors originating from CoCM treated cells than in xenograft tumors originating from medium treated cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells by treatment with CoCM is sustained in vivo, indicating that the transient exposure of CA1a cells to elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels causes a durable change in TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity.TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Increased at the Tumor - Stroma Border of Tumors in Several Mouse ModelsNext, we investigated whether TGF-\u03b2 signaling is increased when tumor cells invade the fibroblast-containing stroma surrounding a primary tumor as would be predicted from our observations. Immunostaining of pSmad2 in sections of mammary tumors derived from different mouse breast cancer models (CA1a xenograft tumors, syngeneic mouse mammary tumor (4T1), and tumors from the C3(1)TAg transgenic model) revealed that pSmad2 levels are higher in cells at the tumor stroma border, and particularly in those cells invading the surrounding stroma, as compared to tumor cells in the center of the tumor (Fig. 6C). Thus, activation of pSmad2 naturally occurs when tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma.Taken together, our results imply that tumor cells, once they traverse through the surrounding stroma, can subvert normal fibroblasts to increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in the microenvironment that then induces tumor cell migration, cell scattering, and an expanded metastatic pattern, thereby boosting the malignancy of tumor cells (Fig. 7).Tumor-stroma interactions increase malignancy of tumor cells by bidirectional effects of TGF-\u03b2.Direct interactions of tumor cells and fibroblasts as they occur when parenchymal tumor cells invade the underlying stroma increase secretion of TGF-\u03b2 by tumor cells as well as by fibroblasts. TGF-\u03b2 has bidirectional effects on both cells types. Fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2 can directly stimulate tumor cell migration and malignancy. Tumor cell derived TGF-\u03b2 induces fibroblasts to secrete MMP-9. Increased MMP-9 levels then might further increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2, and also facilitate matrix degradation and migration of tumor cells, further increasing the malignant potential of tumor cells.DiscussionInteractions between tumor cells and the fibroblasts of the tumor microenvironment are complex, reciprocal and stage-dependent. Here we have shown that transient interactions of breast carcinoma cells with normal fibroblasts in vitro can increase tumor cell malignancy and expand the metastatic range of tumor cells in vivo by a TGF-\u03b2 dependent mechanism. Specifically, the interaction of human breast carcinoma cells with normal murine fibroblasts induces aberrant secretion of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. This transient exposure of tumor cells to fibroblast-derived TGF-\u03b2 then durably increases tumorigenesis even when the two cell types are no longer interacting. Thus, tumor cells traversing through connective tissue may exploit their transient interaction with normal fibroblasts so as to get a boost in the metastatic process (Fig. 7). This phenomenon has a number of interesting features that are discussed below.Emergent Properties and Reciprocity in the Co-CulturesThe interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can generate emergent system properties that are not seen when the cells are cultured separately. Our experimental design allowed us to focus specifically on the impact of this interaction on the tumor cells, and to start to identify soluble mediators. We showed that co-culture of the two cell types significantly increased the levels of fibroblast derived active TGF-\u03b2 in the extracellular environment, and that this TGF-\u03b2 subsequently enhanced migration of the tumor cells in vitro and malignant behavior in vivo. It has been previously proposed that tumor cells can induce a reversibly \u201cprimed state\u201d in normal fibroblasts, in which the fibroblasts can promote tumorigenesis even though they do not have all the characteristics of the irreversibly modified CAFs. Our data suggest that such priming may involve cancer cell-induced production of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. It is likely that TGF-\u03b2 produced by these primed fibroblasts contributes to the elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels that are seen in the vicinity of many advanced human tumors.Co-cultures of fibroblasts and tumor cells showed increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell compartments, consistent with the presence of activated TGF-\u03b2 in the CoCM (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the tumor cell compartment in this co-culture model can induce MMP-9 secretion by fibroblasts in a Smad-, ras- and PI3K dependent fashion. In the present work, we demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the fibroblast compartment enhanced the migration of tumor cells through the activation of Smad-, p38- and JNK-signaling cascades. Together the data suggest that TGF-\u03b2-mediated signaling between the tumor cells and fibroblasts is bidirectional, involves a distinct combination of signaling cascades in each partner, and has different molecular outcomes in each compartment. It is currently not clear how the two cell types can selectively respond to the TGF-\u03b2 produced by the other, but this phenomenon conceivably might reflect differences in TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, and/or structure of the latent complexes made by each cell type, as well as cell specific regulation of signal flux through the TGF-\u03b2 network within each cell type. However, since MMP-9 can create a microenvironment more favorable to invasion and metastasis through activation of growth factors, specifically TGF-\u03b2, and destruction of extracellular matrix, the combined biological outcome of the differing effects of TGF-\u03b2 on each compartment is likely to be a further enhancement of malignant behavior (Fig. 7).Transient Tumor-Fibroblast Interactions Generate Small Magnitude Molecular Effects That Induce Major Changes in OutcomeExposure of rat mammary tumor cells to exogenous TGF-\u03b2 ex vivo has previously been shown to promote metastatic efficiency in vivo . Here we have shown that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts, such as might occur when tumor cells traverse the surrounding tissue, can have a similar effect. The amount of active TGF-\u03b2 that was produced by the coculture was very low, and the activation of downstream signaling pathways was similarly mild (Figs 2 to   5). Nevertheless, these small magnitude, endogenous molecular effects altered the phenotype of the tumor cell such that it showed significantly increased malignant behavior even when no longer in contact with the fibroblast compartment. The data imply that carcinoma cells that have breached the basement membrane and are migrating through underlying connective tissue may be able to subvert and use resident, TGF-\u03b2 secreting fibroblasts to boost their motility and subsequent metastatic spread.Underlying MechanismsTGF-\u03b2 has a number of tumor cell-targeted effects that could contribute to the enhanced malignancy, including enhancement of tumor cell migration and invasion, direct effects on tumor cell survival, and changes in the composition of secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix components. The stimulatory effect of CoCM on primary tumor growth may reflect pro-survival effects of TGF-\u03b2 on CA1a cells as TGF-\u03b2 reduces apoptosis of CA1a cells (Fig. S1B), possibly acting in concert with other as yet unidentified trophic factors in the CM.The ability of TGF-\u03b2 to promote migration and invasion of CA1a cells may contribute to the enhanced metastasis, but additional mechanisms such as altered expression levels of junctional proteins like E-cadherin, integrins, or chemokines and chemokine receptors are also likely to play a role. For example, the organ tropism of metastatic tumors is determined in part by the spectrum of chemokines and chemokine receptors that they express, and TGF-\u03b2s have been shown to modulate relevant chemokine ligand/receptor axes in other models. TGF-\u03b2 derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts upregulates CXCR4 in initiated prostatic epithelial cells, and expression of CXCR4 correlates with lymph node metastasis in multiple human tumors. It will be the aim of future work to determine which mechanism is relevant for the expanded metastatic range shown by the CA1a breast cancer cells stimulated with fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2.Consequences and ConclusionsIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that a relatively short-lived interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts induces changes in the localized extracellular microenvironment that then substantially increase the malignancy of the tumor cells even after the original interaction has ceased. The data imply that normal resident fibroblasts that are exposed to direct contact with invading tumor cells may boost the motility and subsequent metastatic spread of these carcinoma cells. TGF-\u03b2 appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-\u03b2 pathway.Materials and MethodsCell Culture and Generation of Conditioned MediaMCF10CA1a (\u201cCA1a\u201d) is a malignant, metastatic human breast cancer line. Mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) were derived from newborn mice as previously described. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from embryos (ED 12 to ED 14) by suspending embryonic tissue in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (\u201cfibroblast medium\u201d). CA1a and DF were respectively grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (\u201cCA1a medium\u201d) and DMEM, low glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen or Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). To obtain conditioned media from homotypic cultures or cocultures, 1.5\u00d7106 cells of each type were plated in a 150 cm2 dish and incubated in a 1\u22361 mixture of CA1a- and fibroblast medium (\u201ccoculture medium\u201d). Culture supernatants were collected after 4 d and cells were removed by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min). Acellular supernatants were diluted with fresh coculture medium (conditioned medium, CM) and used for further experiments.Cell Scattering and MigrationDot AssayTo assess cell scattering, 20 \u00b5l of cell suspension (3\u00d7106 CA1a cells/ml) were placed in each well of 6-well plates and allowed to adhere to form tight well-circumscribed colonies. After 3 hours non-attached cells were removed by rinsing the plate with calcium-containing Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were incubated in regular culture medium overnight, and then switched for 4 days to a 1\u22361 mixture of CM and fresh coculture medium. Cell scattering was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically following staining with hematoxylin-eosin. Unconditioned medium served as an additional negative control. The effect of growth factors and cytokines on cell scattering was assessed by adding the following growth factors in concentrations as indicated to the culture medium for 4 days: human TGF-\u03b21, human EGF, LAP (all R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), human TNF-\u03b1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and HGF (kind gift from Don Bottaro). Where indicated, small molecule inhibitors of various signaling pathways (ALK4,5,7: SB431542, 5 \u00b5M, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; MEK/Erk: PD98059, 25 \u00b5M; p38: SB203580, 10 \u00b5M; JNK: SP600125, 10 \u00b5M (all Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)) were added to cultures 30 min before stimulation with the conditioned medium. Equal amounts of DMSO served as a negative control.Scratch AssayCA1a cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to confluence. Cell proliferation was blocked by a 30 min pretreatment with mitomycin C (25 \u00b5g/ml). A scratch was then made in each well using a 100 \u00b5l pipette tip and cells were stimulated with the various CM in 1\u22361 mixtures with fresh coculture medium. The scratch width at different time points was imaged and measured using ImagePro. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 2.0.Immunostaining and Western BlottingImmunofluorescence and Western Blotting were performed following established protocols. The following antibodies were used: Immunofluorescence: phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, phospho-ATF2, phospho-MAPKAPK2 (all 1\u2236100, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and E-cadherin (1\u2236800, Zymed, Carlsbad, CA). Western Blotting: Smad3 (1\u22361000, Zymed), Smad2/3 (1\u22361000, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), phospho-Smad3 (1\u223612 000, Gift from E. Leoff), phospho-Smad2, phospho-TAK, TAK (both 1\u22361000, Cell Signaling), and actin (1\u223660 000, BD Biosciences) for Western Blotting. Immunoperoxidase staining for phospho-Smad2 (1\u2236500, Millipore, Temecula,CA) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections.Transfection, Reporter Assays, and Lentiviral InfectionTransfection of CA1a cells with the CAGA12-luciferase plasmid or with the reporter plasmids ARE-luciferase/FAST-1, and lentiviral infections were performed as described previously.Quantification of TGF-\u03b2Levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in CM were determined using PAI-driven luciferase expression in CCL-64 cells. Briefly, CCL-64 cells that were stably transfected with PAI-luc were cultured in 48-well plates (20000 cells/well) in 200 \u00b5l RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS for 36 hours and serum starved (RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS) for 8 hours. Then 100 \u00b5l medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul CM (sample) or 100 \u00b5l unconditioned medium spiked with varying concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 to establish a standard curve. Cells were incubated over night, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vivo TumorigenesisFemale SCID and NOD SCID animals (age: 8\u201310 weeks) were purchased from the NCI Animal Production Program. For tumorigenesis studies, 4\u00d7104 tumor cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the # II and # VII mammary fat pads of female SCID mice. Tumor size was assessed using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula for an oblique spheroid (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail vein injection assays were performed by injecting 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS into the tail vein of female NOD SCID animals. Mice were euthanized after 8 weeks or when animals became moribund and examined grossly on necropsy for the presence of metastases in multiple organs. Metastasis was confirmed histologically.Orthotopic syngeneic mammary tumors of mouse breast cancer cells (4T1) in BALB/c mice and C3(1)TAg tumors were grown as previously described.Statistical AnalysisCumulative tumor volumes and survival graphs were analyzed by ANOVA (post hoc test Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Analysis), Kruskal-Wallis test (post hoc test Dunn's Multiple Comparison Analysis), Chi Square test, and Kaplan-Maier assays using Graph Pad Prism 5.0b.

Fibroblasts are one of the major constituents of the tumor stroma and are crucial for tumor progression. Cancer cells originating from the normal epithelial cells can transform stromal fibroblasts in their vicinity to a myofibroblastic phenotype called the Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). The tumorigenic potential of the cancer cells can be increased up to many-fold, if they are injected along with the CAFs than with fibroblasts from normal tissues i.e, NFs. CAFs enhance cancer progression through their paracrine activity by the increased secretion of growth factors and cytokines, which also help in remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Once they are \u2018educated\u2019 by cancer cells, CAFs can instigate expression of mesenchymal markers like Vimentin, \u03b1SMA, FAP, FSP, SDF-1, MMPs, HGF and TGF-\u03b2.Recent reports indicate that CAFs from the primary tumor site move through the blood stream to the distant metastatic sites along with the cancer cells and disseminate themselves. These CAFs from the primary site will undergo cell death once the fibroblast cells of the distant organ/ metastatic site take up the function of supporting tumor progression. It has been reported earlier that cancer cells harboring more oncogenic mutations can have a stronger stromal interaction. In this context, BRCA1 gene mutation that causes predisposition to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers has also been reported to increase the metastatic ability of cancer cells. Recent reports prove that the full length BRCA1 protein (but not C terminal mutant) via its BRCT domains interacts with and inhibits the protein super family ERM, which are located at the plasma membrane, resulting in the inhibition of the motility of cancer cells. Moreover, BRCA1 deficiency in cancer cells can create oxidative stress in both cancer cells and CAFs along with increased glycolysis in CAFs. These reports have led us to hypothesize that BRCA1 deficient cancer cells can transform CAFs to an altered form, which we named as MAF that can assist in the metastasis of cancer cells. MAF may increase the tumorigenic competence of the BRCA1 defective cancer cells hence leading to rapid metastasis, which makes them a potential target in cancer therapy. In this study, we co-cultured primary CAFs (isolated from human breast cancer patient tissues) with BRCA1 deficient and proficient cancer cells in vitro and demonstrated that CAFs can be converted to MAFs in the presence of BRCA1 defective cancer cells. We have also shown that inhibitors to MAF specific proteins can attenuate the migration and invasion ability in vitro. We presume that this would also hinder the support that would be provided by the MAF to the cancer cells that disseminate from the primary site.ResultsCAFs induce enhanced tumorigenicity in BRCA1 deficient than proficient breast cancer cellsCAFs from the breast cancer tissues can increase proliferation, migration and invasion in BRCA1 deficient breast cancer cells through EMT.

Quantitation for the western blot analysis of figure H is indicated in the lower panel. Cells grown in RPMI 1640 with 2% FBS was used as the control in all the experiments and average of three independent experiments in triplicates are represented [*p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, (n\u2009=\u20094)]. All error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation.For determining the fibroblast-induced tumorigenicity, we co-cultured CAFs and NFs (n\u2009=\u200920) with the BRCA1 proficient and deficient breast cancer cells (Fig.\u00a01A). We observed an increased expression of CAFs-specific markers, Vimentin, CD10, FAP, \u03b1SMA and FSP when compared to NFs and the epithelial marker cytokeratin 14 was found to be absent in CAFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1A\u2013D). BRCA1 defective HCC1937 exhibited a significantly higher proliferation rate than the isogenic BRCA1 proficient HCC1937/wt BRCA1 cells, when co-cultured with the conditioned medium (cm) from CAFs (cmCAFs) as evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays (Fig.\u00a01B,C). Similarly, it was observed that the migratory and invasive capacity was more in HCC1937 than in isogenic BRCA1 proficient cells when co-cultured with cmCAFs (Fig.\u00a01D,E).CAFs significantly induced metastatic markers in BRCA1 defective cancer cells.

Immunofluorescence counter staining was done with DAPI. [***p\u2009<\u20090.001, (n\u2009=\u20093)]. All experiments were done in triplicates. All error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation.These observations led us to analyze the process of EMT in these cells and we observed that cmCAFs could induce EMT more efficiently in HCC1937 than HCC1937/wtBRCA1, which was confirmed by reduction in E-cadherin and over expression of Fibronectin, Vimentin and N-, cadherin markers (Fig.\u00a01F\u2013H and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6). Further, in the co-culture experiments we analyzed the changes in the expression of different genes involved in the process of cell dissemination. Approximately, 40 and 30 fold increase in the mRNA expression of the metastatic markers CCL5 and Ezrin respectively was observed in HCC1937 in comparison to HCC1937/wt BRCA1 cells, when these cells were co-cultured with the cmCAFs (Fig.\u00a02A). The expression of ERM proteins was found to be upregulated particularly in BRCA1 defective cells when co-cultured with cmCAFs (Fig.\u00a02B, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S6). Corroborating with the real time data, a more pronounced increase in the protein expression of angiogenic and tumorigenic markers like SDF-1, CXCR4, CD10 and CCL5, which play crucial roles in metastasis, was observed in HCC1937 cells over HCC1937/wt BRCA1 when cultured with the cmCAFs (Fig.\u00a02C).There was also a reduction, albeit not statistically significant, in the expression of the tumor suppressors, BRCA1 and p53 mRNA in HCC1937 than HCC1937/wt BRCA1 grown with cmCAFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2A). However, it was observed that the expression of BRCA1 protein (mutant) in HCC1937 cells increased, whereas there was a reduction in the expression of wild type BRCA1 protein in HCC1937/wt BRCA1 cells (Fig.\u00a02D). Also, the expression of the DNA damage repair protein, \u03b3H2A.X, was increased in HCC1937/wt BRCA1, but there was no change in HCC1937 cells, due to the presence of cmCAFs. Besides there was a down regulation of caveolin-1 mRNA, which is crucial for regulating cell motility. Apart from this, at the protein level, we observed a cytoplasm to cell membrane translocation of Caveolin-1 in HCC1937/wt BRCA1 and its absence in HCC1937 cells when co-cultured with cmCAFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2B). These results suggest the role of CAFs in creating aggressiveness in the breast cancer cells particularly with BRCA1 mutation through EMT.BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells induce the transformation of CAFs to MAFCAFs co-cultured with cmHCC1937 are characterized by their increased expression of metastatic and EMT markers.

Individual values of each sample are represented in Supplementary Table\u00a0S1. qRT-PCR expression for (F) E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Fibronectin (G) Immunofluorescence analysis for the expression of Vimentin, FSP, E-cadherin, SDF-1, CCL5 and N-cadherin in CAFs co-treated with cmHCC1937 and cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Scale bar 10\u2009\u00b5M). DMEM with 2% FBS were used as the control for all the experiments. [*p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001, (n\u2009=\u20093)]. All error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation.Having understood the role of CAFs on BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells; we subsequently assessed the reciprocal effect of BRCA1 deficient cancer cells on CAFs. For this, we cultured primary CAFs from Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) (n\u2009=\u20094) with cmHCC1937 or cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 for 5 days. We speculated that CAFs would be transformed to MAF only when grown with cmHCC1937 and not with cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1. Meanwhile our previous studies on the proteomic profile of BRCA1 deficient cells (HCC1937) shows that these cells express high levels of stem cell markers and other secretory proteins when compared to that of BRCA1 proficient cells (HCC1937/wt BRCA1). Since there was a significant increase in the proliferation rate of CAFs incubated with cmHCC1937 and not in CAFs incubated with cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (as evident from the MTT and the colony formation assay), we presumed that the CAFs might have been transformed to an altered phenotype by the secretory elements or soluble factors from the BRCA1 deficient cancer cells (Fig.\u00a03A,B). Further, we noted a comparable increase in the migration and wound healing capability of these altered CAFs (Fig.\u00a03C,D). These results were confirmed using cm from BRCA1 wild type MCF-7, MDA-MB 231 cells and BRCA1 defective MX1 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2C). We were unable to observe any notable morphological difference between CAFs treated with cmHCC1937 and cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S2D). Also, there was no significant changes in the percentage of CD10 population in CAFs grown with cmHCC1937/ cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3A). These results indicate that gene mutations that affect the cell motility in cancer cells can transform CAFs to MAF.MAF has an augmented expression of metastatic and EMT markersDuda et al. tracked the CAF cells after tagging them with GFP and showed that CAF (that is equivalent to MAF in the present in vitro study) are moving along with cancer cells to the metastatic sites. These MAF cells have higher migration rates and higher expression of metastatic proteins like Ezrin and CCL5. Concurrently, in our study, we found that there was a profound increase in the mRNA expression of CCL5, Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin in CAFs co-cultured with the cmHCC1937, particularly from IDC tissue samples (Fig.\u00a03E and Supplementary Table\u00a0S1). Besides, there was an augmented expression of EMT markers with reduction in E-cadherin and induction of Fibronectin, in CAFs co-cultured with the HCC1937 when compared with those co-cultured with HCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Fig.\u00a03F). The mRNA levels of Caveolin-1, BRCA1 and p53 were down regulated in CAFs grown with HCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3B). The CAFs might have undergone EMT to generate MAF as there was an induction in mesenchymal proteins, CCL5 and N-Cadherin with concomitant decrease in E-Cadherin (Fig.\u00a03G). Thus, BRCA1 mutation in cancer cells can impart increased mesenchymal phenotype in CAFs.MAF possess enhanced tissue remodeling abilityMetastasis associated protein expression in CAFs directly co-cultured with HCC1937 and HCC1937/wt BRCA1. Immunofluorescence analysis for the expression of (A) Vimentin, FSP, MMP9 and SDF-1 after direct co-culture of CAFs and breast cancer cells and (B) BRCA1 and \u03b3H2A.X expression after direct co-culture of breast cancer cells with CAFs. Cytokeratin 18 (K18) is used to distinguish CAFs cells from cancer cells (Scale bar 10\u2009\u00b5M). (C) Phase contrast images of the spheres formed after 3D culture of NFs, HCC1937 with NFs, HCC1937 with CAFs, HCC1937, CAFs, HCC1937/wt BRCA1 with NFs, HCC1937/wt BRCA1 with CAFs, and HCC1937/wt BRCA1 and the right panel shows the graphical representation of number of spheres formed in the above experiment (D) Phase contrast images of duct like structures formed after 3D co-culture of breast cancer cells with CAFs. Black arrows indicate the ducts formed in co-cultures. Images were taken after 20 days of co-culture in a scaffold with intermediate change of medium after every three days. [**p\u2009<\u20090.01, (n\u2009=\u20093)]. All error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation.We further performed a direct co-culture of CAFs and cancer cells in vitro to substantiate the above findings with indirect co-culture. The expression of different metastatic associated protein markers like FSP, MMP9 and SDF-1 are increased in CAFs directly co-cultured with HCC1937 than those co-cultured with HCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Fig.\u00a04A). Similar to the observations in cancer cells co-cultures with cmCAFs; we observed that in direct co-culture also the foci formation by, \u03b3H2A.X was higher in HCC1937/wt BRCA1 than in HCC1937 cells (Fig.\u00a04B). Further, we confirmed the increased expression of Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin and CCL5 in Lymphovascular Infiltrating (LIF) tumor tissues when compared to the Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) and the normal breast tissues by immunohistochemical analysis of Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S3C). Additionally, a 20\u2009day direct 3D co-culture in a scaffold mimicking the ECM, revealed that both the number and size of the spheres formed by HCC1937 with CAFs were significantly higher than HCC1937/wt BRCA1 cells with CAFs/NFs or HCC1937 with NFs (Fig.\u00a04C). It is interesting to note that HCC1937 with CAFs could form duct like structures when compared to HCC1937/wt BRCA1 with CAFs (Fig.\u00a04D). This suggests that in the presence of CAFs, BRCA1 mutated cancer cells in aggressive cancers have the potential to induce tissue remodeling during tumor progression.Changes observed in BFs and NFs from the adjacent tissue with BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cells. (A) Immunofluorescence analysis for the expression of \u03b1SMA, FAP, Vimentin and Caveolin-1 in BFs and NFs (Magnification: 60X).

(D) Invasion (right panel represents the quantification of the invasion assay) and (E) Migration assay of BFs in the presence of cmHCC1937 and cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 by transwell migration method. (F) qRT-PCR analysis for the expression of metastatic markers in BFs after co-culturing BFs with cmHCC1937 and cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1. BFs/NFs grown in DMEM with 2% FBS were used as the control. All the experiments were done in triplicates and standard error was calculated by taking the SD values of the average. [**p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001]. All error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation.We have also noticed that the fibroblast cells from a benign breast tissue (BFs), which was positive for \u03b1SMA, FAP, Vimentin and Caveolin-1, did not show significant difference in the growth rate compared to NFs when grown with cmHCC1937 or cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Fig.\u00a05A,B). Also, there was no significant increase in the proliferation rate of HCC1937 cells grown in cmBFs when compared to cmNFs (Fig.\u00a05C). Interestingly, an extensive increase in the number of invading and migrating BFs was observed in presence of cmHCC1937 when compared to BFs co-cultured with cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Fig.\u00a05D,E). But in contrast, we did not observe much difference in the expression of Ezrin, Radixin, \u03b1SMA, Vimentin and BRCA1, except for CCL5, which has an extensively increased fold activation in BFs after co-culture with cmHCC1937 (Fig.\u00a05F). This suggests that BFs may have the potential to induce metastasis by transforming themselves if the environment is favorable and also that the CAFs and BRCA1-mutated cancer cells have reciprocal regulatory effects on one another.All these observations compelled us to consider the existence of a group of CAFs, with an altered phenotype (embedded among the primary CAFs), that is conditioned by BRCA1 mutated cancer cells. These \u2018altered\u2019 CAFs could then facilitate tumor metastasis. We named the altered CAFs co-cultured with HCC1937 and HCC1937/wt BRCA1 as MAF and CAF respectively.Inhibitors targeting CCL5 and Ezrin impede the alteration of CAFs to MAFInhibitors targeting CCL5 and Ezrin attenuated the metastatic potential of MAF. qRT-PCR analysis for the mRNA expression of metastasis associated genes after treating (A) MAF and CAF with metCCL5 and (B) HCC1937 and HCC1937/wt BRCA1 in cmCAFs with metCCL5.

(I) Secretory levels of CCL5 in CAFs, CAF, MAF and MAF/CAF after CCL5/Ezrin inhibition by ELISA analysis. All error bars in the graphs represent standard deviation.We used specific inhibitors of various proteins that are differentially regulated between CAFs and MAF to inhibit CAFs-MAF transformation and subsequently impede metastasis. CCL5 and Ezrin were found to be extensively over expressed in MAF; thus, we intended to inhibit them to unveil the role of these proteins in metastasis. Analysis of transcriptome data sets from TCGA (The cancer genome atlas) using Oncomine and cBioPortal, confirmed the inverse correlation between BRCA1 and CCL5/ Moesin in breast cancer (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4A). A recombinant protein inhibitor metCCL5, could inhibit CCL5 in both HCC1937/wt BRCA1 and HCC1937 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4B). We observed that the CCL5 inhibition could create a slight, however, insignificant difference in the proliferation rate of cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4C). metCCL5 could significantly down regulate the mRNA expression of different genes like Ezrin, Radixin, FSP, and \u03b1SMA, in addition to CCL5 in CAFs co-cultured with both cmHCC1937 and cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Fig.\u00a06A). However, a substantial decline in the mRNA expression of Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin, Vimentin and \u03b1SMA was observed in HCC1937 cells compared to HCC1937/wt BRCA1 when treated with metCCL5 in the presence of cmCAFs (Fig.\u00a06B). The in vitro invasive and migratory potential of both MAF and HCC1937 cells grown with cmCAFs reduced when CCL5 was neutralized with metCCL5 (Fig.\u00a06C,D and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4D).Additionally, Ezrin was transiently inhibited in cancer cells by transfecting with siRNA plasmid against Ezrin. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4E). A significant reduction in the mRNA expression of genes, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin, CCL5, Vimentin, FSP and Caveolin-1 were observed in both the CAFs and MAF (Fig.\u00a06E). Also, Ezrin inhibition could reduce the expression of the above mentioned genes only in HCC1937 cells and not in HCC1937/wt BRCA1 (Fig.\u00a06F). Consistent with the previous observation with metCCL5, Ezrin inhibition also caused a considerable reduction in the migratory and invasive potential of CAFs co-cultured with cmHCC1937 in vitro (Fig.\u00a06G,H). The level of secreted CCL5 was also found to be reduced when both CCL5 and Ezrin were inhibited separately in both CAF and MAF (Fig.\u00a06I). Thus, our results open up avenues to the possibility of targeting CCL5 and Ezrin as a strategy to inhibit the effect of MAF on metastasis, predominantly in BRCA1 defective breast cancers.DiscussionOne of the major cellular components of tumor stroma/ microenvironment is the fibroblast, which is crucial for tumor progression. As reviewed by Kalluri et al., the fibroblast population behaves in a context-dependent manner during different stages of tumor progression. Several gene modifications including BRCA1 mutations in the cancer cells facilitate cancer progression and metastasis. Based on this information, we expected that mutations of BRCA1 might subsequently result in the adaptation of cancer cells by reciprocally altering their stroma to facilitate dissemination to distant sites. After the report by Lisanti et al. on BRCA1 mutation in cancer cells with corresponding Caveolin-1 inhibition, along with induction of glycolysis in CAFs, there are very few reports published on the changes attributed to CAFs by a single gene mutation in cancer cells. Wild type BRCA1 interacts with ERM proteins which are crucial in inhibiting the motility of cancer cells, whereas mutated BRCA1 protein enhances cell motility and migration in vitro. In this study, we depict the crosstalk between CAFs and BRCA1 deficient breast cancer cells in vitro, which results in the transformation of CAFs to an altered phenotype of CAFs, which we named as the MAF.The proliferative potential induced by CAFs on cancer cells is already well known and explained in many cancers. In our study, genetically unstable BRCA1 deficient breast cancer cells exhibited enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion compared to BRCA1 wild type breast cancer cells, when co-cultured with cmCAFs. The increased EMT in epithelial cancer cells by TGF-\u03b2 secretion from CAFs has been well demonstrated, which could also contribute to stemness in cancer cells. Here, we have seen that in presence of CAFs, there is a strong loss of epithelial markers and a modest increase in mesenchymal markers in BRCA1 mutant but not wild type cancer cells confirming the onset of EMT. This can further be correlated with the direct inhibition of EMT markers in the presence of wild type BRCA1, by promoting the proteins TWIST and Slug. Moreover, a recent study divulges the role of exosomal exchange of miRNAs between CAFs and cancer cells resulting in tumorigenic induction via EMT and stemness.It has been reported that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 colocalizes with Ezrin, Moesin, Radixin and F-actin in the plasma membrane and control cell motility. The cytoskeleton linker Ezrin can activate the chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) induced invasive ability in cancers. In connection with this, in our study, co-culture of cmCAFs with HCC1937 cells but not HCC1937/wt BRCA1 cells, exhibited elevated expressions of Ezrin along with the overexpression of CCL5, which may be the reason for enhanced invasion and migration. The increased protein expression of Moesin and Radixin could be due to increased stability of the respective mRNAs. Further, direct and indirect co-culture studies with CAFs, showed an increased \u03b3H2A.X foci formation and BRCA1 protein expression in HCC1937/wt BRCA1 than HCC1937, indicating an efficient DNA damage response that might be occuring in BRCA1 wild type cells. Though there was reduction of mutant BRCA1 mRNA, its protein was expressed in cancer cells when HCC1937 were co-cultured with cmCAFs probably due to increased stability of mutant BRCA1.From the first part of the study we could substantiate the role of CAFs in inducing the metastatic ability exploiting the BRCA1 deficiency in breast cancer cells. Outschoorn et al., 2014, reported that BRCA1 mutated cancer cells induce oxidative stress and enhance glycolysis in CAFs. Besides this, the translocation of CAFs from the primary tumor site to the distant metastatic site, was reported in metastatic colorectal, brain and liver cancers. In this context, we hypothesized that the transformation of CAFs to an altered phenotype could induce metastatic changes in cancer cells and accompany them during metastasis. Here, we speculate that co-culturing CAFs with HCC1937 but not HCC1937/wt BRCA1, could transform CAFs to MAF owing to the strong interaction between mutant BRCA1 protein and metastatic ERM proteins and CCL5.As hypothesized, an enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion was observed when CAFs were treated with cmHCC1937 indicating that CAFs might have transformed to MAF. Moreover, we have observed an extensive induction of CCL5, Ezrin, Moesin and Radixin in MAF when compared to CAF. These changes were attributed mostly to MAF generated from IDC samples. This also indicates that the origin of CAFs plays a crucial role along with mutation status of cancer cells. The increase in the expression of EMT marker proteins in MAF may aid these cells in accompanying the cancer cells to distant metastatic sites. Concurrent with Ezrin and CCL5 expression studies, we observed an increased number of spheres and duct formation when CAFs are grown with HCC1937 as compared with HCC1937/wt BRCA1 in 3D co-culture with CAFs. This indicates the plasticity and aggressiveness attained by the tumors by CAFs. The increase in the number of spheres, reciprocate tissue remodeling ability of BRCA1 mutated cells in the presence of CAFs.We could not observe a noticeable increase in the proliferative induction on BRCA1 defective cancer cells by BFs or vice versa when co-cultured together. However, these fibroblasts from benign hyperplasia could respond to cm from BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells with high induction of CCL5. These observations indicate that the increased migration and invasion seen in BFs by the presence of cmHCC1937 could be due to up regulation of CCL5.The increased expression of metastatic marker proteins CCL5 and Ezrin in MAF is of immense significance. The role of CCL5 secreted by CAF in cancer metastasis is already well established. It is capable of inducing the ERM proteins at the plasma membrane and activates Rho to stimulate EMT in breast cancers. We have already observed an induction of Ezrin and CCL5 proteins in HCC1937 cells co-treated with cmCAFs and also in MAF. ERM protein complex when activated, inhibits cell adhesion and enhances migration and invasion. Ezrin is found to be more crucial than Moesin and Radixin for tumor induction and if Ezrin is inhibited, Radixin and Moesin will also be inhibited. It has been reported that when Ezrin was silenced, CCL5 induced cell motility and invasiveness was also inhibited indicating the potential role for Ezrin in the process of CCL5 induced breast cancer cell metastasis.Therefore, in our study we inhibited the two crucial markers of MAF, Ezrin and CCL5, separately to see whether the metastatic potential of MAF can be attenuated. Both these inhibitors could reduce the expression of CCL5, Ezrin, Radixin and FSP in both CAF and MAF, the reduction in CCL5, Ezrin, Radxin, Moesin, Vimentin and \u03b1-SMA is distinctly high in BRCA1 mutated and wild type cells. As indicated by the expression studies, the wild type BRCA1 is neutralizing the effect of inhibitors when co-cultured with the CAFs. An effective reduction in the migratory and invasive ability along with reduction in the secretory levels of CCL5 protein in MAF than CAF was also observed with both the inhibitors, suggesting the possibility to attenuate the crosstalk between MAF and BRCA1 mutated cancer cells.To conclude, in this study, we provide proof of principle for the concept that novel mutations in key genes that control cancer cell motility and their cumulative effect on CAF can induce metastasis. In the present study, we have focused only on the BRCA1 mutations in the breast cancer cells and their effect on CAF. Even in cases where the BRCA1 phenotype remains normal, mutations in other key genes that control motility might affect the stroma, resulting in cancer progression. When p53 is mutated, its inhibitory on the adhesion molecule EpCam is lost this in turn will initiate migration of cancer cells from the primary site. Similarly BRAF mutation could induce motility in skin cancers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5).Hence, we propose that as cancer cells acquire defects in the metastasis-associated genes, inhibiting MAF would be effective in preventing the transformation of stromal fibroblasts. We identify for the first time that Ezrin or CCL5 inhibitors can target CAFs and prevent their transformation to MAF, especially in BRCA1 mutated conditions. This concept, once validated by in vivo pre-clinical studies, would pave the way for future clinical trials involving combination therapy using inhibitors of MAF specific proteins like CCL5 or Ezrin, along with classical anticancer drugs.Materials and MethodsCell cultureHCC1937, breast adenocarcinoma, triple negative breast cancer cell line with 5382insC mutation in BRCA1 that leads to the synthesis of a C-terminal truncated BRCA1 protein and its isogenic cell line HCC1937/wt BRCA1 where BRCA1 cDNA was subcloned in HCC1937 using pBabe-hygro plasmid were used in the study. MX1 is a triple negative breast carcinoma cell line, consisting of 3363delGAAA in BRCA1 gene that would result in a frame shift mutation, which is predicted to introduce a chain termination and truncate the protein at residue 999. The cell is also burdened with two single nucleotide polymorphisms in BRCA2 (BRCA2 16864\u2009A\u2009>\u2009C and BRCA2 221847\u2009A\u2009>\u2009G). These cells were grown in RPMI (PAN Biotech, Dorset, UK) medium supplemented with 10% FBS (PAN Biotech, Dorset, UK). We have also analyzed Human breast epithelial adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 having wild type BRCA1. These cells were grown in DMEM (GIBCO, California, USA) medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The authenticity of the cell lines has been verified by STR profiling.Isolation of fibroblasts from human breast tissuesCAFs and NFs were isolated from IDC and DCIS tumor tissues and the adjacent non-malignant part of the same resected tissue samples respectively after obtaining the informed consent from the patients and ethical clearance from Institute Human Ethics Committee, Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) (HEC No. 11/2012), and RGCB (IHEC/01/2012/05), Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India and all the experiments were performed following the relevant guidelines and regulations of the institute. Briefly, tissues were washed with 1X PBS, digested with collagenase (Stem Cell Technologies, MA, USA), separated using differential centrifugation method and CAFs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2X antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen, California, USA).ImmunofluorescenceCells grown on coverslips in 24 well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, USA), blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma, USA) and incubated with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table\u00a0S2) overnight. Fluorescence conjugated secondary antibodies specific for primary antibodies were added and incubated at room temperature for 1\u2009h. Cells were then counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen, California, USA) for nucleic acid staining and mounted to observe under a confocal microscope (Nikon).Flow cytometryCells (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) were grown in the 6 well dishes, trypsinized and treated with specific antibodies (fluorescence conjugated) for 45\u2009m in ice and centrifuged. Cell pellets were then strained using 40\u2009\u00b5m cell strainer (BD Falcon, MA, USA) and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACS Aria, CA, USA). The data was then analyzed using FACS Diva software.Western blotFor western blot analysis, the whole cell lysates isolated from the cells using RIPA buffer was quantified using Bradford assay and separated using SDS PAGE using appropriate percentage of acrylamide gel and then transblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots incubated with primary and suitable secondary antibodies were visualized with a chemiluminesence reagent (Thermo scientific). The antibodies used have been detailed in the Supplementary table\u00a0S2.RNA isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA was isolated using the trizol reagent. The ethanol cleared RNA was quantified using nanospectrophotometer (Nanodrop, DE, USA) and 1\u2009\u00b5g of total RNA was converted to cDNA using High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (ABI) as per manufacturers protocol. Relative and absolute quantification of the expression of different genes were done by Sybr green real time PCR kit (Kappa biosystems, MA, USA) using real time PCR analyzer (ABI, CA, USA). The primers used have been listed in the Supplementary table\u00a0S3. The expression levels of the genes were determined through qRT-PCR, normalised to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The log2 (ratio of mRNA level) value is the logarithm of normalised mRNA expression level (2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct) of the samples relative to the normalised mRNA expression level (2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct) of GAPDH.Co-culture studiesIn the indirect co-culture method, cancer cells were either grown with cm from CAFs from 3 days or CAFs were grown with cm from HCC1937 or cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 for 5 days. For collecting cm, cells (cancer cells or CAFs) grown in their respective medium were washed with 1X PBS after they have attained 70% confluency and then incubated with 2% culture media with FBS. After 24\u2009h, the supernatant was collected, centrifuged to remove debris, filtered using 2\u2009\u00b5m pore size syringe filter (Millipore, Boston, UK) and freeze stored until use. In direct co-culture CAFs/NFs and cancer cells (HCC1937 and HCC1937/wt BRCA1) were grown together in dishes and used for various experiments.Cell proliferation assayThe cancer cells (5000 cells/well in a 96 well plate) incubated with the cm from CAFs or vice versa were used for cell proliferation assay. Cancer cells and CAFs were allowed to grow in this medium for 3 or 5 days respectively and then analyzed using the MTT reagent (USB, OH, USA) colorimetrically at 570\u2009nm. The respective cells grown in 2% culture media with FBS served as control.Colony formation, wound healing, migration and invasion assaysFor colony formation assay 1000 cells per well in a six well plate, were seeded and cultured with cm as mentioned above and incubated for 9 days with the addition of fresh cm every third day. The colonies were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized using 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet stain solution and the number of colonies was counted. The colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted and quantitated.In wound healing assay a wound was created with the aid of a 200\u2009\u00b5l pipette tip in the confluent cells in plate. The cells were then incubated with the respective cm as indicated above and the wounds were allowed to heal for 16 hrs. The healing time was noted and distance, the cells migrated was measured with ProgResCapturePro 2.8.8. software.For transwell migration assay, the cells pretreated with cm as indicated above were seeded on to 8\u2009\u00b5m pore size inserts (BD Corning) with 2% culture media with FBS. The lower chamber contained respective medium with 10%FBS and incubated for 24\u2009h for cell migration. The cells in the inserts were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution followed by examining under a compound microscope. The same method was followed for invasion assay except that the inserts used were coated with GFRM (Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD Corning, MA, USA)).3D morphogenesis analysisThe assay was performed using algimatrix scaffold based system from ABI technologies, CA, USA as per the protocol. To the activated scaffolds in the plate, CAFs and HCC1937 or HCC1937/wt BRCA1 were added in 1:2 ratio in 2% culture media with FBS and incubated for 20 days with regular change of medium on every three days. The spheres, thus formed, were analyzed for their difference in size and number using a phase contrast microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Further, the spheres were isolated after dissolving the scaffolds as per the protocol.Immunohistochemical analysisThe paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) sections of both IDC and DCIS were analyzed for the expression of various proteins using IHC kit from Biogenex, CA, USA as per the protocol. The chromogen used was DAB, counter stain used was hematoxylin and the tissue sections were mounted with DPX and observed under a compound microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).Generation of MAF or CAFThe CAFs isolated from IDC and DCIS patient tissues were co-cultured for 5 days in cm from HCC1937 (cmHCC1937) and HCC1937/wtBRCA1 (cmHCC1937/wtBRCA1) for the generation of MAF and CAF respectively and characterized.CCL5 and Ezrin inhibitionFor CCL5 inhibition, met-RANTES (R&D systems, MN, USA), a recombinant protein, which is shown to be a partial agonist in the monocyte chemotactic assays, was used. The cells were treated with 100\u2009ng metCCL5 and the inhibition of CCL5 was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Cancer cells or CAFs cultured in presence of cmCAFs or cmHCC1937 and cmHCC1937/wt BRCA1 respectively were treated with or without metCCL5 for 48\u2009h and then used for further analysis.For Ezrin inhibition, pBS/U6 ezrin siRNA, which was a gift from Philip Hinds (Addgene plasmid # 8945) were used for transiently transfecting cancer cells/CAFs using lipofectamine reagent. The inhibition was confirmed with qRT-PCR. Further ELISA, migration and invasion assays were done.ELISAMAF and CAF were treated with CCL5 inhibitor, metCCL5 or transfected with EzrinsiRNA for 48\u2009h. The cm collected from these cells were analyzed for CCL5 using the Human Rantes Elisa kit (Calbiochem, CA, USA) as per the kit protocol.Statistical analysisAll the experiments were repeated at least thrice and expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from at least three independent experiments. Error bars were given on the basis of calculated S.D values. The two tailed students t-test and ANOVA was used to test the probability of significant differences between different experimental groups. Statistical significance was defined as *p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 and **p\u2009\u2264\u20090.005 and as ***p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001.Electronic supplementary materialPublisher's note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1038/s41598-018-32370-w.Author ContributionsS.K.H. performed the experiments, analysis and drafted the manuscript.

        "content": "Stromal fibroblasts are important for normal breast homeostasis and regulation of epithelial growth; however, this regulatory function is altered during carcinogenesis. To study the role of fibroblasts in the development of breast cancer, fibroblasts derived from normal breast (NAFs) were incorporated into the MCF10AT xenograft model of progressive proliferative breast disease. The persistence of human NAFs in xenografts was established by intracellular labeling and tyramide-coupled fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, the number of MCF10AT epithelial structures was decreased, and the rate of epithelial cell apoptosis was increased in xenografts containing NAFs. However, these changes were primarily in low-grade epithelial structures, corresponding to normal or mildly hyperplastic ductal epithelium. The level and rate of apoptosis of high-grade epithelial structures, corresponding to in situ and invasive carcinoma, were not consistently altered by NAFs. In addition, there was variability in the growth-inhibitory capacity of NAFs derived from different individuals. NAFs induced changes in the morphology of high-grade MCF10AT structures and in xenograft stroma, including the composition of extracellular matrix, and increased angiogenesis and lymphocytic infiltration. These findings imply that NAFs can inhibit the growth of normal and hyperplastic epi-thelium but are less able to regulate the more transformed epithelial cells that arise during carcino-genesis.",

We show that the ectopic addition of each of the three ligands to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) elevates the expression of CD36, as well as the adipogenic marker FABP4. Lastly, we show that an agonist antibody for one of the PENK receptors induces growth suppression of all cancer cell lines tested but not for non-transformed MCF10A cells. These results clearly suggest that proteins secreted from CD36+ FBs induce not only growth suppression of tumor cells through binding the cognate receptors but also increasing adipogenic markers of CAFs to reprogram tumor stroma.1. IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

        "content": "Accumulating evidence suggests that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit the growth of breast tumors by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen. However, it remains unknown whether the aromatase inhibitor letrozole has an additional impact on CAFs, which further influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Primary CAFs were isolated from primary estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumors. Estrogen-deprived culture medium was used to exclude the influence of steroids. In co-culture, primary cultured CAFs increased MCF7 cell adhesion, invasion, migration and proliferation, and letrozole treatment inhibited these increases, except for the increase in proliferation. In total, 258 up-regulated genes and 47 down-regulated genes with an absolute fold change &gt;2 were identified in CAFs co-cultured with MCF7 cell after letrozole treatment. One up-regulated genes (POSTN) and seven down-regulated genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, IL-8, CXCL5, LEP and NGF) were further validated by real-time PCR. The changes in CCL2 and CXCL1 expression were further confirmed using an automated microscopic imaging-based, high content analysis platform. Although the results need further functional validation, this study is the first to describe the differential tumor-promoting phenotype of CAFs induced by letrozole and the associated gene expression alterations. Most importantly, our data revealed that down-regulation of several secreted factors (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1 etc.) in CAFs might be partially responsible for the efficacy of letrozole. ",

        "title": "Elucidating the fate of nanoparticles among key cell components of the tumor microenvironment for promoting cancer nanotechnology.",
        "content": "Successful integration of nanotechnology into the current paradigm of cancer therapy requires proper understanding of the interface between nanoparticles (NPs) and cancer cells, as well as other key components within the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as normal fibroblasts (FBs) and cancer-associated FBs (CAFs). So far, much focus has been on cancer cells, but FBs and CAFs also play a critical role: FBs suppress the tumor growth while CAFs promote it. It is not yet known how NPs interact with FBs and CAFs compared to cancer cells. Hence, our goal was to elucidate the extent of NP uptake, retention, and toxicity in cancer cells, FBs, and CAFs to further understand the\u00a0fate of NPs in a real tumor-like environment. The outcome of this would guide designing of NP-based delivery systems to fully exploit the TME for a better therapeutic outcome. We used gold nanoparticles as our model NP system due to their numerous applications in cancer therapy, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 were chosen as cancer cell lines. For this study, a clinically feasible 0.2\u00a0nM concentration of GNPs was employed.

So far, much focus has been on cancer cells, but FBs and CAFs also play a critical role: FBs suppress the tumor growth while CAFs promote it. It is not yet known how NPs interact with FBs and CAFs compared to cancer cells. Hence, our goal was to elucidate the extent of NP uptake, retention, and toxicity in cancer cells, FBs, and CAFs to further understand the\u00a0fate of NPs in a real tumor-like environment. The outcome of this would guide designing of NP-based delivery systems to fully exploit the TME for a better therapeutic outcome. We used gold nanoparticles as our model NP system due to their numerous applications in cancer therapy, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 were chosen as cancer cell lines. For this study, a clinically feasible 0.2\u00a0nM concentration of GNPs was employed. According to our results, the cancer cells and CAFs had over 25- and 10-fold higher NP uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. Further, the cancer cells and CAFs had over 30% higher NP retention compared to FBs. There was no observed significant toxicity due to GNPs in all the cell lines studied. Higher uptake and retention of NPs in cancer cells and CAFs vs FBs is very important in promoting NP-based applications in cancer therapy. Our results show potential in modulating uptake and retention of GNPs among key components of TME, in an effort to develop NP-based strategies to suppress the tumor growth. An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs. Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs.

The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

It is well established that tumour stroma plays critical roles in controlling breast cancer epithelial cell behaviour, and therefore in defining cancer outcomes. Tumour stroma includes fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, adipocytes, and blood and lymph vessels, but the fibroblasts are typically most abundant and have consequently attracted most attention. Gene expression profiles of these carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) differ substantially from their normal tissue counterparts, although considerable heterogeneity is evident within CAF populations. Studies have identified specific molecules, such as transforming growth factor \u03b2, hepatocyte growth factor, stromal cell-derived factor-1 and phosphatase and tensin homologue, that are expressed by CAFs and regulate carcinoma cell behaviour, typically leading to enhanced tumourigenicity. Studies have also identified gene regulatory events that are responsible for the deregulation of such molecules in CAFs, including changes in promoter methylation, the activity of key transcription factors, and even\u2014controversially\u2014somatic mutations in critical signalling molecules. However, the contributions of microRNAs (miRNAs) to gene deregulation in CAFs are virtually unknown.MiRNAs are a class of more than 1000 non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of up to 60% of genes. They act by binding to mRNAs, usually within 3\u2032 untranslated regions, causing post-transcriptional down-regulation of protein expression by translational repression and/or mRNA destabilization. Many studies have demonstrated deregulation of specific miRNAs in breast cancer and the potential functional consequences within epithelial cancer cells. Thus, specific miRNAs can themselves be regarded as \u2018tumour suppressors\u2019 or \u2018oncogenes\u2019. Examples include miR-10a, miR-373, and miR-21, which act as regulators of growth, invasion, and metastasis. Interestingly, there is some evidence that miR-21, which is up-regulated in breast cancers and was assumed to be functional within epithelial cells, is in fact predominantly expressed in fibroblasts. Very recently, attention has been given to miRNA roles in the fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, with the first report profiling miRNA expression differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs). We examined these differences in great detail and investigated the functional impacts on CAFs of the most consistently deregulated miRNA that we identified, miR-26b.Materials and methodsEthics, tissue, and laser micro-dissection (LMD)Ethical approval was obtained (Leeds East REC 06/Q1206/180). LMD was performed using a Zeiss/PALM Microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) from formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue as described in the Supplementary materials and methods. CAFs were defined as fibroblasts present within tumour masses (as in refs 21 and 22), and less than 2\u2009mm from tumour cells, while NFs were defined by their association with normal epithelium more than 1\u2009cm outside tumour masses. Areas selected were devoid of visible cells other than target cell types. SMA staining [mouse monoclonal; M851 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), 1 : 1000] was performed using an IntelliPATH automated stainer (Menarini, Florence, Italy) and the manufacturer's standard conditions.Tissue culture, transfection, transduction, and functional assaysMCF7 and HB2 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Stable GFP expression was conferred by pTH-GFPa, a selectable GFP expression vector. MCF7 cells that stably express firefly luciferase were obtained from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA, USA; #AKR-234). Primary fibroblasts were isolated from breast surgical samples and immortalized by hTERT retroviral transduction as described previously. Reverse transfection of pre-/anti-miR (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and/or plasmids was performed using HiPerFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Stable miR-26b/control \u2018knock-down\u2019 was performed using pmiRZIP lentiviral vectors (System Biosciences, Mountain View, USA). Assays for cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were performed as described previously. Flow-cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were performed on LSRII (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and MoFlo (Dako) machines, respectively. Spheroid invasion assays were carried out using modifications of a previously described method. Spheroids were formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded, and 5\u2009\u00b5m sections stained with haematoxylin/eosin, or treated for immunohistochemistry (rabbit anti-cytokeratin, Ab9377; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; see ref 28) as above. Dual luciferase assays and pmiRGLO reporter were used (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.RNA extraction, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and microarray analysesRecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation for FFPE (Ambion) was used for RNA extraction from FFPE. MirVana miRNA Isolation (Ambion) and RNeasy (Qiagen) were used for extraction from cell lines of miRNA and mRNA, respectively. qPCR analyses were performed on 7500/7900HT machines in triplicate with Taqman assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Microarray analyses of miRNA expression were performed using human miRNA v2 arrays and system v1.7 reagents (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Further details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.Protein mass spectrometryPeptides from processed lysates of cell pellets were separated by capillary liquid chromatography (LC) and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using the RSLCnano system and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The data search against the IPI Human 3.87 database and label-free quantitation (LFQ) were performed using MaxQuant 1.2.2.5. Further details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) with two-tailed tests described in the text. Mass spectrometry data were analysed using R (OSX v2.15.1); expression levels were log2 median-normalized and analysed using t-tests, and p values converted to false discovery rates using Benjamini\u2013Hochberg methodology.ResultsMiRNA expression in breast NFs differs from that in CAFsWe compared the miRNA profiles of breast NFs with those of CAFs using two sources of cells: (i) fibroblasts isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using laser micro-dissection (LMD); and (ii) a tissue culture model in which breast fibroblasts were combined with either non-transformed breast epithelial cells or breast cancer epithelial cells.To validate our LMD protocols, we first prepared samples enriched for either epithelial cells or stromal fibroblasts from tissue blocks of a single breast cancer case [luminal A subtype, (ER+/her2\u2212)] and from matched normal breast tissue. Figure 1A shows representative LMD sections; fibroblast-enriched samples are referred to as fibroblast-enriched stroma (F). Tumour sections were stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA), demonstrating that the majority of CAFs were SMA-positive (Figure 1B). MiRNAs were extracted from LMD samples and microarrays were used to determine expression profiles. Of the 723 miRNAs analysed, 229 (32%) were detected in at least one sample. Many miRNAs were detected in fibroblast-enriched stroma that were not detected in epithelial cells from the same tissue (normal tissue: 86; cancer tissue: 68; Figure 1B), demonstrating that LMD had successfully allowed enrichment for separate cell populations and that the fibroblast-enriched stroma and epithelial miRNA profiles differed. Very few epithelial-specific miRNAs were identified (normal tissue: 3; cancer tissue: 7; Figure 1B). We then examined differential expression between normal and cancer as determined in fibroblast-enriched stroma or epithelial samples (Figure 1C). Seventy-six and 26 miRNAs were found to be down- or up-regulated, respectively, in both epithelium and fibroblast-enriched stroma, indicating some commonality between miRNA deregulation in these breast cancer compartments. A large number of miRNAs were found to be deregulated solely within fibroblast-enriched stroma (77 down; 82 up), while epithelial cell-specific deregulation was relatively rare (14 down; 16 up).Laser micro-dissection (LMD) allowed analysis of miRNA deregulation in the fibroblast and epithelial cell compartments of breast cancers. (A) Representative images of breast cancer tissue before (left) and after (right) LMD of fibroblast-enriched stroma or epithelial cells as labelled. FFPE breast tissue was sectioned and stained with toluidine blue. Regions for LMD were identified based on morphology. (B) Representative images of tumour sections stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA) using immunohistochemistry. (C, D) Total RNA was extracted from at least 5\u2009mm2 of LMD tissue enriched for fibroblasts or epithelial cells from breast cancer tissue or from matched normal breast tissue. Microarray analyses of miRNA expression were performed. (C) Numbers of miRNAs detected in only samples of fibroblast-enriched stroma (F), in both samples of fibroblast-enriched stroma and epithelial cells (F and E), or in only epithelial cell samples (E) are shown for each tissue. (D) Relative expression of each miRNA was compared between normal and cancer tissue within fibroblast-enriched stroma (F) or within epithelial cells (E). Numbers of individual miRNAs that were up- or down-regulated in those compartments are displayed in Venn diagrams showing how many were deregulated in common between compartments (the intersects), or were deregulated in one compartment only.MiRNA expression was also examined in a tissue culture model. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were co-cultured with either HB2 cells, breast epithelial cells of non-cancer origin considered to represent normal epithelium, or MCF7 cells, representative of epithelial cells of the most common breast cancer subtype (luminal A). Epithelial cell lines were stably labelled with GFP in order to allow their separate analysis within co-cultures. Fibroblasts had a potent and differential effect on the growth of the two epithelial cell types; the growth of MCF7 cancer cells was stimulated more than five-fold by fibroblasts, while the growth of HB2 cells was not altered (Figure 2). Thus, fibroblasts within the fibroblast/MCF7 co-culture behaved in a manner analogous to CAFs, while those within the fibroblast/HB2 co-culture exhibited less functional cross-talk. Fibroblasts were co-cultured with HB2 or MCF7 cells for 9\u2009days before being isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. MiRNA expression within these fibroblasts was examined using microarrays. Two hundred and twenty-six (31%) of the 723 miRNAs analysed were detected in at least one sample. One hundred and sixty-six miRNAs were expressed at lower levels, and 60 miRNAs were more highly expressed in the fibroblasts when they were cultured with MCF7 cancer cells (the CAF model), compared with those cultured with benign HB2 cells (the NF model).Growth of MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells, but not non-transformed \u2018normal\u2019 HB2 breast epithelial cells, was stimulated by immortalized breast fibroblasts. GFP-labelled MCF7 breast cancer cells (A) or HB2 benign breast epithelial cells (B) were co-cultured with immortalized breast fibroblasts (pictured), or were cultured alone, and epithelial cell growth was monitored by counting GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry for up to 10\u2009days. Data are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments.Next, we identified miRNAs that were consistently differentially expressed both between NFs and CAFs from clinical samples and between the tissue culture model \u2018NFs\u2019 and \u2018CAFs\u2019 (complete dataset\u2014Supplementary Data 1). One hundred and four miRNAs were down-regulated and ten miRNAs were up-regulated in CAFs in both assays (see Supplementary Data 2), representing a remarkably high degree of overlap (eg 69% of LMD-identified down-regulations were also seen in tissue culture, while 63% of tissue culture-identified down-regulations were also seen using LMD). Candidate miRNAs were further filtered using a cut-off of fold changes greater than 10 in both assays, which left six miRNAs that showed consistent and substantial down-regulation (Table1).Six miRNAs are consistently down-regulated more than ten-fold in breast CAFs compared with breast NFs in both tissues (comparing matched NF-enriched stroma and CAF-enriched stroma prepared by LMD; Figure 1) and a co-culture model [comparing immortalized breast fibroblasts co-cultured either with the benign breast epithelial cell line HB2 (representing NFs) or with the breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 (representing CAFs); Figure 2]. \u2018GeoMean fold change\u2019 is the Geomean of the fold change in tissues and in the co-culture modelMiRNA\tRegulation\tFold change (tissues)\tFold change (co-culture)\tGeoMean fold change\t \tMiR-7f\tDown\t47.6\t10.2\t22\t \tLet-7\u2009g\tDown\t15\t11.4\t13\t \tMiR-107\tDown\t13.1\t11.5\t12.3\t \tMiR-15b\tDown\t14.2\t10.8\t12.4\t \tMiR-26b\tDown\t21\t49.3\t32.2\t \tMiR-30b\tDown\t12.3\t30.2\t19.3\t \tMiR-26b is down-regulated in breast cancer CAFsMiR-26b was examined further as it showed the greatest mean fold change (Table1). Further samples enriched for NFs or CAFs were prepared by LMD from archival tissue blocks representing an additional 14 sequential cases of luminal A subtype breast cancers (defined as ER+/her2\u2212). MiR-26b expression was quantified using qPCR (Figure 3A). MiR-26b was down-regulated in CAF-enriched stroma compared with NF-enriched stroma in 11/14 cases (Figure 3A; Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank p\u2009=\u20090.04). We also examined miR-26b expression in matched primary cultures of NFs and CAFs isolated from four more breast cancer cases; miR-26b was down-regulated in CAFs in all cases (Figure 3B). Therefore, we found miR-26b to be down-regulated in CAFs in 15/18 cases in our validation cohort. Supplementary Table 1 shows the clinical features of this cohort.MiR-26b expression was frequently down-regulated in CAFs compared with matched NFs. (A) Samples enriched for fibroblasts were isolated by LMD from samples of matched breast cancer and normal tissue from 14 sequential cases of luminal A breast cancer (see Supplementary Table 1). (B) Primary cultures of matched NFs and CAFs were established from four further breast cancer cases. qPCR was used to analyse miR-26b expression relative to the geometric mean RNU6B and RNU48. Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error).Reduced miR-26b activity in fibroblasts inhibits growth but enhances migration and invasionWe examined whether manipulation of miR-26b levels resulted in changes in fibroblast behaviour. Firstly, we transiently transfected immortalized breast fibroblasts with anti-miR-26b or control molecules. We used qPCR to assess the degrees of miR-26b knock-down in these transfections. MiR-26b expression was reduced by more than three-fold (Figure 4A; p\u2009=\u20090.03), although it is worth noting that this may under-represent the reduction in miR-26b function since some miR-26b molecules detected may have been functionally sequestered in the cells by anti-miR-26b molecules. Transient knock-down of miR-26b caused a small but statistically significant reduction in fibroblast growth (Figure 4B; p\u2009=\u20090.02 at 48\u2009h). We also measured the migration of anti-miR-26b or control transfected fibroblasts using trans-well assays. Migration was significantly increased by more than three-fold by anti-miR-26b transfection (Figure 4C; p\u2009=\u20090.008). We also investigated the consequences of miR-26b overexpression by transiently transfecting fibroblasts with pre-miR-26b or control molecules. MiR-26b overexpression caused dramatic and rapid cell death (Supplementary Figure 1), as has been observed previously in colorectal cancer cells. However, qPCR analyses revealed that miR-26b was overexpressed by more than 1000-fold in these transfections (Supplementary Figure 1C). We believe that this lacks clinical relevance since this degree of overexpression greatly exceeded differential miR-26b expression in matched NFs and CAFs (Figure 3); therefore, we did not proceed with further overexpression studies.Transient miR-26b down-regulation in breast fibroblasts inhibited growth but stimulated migration. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were transiently transfected with anti-miR-26b molecules or with control anti-miRs. (A) MiR-26b expression was quantified 24\u2009h after transfection using qPCR (relative to RNU6B). Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments. (B) Cell growth was monitored by MTT assays over 72\u2009h. (C) Migration of fibroblasts was assessed 24\u2009h after transfection using trans-well migration assays by manual counting of cells that had passed through the membranes. Data in B and C are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments.To study the consequences of reduced miR-26b function, we stably knocked down miR-26b in breast fibroblasts using lentiviral vectors (which also conferred GFP expression). Fibroblasts were stably transduced to reduce miR-26b function (designated \u201826bk/d\u2019), or were transduced with control virus (designated \u2018controlk/d\u2019), and flow cytometry was used to enrich populations to maintain more than 90% transduced cells (GFP-positive). A two-fold reduction in miR-26b expression was observed by qPCR (Figure 5A; p\u2009=\u20090.02). As before, we were conscious that this might not accurately reflect functional knock-down; we therefore also performed luciferase reporter assays to assess miR-26b function. A single, fully complementary miR-26b binding site was cloned downstream of the luciferase reading frame in a reporter, and 26bk/d or controlk/d cells were transfected with the reporter. Luciferase assays demonstrated that 26bk/d cells allowed two-fold higher expression of a miR-26b target (Figure 5B; p\u2009=\u20090.001), indicative of reduced miR-26b function. We also examined the influences of miR-26b knock-down on cell growth/viability by both monitoring the growth of 26bk/d and controlk/d cells (Figure 5C) and examining their cell cycle distributions (Figure 5D). In accordance with our previous findings (Figure 4A), we found that 26bk/d cells grew slightly more slowly than controlk/d cells (p\u2009=\u20090.01 at 72\u2009h). This appeared to relate to a cell cycle defect represented by an increase in cells in the G2/M phase (Figure 5D; p\u2009=\u20090.02). However, these growth and cell cycle defects are minor and may lack biological relevance. Next, we examined the migratory or invasive capacities of 26bk/d and controlk/d cells using scratch-closure and trans-well migration assays, or trans-well Matrigel invasion assays. 26bk/d cells showed increased migration in scratch-closure assays, although this fell just short of statistical significance (Figure 5E; p\u2009=\u20090.06). However, 26bk/d cells demonstrated significantly enhanced migration and invasion in trans-well assays (Figure 5F, p\u2009=\u20090.001; Figure 5G, p\u2009=\u20090.03). A second independent immortalized breast fibroblast line was also transduced to knock down miR-26b (designated \u201826bk/d2\u2019) or was control transduced (designated \u2018controlk/d2\u2019); this also demonstrated significantly enhanced migration and invasion after miR-26b knock-down (Figure 5F, p\u2009=\u20090.02; Figure 5G, p\u2009=\u20090.02). We concluded that breast fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b, as seen in CAFs, exhibited reduced growth but increased motility and invasive capabilities.Stable down-regulation of miR-26b in breast fibroblasts inhibited growth but stimulated both migration and invasion. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were stably transduced to knock down miR-26b (26k/d) or with a control construct (conk/d). (A) MiR-26b expression was quantified in the two cell lines using qPCR (relative to RNU6B). Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments. (B) MiR-26b function was assessed as ratios of firefly to Renilla luciferase expression using a miR-26b target luciferase reporter (containing a perfect miR-26b binding site downstream of firefly luciferase and also coding for Renilla luciferase as an internal control). Cell lines were transfected with the reporter and dual luciferase assays were performed after 24\u2009h. (C) Cell growth in the two cell lines was monitored using MTT assays over 72\u2009h after initial seeding of equal numbers of cells. (D) Proportions of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined in sub-confluent cultures using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. (E) Migration was determined in scratch-closure assays using digital imaging as the percentage scratch area remaining 18\u2009h after scratch formation. Representative images are shown immediately after forming the scratch and at 18\u2009h. (F) Migration was determined in trans-well assays by manual counting of cells that had passed through the membrane. A representative example of the trans-well migration result is shown. A second independent breast fibroblast line was also stably transduced (26k/d2 and conk/d2). Cells having migrated through the membranes were counted at 12\u2009h for 26k/d and conk/d and at 24\u2009h for 26k/d2 and conk/d2 (the second pair of transduced fibroblast lines migrated/invaded more slowly, reflecting variation between individual parental fibroblasts). (G) Invasion was assessed using trans-well assays by manual counting (at the same time points as F). Data in B\u2013G are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate (B, D\u2013G) or triplicate (C) experiments.Reduced miR-26b activity in fibroblasts enhances migration/invasion of epithelial cancer cellsWe were especially interested to determine whether miR-26b in breast fibroblasts could modify epithelial cancer cell behaviour. We co-cultured either 26bk/d or controlk/d fibroblasts with MCF7 epithelial cancer cells. We used MCF7 cells that stably express luciferase in order to quantify them separately within co-cultures. As expected, the presence of fibroblasts enhanced MCF7 growth (see Figure 2), but 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts did not have differential influences (Figure 6A). This experiment was performed seeding epithelial cells and fibroblasts at a ratio of 1 : 3 in accordance with published literature; differential influences of 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts on epithelial growth were also not seen at other ratios (Supplementary Figure 2). Next, migration and invasion assays were performed with MCF7/fibroblast co-cultures (seeding ratios of 1 : 3). In trans-well assays, MCF7 cells demonstrated significantly enhanced migration in the presence of 26bk/d fibroblasts (Figure 6B; p\u2009=\u20090.008), although a trend for enhanced invasion fell short of statistical significance (Figure 6C). This enhanced migration of MCF7 cells was not reproduced when the fibroblasts were seeded separately in the lower chambers of the trans-wells (Supplementary Figure 3). Invasion assays were also performed using three-dimensional spheroids, which better reflect in vivo interactions between cells and the microenvironment. MCF7 cells were aggregated with 26bk/d or controlk/d fibroblasts, or with each of the second pair of transduced fibroblasts, 26bk/d2 or controlk/d2, before being encased in collagen-I/Matrigel matrix and incubated for up to 48\u2009h. Invasion into the matrix of large groups of cells was dramatically enhanced by the 26bk/d fibroblasts (Figure 6D; p\u2009=\u20090.01) compared with controls; indeed, these outgrowths were absent in the presence of one control line. These striking outgrowths were characterized in more detail by staining with haematoxylin and eosin (Figure 6E) or for epithelial cytokeratins (Figure 6F). Outgrowths contained predominantly epithelial cells (based on morphology and positive cytokeratin expression; labelled \u2018e\u2019) with some internal fibroblasts (based on morphology and/or negative cytokeratin expression; labelled \u2018f1\u2019). Fibroblasts were mainly visible on the external surface of outgrowths (labelled \u2018f2\u2019) and radiating through the matrix from the spheroid (labelled \u2018f3\u2019).MCF7 cell migration and invasion are stimulated by breast fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b. MCF7 cells (luciferase-positive) were co-cultured with miR-26b knock-down (26k/d) or with control (conk/d) breast fibroblasts (seeding ratio of one epithelial cell to three fibroblasts). (A) MCF7 cell growth was monitored within co-cultures using luciferase assays over 72\u2009h (entire co-cultures were lysed and luciferase activity, present within the epithelial cells only, was quantified). (B, C) Migration or invasion of MCF7 cells within co-cultures was assessed 24\u2009h after seeding in trans-well assays using luciferase assays (cells having passed through the membrane were lysed and luciferase activity was quantified within the lysates). (D) MCF7 cells and fibroblasts were aggregated, forming three-dimensional spheroids, and were suspended in a collagen-I/Matrigel matrix for up to 48\u2009h. Invasion of MCF7 cells away from the central spheroid was quantified as shown at 48\u2009h. Assays were performed with 26k/d or conk/d fibroblasts and with equivalent lines derived from an independent breast fibroblast line (line 2). (E, F) Spheroids were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were taken and stained using haematoxylin and eosin (E) or for epithelial cytokeratins (F). Scale bars (top right of each image)\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00b5m. Epithelial cells (cobblestone morphology/cytokeratin-positive) are labelled \u2018e\u2019, while populations of fibroblasts (elongated morphology/cytokeratin-negative) are labelled \u2018f1\u2019 (internal to spheroid outgrowth), \u2018f2\u2019 (surface of outgrowth), and \u2018f3\u2019 (within matrix radiating from spheroid). Data are means of at least biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate (B\u2013D) or triplicate (A) experiments.MiR-26b regulates multiple molecular pathways in breast fibroblastsOur next aim was to determine the molecular pathways responsible for the altered behaviour of 26bk/d fibroblasts. Initially, we identified potential direct miR-26b targets using bioinformatics (TargetScan; http://www.targetscan.org); these predictions suggested that miR-26b might target more than 100 different transcripts. In order to identify pathways altered in breast fibroblasts, we carried out proteomic comparisons of 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts. Label-free protein mass spectrometry was performed on triplicate flasks of both cell types (dataset\u2014Supplementary Data 3). As expected, expressions in the triplicates were highly related, with mean Spearman's rho coefficients for pairwise comparisons between triplicates of 0.83 and 0.85 for 26bk/d and controlk/d cells, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We identified proteins that were significantly differentially expressed between the lines. Three hundred and sixty proteins (of a total of 3369 detected) were differentially expressed (Student's t-test; p\u2009<\u20090.05). When multiple testing was taken into account using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1, this was reduced to 11 proteins (Table2). In order to determine molecular pathways that were deregulated in 26bk/d cells, we subjected the protein lists to gene ontology analyses (ToppGene Suite; http://toppgene.cchmc.org/). The list of 360 proteins was significantly enriched for genes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle (nine genes from 35 in the genome; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and in cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases (14 from 72; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Supplementary Table 2). For identification of potential direct miR-26b targets, we limited our analyses to changes in expression identified at an FDR of less than 0.1. We examined whether the 11 differentially expressed proteins were predicted miR-26b targets and whether this correlated with up- or down-regulation; up-regulation in 26bk/d cells was expected for direct miR-26b targets. Five proteins were up-regulated in 26bk/d cells, three of which were predicted targets, while six were down-regulated, none of which were predicted targets (Table2). This distribution of predicted targets supports the conclusion that these three predictions are true direct targets. These are tankyrase 1 binding protein 1 (TNKS1BP1), cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 7 (CPSF7), and collagen type XII alpha 1 (COL12A1). The functional relevance of these three molecules was examined further by mining publicly available data. Expression data are available for 53 breast cancers from which cancer stroma was isolated by LMD and stromal mRNA expression levels were profiled using expression arrays. We tested whether stromal expression of TNKS1BP1, CPSF7 or COL12A1 was associated with differences in time to recurrence. Expression was dichotomized using Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis in order to allow Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses of groups with high and low expression. For each gene, high expression, as seen in 26bk/d cells, was significantly associated with increased rates of recurrence (Figure 7; log rank, TNKS1BP1 p\u2009=\u20090.002, CPSF7 p\u2009=\u20090.007, COL12A1 p\u2009=\u20090.043), implicating them, and by inference miR-26b, as stromal determinants of breast cancer outcome.Proteins differentially expressed between controlk/d and 26k/d fibroblasts (false discovery rate\u2009<\u20090.1). Immortalized breast fibroblasts were virally transduced to reduce expression of miR-26b (26k/d) or were control transduced (controlk/d). Label-free quantitative protein mass spectrometry was performed on triplicate flasks of the two cell lines. Fold changes were calculated using mean expression levels in triplicate controlk/d samples and triplicate 26k/d samplesGene\tRegulation/protein fold change*\tPredicted target\t \tTMEM119\tDown\tNo\t \tNUDCD3\tDown\tNo\t \tTPM2\tDown\tNo\t \tFAM3C\tDown\tNo\t \tCLTB\tDown\tNo\t \tTHOC5\tDown\tNo\t \tUSP19\tUp\tNo\t \tAPIP\tUp\tNo\t \tTNKS1BP1\tUp/3.32\tYes\t \tCPSF7\tUp/4.35\tYes\t \tCOL12A1\tUp/7.20\tYes\t \tFold changes are shown only when the protein was detected in both cell lines\u2013when it was not detected in either line, only the direction of deregulation is indicated.Stromal expression of inferred miR-26b targets predicts breast cancer recurrence. Correlations between high and low (as defined using ROC analyses) stromal expression of TNKS1BP1, CPSF7 or COL12A1 and breast cancer recurrence were tested using Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses, using publicly available mRNA expression array data from laser capture micro-dissected stromal breast cancer tissue from 53 breast cancers, mined using the Oncomine platform (https://www.oncomine.org).DiscussionCAFs are known to differ from NFs in their expression profiles and, consequently, in their behaviour and influences on epithelial cancer cells. However, the molecular basis of these expression differences is poorly understood, with signalling from cancer and other stromal cells, as well as epigenetic deregulation, implicated as key influences. We examined whether miRNA expression differs substantially between NFs and CAFs and whether these differences regulate fibroblast behaviour. We focused on miR-26b, since it was deregulated (down-regulated in CAFs) to the greatest extent in our screens (Table1). Down-regulation of miR-26b has been observed previously in various cancers, including glioma, head/neck/oral cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and breast cancer, and has generally correlated with higher grade or more aggressive cancer types. This conclusion is supported by the fact that low miR-26b expression correlated significantly with poor cancer survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, and in breast cancer in our analysis of publicly available miRNA expression data (Supplementary Figure 4). It should be emphasized that all of these studies analysed expression in cell populations that included both cancer and stromal cells; therefore it is not possible to be certain of the cell type in which miR-26b is expressed and functional. An exception to this is a recent analysis of miRNA expression in six paired primary cultures of NFs and CAFs from breast cancers, in which miR-26b was identified as down-regulated in CAFs, in accordance with our findings, although it is important to note that this study included no assessments of the function or targets of miR-26b.At least 14 different direct targets for miR-26b have been suggested in the literature (see Supplementary Table 3) in a range of other cell types and supported by differing levels of proof. The vast majority of these potential target proteins were not detected in our proteomic analyses, but those that were showed no evidence of significant differential expression between 26bk/d and controlk/d cells. This is compatible with the suggestion that miR-26b targets multiple transcripts and that these vary with cell type. We identified three miR-26b targets in breast fibroblasts and established that their expression in this compartment was significantly associated with survival from breast cancer (Figure 7). These molecules are functionally diverse: TNKS1BP1 is involved in telomere maintenance; CPSF7 regulates polyadenylation; and COL12A1 is an extracellular matrix component. This diversity hints at the potential for miR-26b to have broad-ranging influences on cellular physiology, as has been seen with some other miRNAs. Importantly in this context, we analysed downstream effects of manipulating miR-26b at a wider proteome level. We identified two significantly deregulated pathways: glycolysis/TCA cycle; and cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases. For glycolysis/TCA, all genes were up-regulated in 26bk/d fibroblasts and they included enzymes that catalyse five of the nine main steps of glycolysis. Similar up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes has recently been reported in bladder cancer stroma. These observations are potentially compatible with the \u2018reverse Warburg effect\u2019, as described by Lisanti and co-workers, in which CAFs carry out aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate and pyruvate that are used, in part, by neighbouring cancer cells. However, published work suggests that this results in enhanced cancer cell growth, which we did not find (Figure 6A), rather than the enhanced cancer cell migration/invasion that we saw (Figures 6B\u20136F). With respect to the second pathway, the influences of Rho GTPases on cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility are well established. Notably, Rho signalling has been implicated in CAF-mediated remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, leading to enhanced invasion of cancer cells, a model discussed further below.We have shown that reduced miR-26b can enhance breast fibroblast migration and invasion (Figures 4 and 5) and that this, in turn, can stimulate migration and invasion of epithelial cancer cells in the context of epithelial/fibroblast co-cultures (Figure 6). At least two models have been proposed to explain this stromal\u2013epithelial cross-talk. Firstly, fibroblasts secrete soluble paracrine factors that stimulate epithelial migration/invasion directly. Secondly, fibroblasts modify the structural microenvironment, making it more permissive for epithelial migration/invasion. From our data, we believe that a soluble paracrine factor that acts directly on the epithelial cells is less likely, since we were unable to recapitulate the influence of 26bk/d fibroblasts on epithelial cells when the cells were physically separated in culture (Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore, our preferred model is one that involves modification of the structural microenvironment. Potentially, enhanced epithelial invasion could be a passive phenomenon where epithelial invasion occurs simply by following the passage of fibroblasts through the matrix, making use of the \u2018holes\u2019 that remain behind the fibroblasts; in this case, fibroblasts would be simply removing the barrier of the matrix that inhibits epithelial movement. However, our data indicate that the fibroblasts' influence is more complex. 26bk/d fibroblasts significantly stimulated the migration of epithelial cells in trans-wells lacking matrix, where there was no barrier for the fibroblasts to remove and no matrix in which fibroblasts could leave these \u2018holes\u2019 (Figure 6B). In addition, controlk/d fibroblasts invaded from spheroids, albeit to a lesser degree than 26bk/d fibroblasts, presumably leaving the \u2018holes\u2019 in the matrix, but epithelial invasion was hardly detectable at all. We interpret this to suggest that active stimulation of epithelial migration/invasion through stimulatory modifications to the matrix is a component of the 26bk/d fibroblasts' influence. Fibroblasts enhance the invasion of squamous cell carcinoma cells in a similar way, with both matrix \u2018holes\u2019 and fibroblast deposition of the matrix components fibronectin and tenascin-C implicated as potential stimulatory mediators of epithelial invasion. In this case, RhoA signalling in the fibroblasts was found to be important for both hole formation and matrix deposition, which correlates with our observation of deregulation of the Rho pathway. The roles of fibronectin and tenascin-C in stimulating this migration/invasion remain to be fully elucidated. COL12A1 presents a further candidate molecule for roles in making the matrix permissive for migration/invasion as it is known to organize and stabilize matrix fibrils of collagen type I, a main matrix component in our spheroid assay. In addition, increased COL12A1 expression has recently been noted at colorectal cancer invasive fronts, implicating COL12A1 in invasion.Author contribution statementETV, TAH, AMH, and MH designed the experiments and analysed the data.

Here, we characterize four CAF subsets in breast cancer with distinct properties and levels of activation. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a multi-step mechanism. By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4<sup+</supCD25<sup+</sup T lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and\u00a0JAM2. Moreover, CAF-S1 increases T lymphocyte survival and promotes their differentiation into CD25<supHigh</supFOXP3<supHigh</sup, through B7H3, CD73, and DPP4. Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T\u00a0cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation.

        "content": "Human breast tumors are often associated with a fibrotic reaction termed desmoplasia. Tumor cells may indirectly modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by influencing fibroblast properties. They may also directly interact with collagen fibrils leading to retraction of the matrix. We have studied in vitro the influence of various human mammary tumor cells on the proliferation rate of normal human fibroblasts and on their level of collagen synthesis, as well as their release of collagenase activity. Interactions between neoplastic cells and collagen matrix were investigated by incorporation of tumor cells in collagen gels (lattices) and measurement of their retraction. All cells tested (HBL100, SW613, SA52, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, MCF7/6, MCF7 ras, BT20 and T47D) were able to modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by one or several of the mechanisms investigated. Our results also demonstrate an opposite regulation of collagen and collagenase production. The effects on the collagen metabolism and on fibroblast proliferation are probably mediated by soluble cytokines since they are reproduced by incubating the fibroblasts in the presence of medium conditioned by tumor cells. The desmoplastic reaction may thus result from different mechanisms dependent upon tumor cell types.",

Functionalized nanocages (HFn-FAP) have significantly higher binding with FAP<sup+</sup CAFs than with FAP<sup-</sup cancer cells. We loaded HFn-FAP with navitoclax (Nav), an experimental Bcl-2 inhibitor pro-apoptotic drug, whose clinical development is limited by its strong hydrophobicity and toxicity. We showed that Nav is efficiently loaded into HFn (HNav), maintaining its mechanism of action. Incubating Nav-loaded functionalized nanocages (HNav-FAP) with FAP<sup+</sup cells, we found significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to non-functionalized HNav. This was correlated with a significantly higher drug release only in FAP<sup+</sup cells, confirming the specific targeting ability of functionalized HFn. Finally, we showed that HFn-FAP is able to reach the tumor and to target CAFs in a mouse syngeneic model of triple negative breast cancer after intravenous administration.

We loaded HFn-FAP with navitoclax (Nav), an experimental Bcl-2 inhibitor pro-apoptotic drug, whose clinical development is limited by its strong hydrophobicity and toxicity. We showed that Nav is efficiently loaded into HFn (HNav), maintaining its mechanism of action. Incubating Nav-loaded functionalized nanocages (HNav-FAP) with FAP+ cells, we found significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to non-functionalized HNav. This was correlated with a significantly higher drug release only in FAP+ cells, confirming the specific targeting ability of functionalized HFn. Finally, we showed that HFn-FAP is able to reach the tumor and to target CAFs in a mouse syngeneic model of triple negative breast cancer after intravenous administration. Our data show that HNav-FAP could be a promising tool to enhance specific drug delivery into CAFs, thus opening new therapeutic possibilities focused on tumor microenvironment.1. IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

This metabolic phenomenon is known as the \u2018Warburg effect\u2019. Although aerobic glycolysis is a more inefficient process compared to oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells compensate for this by increasing their rate of glucose flux. The increased aerobic glycolysis results in accumulation of lactate both inside and outside of the tumor cells, i.e., in the extracellular tumor microenvironment. In addition, stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment can also contribute to the accumulation of lactate and thereby exposing tumor cells to a high lactate concentrations. Clinically, the lactate concentration in tumors has been estimated to be as high as 40 mM compared to the physiologic normal range of 0.5\u20132 mM.Both \u03b2-catenin-dependent and \u03b2-catenin-independent WNT signaling have been implicated as mediators of cancer cell metabolism. In breast cancer cells, \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling induces aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer via down-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase, thereby suppressing mitochondrial respiration. c-Myc, a transcriptional target of WNT \u03b2-catenin signaling, is known to upregulate key rate-limiting glycolytic genes, e.g., GLUT-1, LDH and PKM2, thereby stimulating aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. These findings are in accordance with the demonstrated role of \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling in the development and progression of breast cancer. In addition, there is direct and indirect evidence that suggests an essential role of \u03b2-catenin-independent WNT signaling in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism. The WNT5A ligand may accomplish its effect on cancer cell metabolism directly or by antagonizing \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling. The latter mechanism has been shown to be a part of its role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer.WNT5A is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to specific receptor/co-receptor complexes to initiate intracellular signaling cascades that results in regulation of different cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Distinct expression of WNT5A has been reported in various cancers. In breast cancer, loss of WNT5A expression has been associated with early relapse and unfavorable prognosis. A similar tumor suppressive role of WNT5A has also been suggested in colon cancer and prostate cancer. In contrast, WNT5A has a tumor-promoting role in melanoma where it has been shown to escalate cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting melanoma metastasis. Recently, Sherwood et al. demonstrated that WNT5A can reprogram tumor cells and that these effects are diverse and context dependent. For example, in contrast to melanoma cells, WNT5A-treated breast cancer cells do not respond with an increase in aerobic glycolysis but instead with a significant increase in their oxygen consumption rate (OCR).Consequently, based on the previous report by Sherwood et al., we expanded the metabolic investigation of the consequences of WNT5A signaling in two metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) in the present study. We first transfected both breast cancer cell lines with a WNT5A plasmid to study the long-term effects of WNT5A signaling in an environment that mimics in vivo conditions. We also stimulated the breast cancer cells lines with recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A) and Foxy5, a WNT5A-mimic peptide that is presently in a clinical phase 1b study. Our present findings revealed the mechanisms whereby WNT5A signaling reduces lactate production and the uptake of lactate from the extracellular microenvironment, and they also demonstrated that the WNT5A-induced metabolic changes are essential for its ability to impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Due to the inhibition of breast cancer cell migration, even in the presence of extracellular lactate, the WNT5A-mimic peptide, Foxy5, is implicated as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of extremely glycolytic and aggressive breast cancers.RESULTSWNT5A signaling inhibits lactate production and cell migration without affecting cell proliferationPreviously, Sherwood et al. demonstrated that WNT5A signaling positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in melanomas, thereby making melanoma cells more migratory and invasive. In the same study, the authors\u2019 also demonstrated that rWNTA-treated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells show induced oxidative phosphorylation but no changes in lactate secretion. In the present study, we performed a more thorough investigation of the role of WNT5A signaling on aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells using several different approaches. Although rWNT5A clearly triggers WNT5A signaling in breast cancer cells, the stability of rWNT5A in cell culture conditions remains unknown. A potential variability in the concentration of rWNT5A might affect its regulation of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, to address this problem, we transfected two metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) with a WNT5A plasmid as these cells have no endogenous WNT5A expression (Supplementary Figure 1). Both breast cancer cell lines expressing the WNT5A plasmid (MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) showed significant decreases in lactate production after 72 h compared to the respective empty vector (EV)-transfected control cells (Figure 1A and 1B). These findings clearly demonstrated that WNT5A signaling inhibits lactate production in breast cancer cells, which is in direct contrast to its effect in melanoma cells. Using the same experimental conditions, we investigated parallel effects on migration and proliferation of the breast cancer cells via Transwell migration and MTT assays. Compared to their respective controls (EV), migration was significantly decreased in WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells (Figure 1C and 1D). Morphologically, WNT5A expressing breast cancer cells exhibited less migration relevant membrane protrusions, as compared to control EV transfected cells (Supplementary Figure 2). WNT5A signaling did not affect breast cancer cell growth (Figure 1E and 1F). These experiments suggested a potential relation between lactate secretion and cell migration in breast cancer cells.WNT5A signaling inhibits lactate production and cell migration but not cell proliferation in breast cancer cellsCell culture media lactate measurements for the (A) MDA-MB-468-5A and (B) MDA-MB-231-5A WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells compared to empty vector-expressing cells at 72 h.

PFK is a complex tetrameric enzyme that exists in three isoforms as follows: liver (PFKL), muscle (PFKM), and platelet (PFKP). To explore the relevance of these PFK isoforms in breast cancer, we investigated how their respective expression related to breast cancer patient survival by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Using online meta-analysis software, gene expression profiles of PFKP, PFKL and PFKM derived from GEO (Affymetrix microarrays only), EGA and TCGA data sets were generated using 1117 breast tumor samples as described by Gyorffy et al.. Of the three PFK isoforms, the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses showed that high PFKP expression correlated with decreased patient survival (HR = 2.01; p = 0.00083), whereas the two other PFK isoforms (PFKL and PFKM) did not (Figure 2A\u20132C). Overall, these results indicate that the expression of PFKP not only relates to the glycolytic activity but also to breast cancer patient prognosis.Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis of PFKP, PKFL, and PKFM in breast cancer patientsKaplan-Meir survival analysis of (A) PFKP, (B) PKFL, and (C) PKFM mRNA in 1117 breast cancer patients with Kaplan-Meier Plotter.

These results made us investigate if these findings occurred simultaneously with a WNT5A-induced altered protein expression of not only PFKP but also of two additional key glycolytic proteins, Hexokinase II (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), in breast cancer cells. We have in the present study focused our interest on the potential roles of enzymes that are designated as critical regulators of glycolysis. However, it is important to underline that this does not exclude contribution of other enzymes in the regulation of lactate production. Using Western blotting, we investigated the expression of HK, PK and PFKP in MDAMB-468-5A cells, as these glycolytic enzymes are crucially involved in the production of lactate and play essential roles in breast cancer progression. Of these three enzymes, only the expression of PFKP was decreased in MDA-MB-468-5A cells as compared to control MDA-MB-468-EV cells (Figure 3A). WNT5A expression significantly reduced PFKP expression in both breast cancer cell lines (i.e., MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) compared to their respective EV-transfected control cells (Figure 3B and 3C). The down-regulation of PFKP, a key glycolytic enzyme, by WNT5A signaling correlates with the ability of WNT5A to decrease lactate secretion in breast cancer cells.WNT5A signaling inhibits PFKP expression in breast cancer cells(A) Representative Western blot showing changes in key glycolytic markers in the MDA-MB-468-5A WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells compared to empty vector-expressing cells (MDA-MB-468-EV).

For siRNA efficiency and specificity experiments, we transiently transfected parental MDA-MB-231 cells with 25, 50 or 100 nM PFKP siRNA for 48 h and analyzed the effects on PFKP expression by Western blotting (Supplementary Figure 3). Of the three concentrations tested, we selected 25 nM for the subsequent experiments. We next examined if PFKP silencing affected lactate production in parental breast cancer cell lines. Both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 25 nM PFKP siRNA, and lactate production was then analyzed after 72 h. Significant reductions in lactate production were observed in both PFKP-silenced breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) as compared to their respective control cells (NC) (Figure 4A and 4B). These results support the notion that the WNT5A-mediated decrease in lactate production in breast cancer cells is due to the WNT5A-induced reduced expression of PFKP protein. To investigate the functional role of PFKP in breast cancer cells, we next investigated how the reduced expression of PFKP affects breast cancer cell migration and invasion. PFKP-silenced MDA-MB-468 (Figure 4C) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4D) cells showed significantly impaired migration compared to their respective controls. For the invasion experiments, we selected the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells over the less invasive MDA-MB-468 cells. In accordance with the migration results, PFKP siRNA treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in significant inhibition of their invading capacity compared to cells treated with negative control (NC) siRNA (Figure 4E). These results indicated that PFKP expression positively regulates not only lactate production but also breast cancer cell migration and invasion.PFKP knockdown inhibits lactate production and impairs breast cancer cell migration and invasionExtracellular lactate measurements in (A) MDA-MB-468 and (B) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transiently transfected with PFKP siRNA compared to control NC siRNA as described in the Materials and Methods section.

We examined the role of \u03b2-catenin signaling for the following two reasons: 1) active \u03b2-catenin signaling positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancers, including breast tumors; and 2) WNT5A expression inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in breast cancer cells, and ERK1/2 signaling has been suggested to activate WNT \u03b2-catenin signaling. Hence, we analyzed the expression of active (non-phosphorylated) \u03b2-catenin in the two WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cell lines. Significant reductions in the expression of active \u03b2-catenin were observed in the cell lysates of both WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cell lines (Figure 5A and 5B) as compared to their respective control EV cells. Moreover, significant inhibition of LEF/TCF reporter activity was found in MDA-MB-468-5A cells compared to MDA-MB-468-EV cells (Figure 5C), thereby indicating that WNT5A signaling impairs \u03b2-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells. To investigate if the WNT5A-mediated inhibition of \u03b2-catenin is mediated through altered ERK1/2 signaling, we next treated the breast cancer cell lines with U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of both MEK1 and MEK2 resulting in impaired ERK signaling (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B). Exposure to U0126 for 24 h reduced active \u03b2-catenin protein expression in parental MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B), demonstrating that \u03b2-catenin is a downstream target of ERK1/2 suggesting that WNT5A-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 activity is a possible cause of its inhibitory effect on \u03b2-catenin in these cells. Alternatively, U0126 might alter the level of P-LRP6 in WNT5A expressing cells and thereby regulate \u03b2-catenin signaling.WNT5A signaling inhibits \u03b2-catenin expression in breast cancer cells(A) Representative Western blots and quantification of non-phospho (Active) \u03b2-catenin protein in MDA MB-468-5A cells compared to MDA-MB-468-EV cells.

For the experiments, we used XAV939, a potent tankyrase (TNKS) inhibitor that antagonizes \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling via stimulation of \u03b2-catenin degradation and stabilization of axin. Treatment of MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 h with XAV939 (10 \u03bcM) resulted in a significant decrease in lactate production as compared to vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells (Supplementary Figure 4C and 4D), demonstrating that \u03b2-catenin signaling positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in these breast cancer cells.We next tested if direct inhibition of \u03b2-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells will result in decreased PFKP protein expression. We treated parental MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells with rWNT5A and XAV939 independently and analyzed PFKP expression by Western blotting. Treatment with either rWNT5A or XAV939 resulted in significant decreases in the expression of active \u03b2-catenin and PFKP in MDA-MB-468 (Figure 6A) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6B) cells. These data suggested that \u03b2-catenin positively regulates PFKP expression and thereby aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells.Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin results in reduced expression of PFKP in breast cancer cellsParental breast cancer cells were treated with recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A; 0.4 \u03bcg/ml) and XAV939 (\u03b2-catenin inhibitor; 10 \u03bcM) for 16 h.

However, in cancer tissue, lactate is not only generated from cancer cells but also from stromal cells in the cancer microenvironment. The presence of stromal-derived lactate in the tumor microenvironment can be imported into cancer cells through the specific lactate transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), and can consequently also regulate migration and invasion of such cancer cells. To study the effects of extracellular lactate on breast cancer cell migration in the absence and presence of WNT5A signaling, we treated breast cancer cells with sodium L-lactate (10 mM) under different conditions and evaluated their migratory responses. A significant increase in migration was found for lactate-treated MDA-MB-468-EV cells as compared to vehicle (water)-treated EV cells (Figure 7A). However, WNT5A-expressing MDA-MB-468 cells did not respond to extracellular lactate treatment, suggesting that WNT5A signaling abolishes the response of breast cancer cells towards extracellular lactate. In search of an underlying mechanism, we next investigated if WNT5A signaling affects the expression of the MCT1 lactate transporter in these cells. We found decreased expression of MCT1 in both MDA-MB-231-5A and MDA-MB-468-5A cells in comparison with their respective empty vector transfected control cells (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 5). As the endogenous expression of MCT1 was very low in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 5) we performed the subsequent experiments in MDA-MB-468 cells. We therefore validated the decreased expression levels of MCT1 in MDA-MB-468-WNT5A cells compared to MDA-MB-468-EV cells and these results suggest that WNT5A signaling inhibits MCT1 expression (Figure 7B). Furthermore, even in the presence of lactate, breast cancer cells expressing WNT5A showed a statistically significant reduced level of MCT1 as compared to lactate treated MDA-MB-468-EV cells (p = 0.006) (Figure 7B).Lactate-induced migration of breast cancer cells is impaired in the presence of WNT5A signaling in MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with WNT5A(A) WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468-5A) and empty vector (MDA-MB-468-EV) cells were treated with 10 mM lactate or vehicle (water) for 48 h and then subjected to transwell migration analysis for the next 24 h. The experiments with WNT5A transfected breast cancer cells were performed for 72 h (end point) to allow sufficient time for secretion of WNT5A. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 4). *p < 0.05, ***p = 0.001. (B) Representative Western blot demonstrating the expression levels of MCT1 in MDA-MB-468 (MDA-MB-468-5A) and empty vector (MDA-MB-468-EV) cells treated with 10 mM lactate or vehicle (left panel). Actin served as a loading control. MCT-1 levels for the experiments were quantified by calculating integrated densitometric values and normalizing them to actin levels (right panel). The experiments were with WNT5A transfected breast cancer cells were performed for 72 h (end point) to allow sufficient time for secretion of WNT5A. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 3). *p < 0.05,**p = 0.01.These findings were further validated in non-transfected parental breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) treated with 10 mM L-lactate either in the absence or presence of rWNT5A or Foxy5 the WNT5A-mimic peptide (Figure 8). In accordance with our previous results (Figure 7), addition of exogenous lactate induced increased migration of both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 parental breast cancer cells, and addition of either rWNT5A (Figure 8A and 8B) or Foxy5 (Figure 8C and 8D) caused a strong inhibition of migratory responses even in the presence of lactate in both cell lines.Lactate-induced migration of breast cancer cells impaired in MDA-MB-468 cells stimulated with rWNT5A or Foxy5(A) MDA-MB-468 and (B) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with 10 mM lactate in the presence or absence of rWNT5A (0.4 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h and then subjected to transwell migration analysis for the next 24 h. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 4). *p < 0.05, **p = 0.01. (C) MDA-MB-468 and (D) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with 10 mM lactate in the presence or absence of Foxy5 (100 \u03bcM) for 24 h and then subjected to transwell migration analysis for the next 24 h. These experiments were performed with parental breast cancer cell lines treated with lactate in the absence or presence of exogenously added recombinant WNT5A (0.4 \u03bcg/ml) or Foxy5 (100 \u03bcM). These experiments were performed for 48 h (endpoint) since we did not have to include time for secretion of WNT5A. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 4). *p < 0.05, **p = 0.01, ***p = 0.001.DISCUSSIONCancer cells favor aerobic glycolysis as they can adjust themselves to fluctuating O2 tensions, while other cells that rely on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP might perish under such conditions. In human breast cancer, the activity of glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, is many fold higher compared to normal tissues. In the current study, we investigated the role of WNT5A signaling in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer. Unlike melanomas in which WNT5A triggers tumor-promoting effects including a positive regulation of aerobic glycolysis, we expected an opposing effect in breast cancer cells where WNT5A is predominantly considered to exert tumor suppressor functions. The breast cancer cell lines used in the present study (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) both lack endogenous expression of WNT5A protein, making them ideal to study the effects of WNT5A signaling via either transfection with a WNT5A plasmid or direct stimulation with rWNT5A or Foxy5, a WNT5A-mimic peptide. Our results demonstrated that WNT5A signaling causes a reduced production of lactate in breast cancer cells in parallel with reduced cellular migration and down-regulation of PFKP. Our investigation also revealed that other isoforms of phosphofructokinase, i.e., PFKL and PFKM, do not play important roles in promoting breast cancer progression as only high PFKP gene expression is associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Using a siRNA knockdown approach, we demonstrated that PFKP plays a crucial role in regulating aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that PFKP-silenced breast cancer cells exhibited reduced lactate production as well as impaired breast cancer cell migration and invasion. In support of our findings, Park et al. demonstrated that the Tat-activating regulatory DNA-binding protein (TARDBP) regulates aerobic glycolysis by regulating PFKP through miR-520, suggesting that PFKP is indeed a key molecule in altering glucose metabolism. Recent studies in which PFKP expression was indirectly increase or decrease either via the ZBTB7A transcriptional repressor or by sorafenib have suggested that PFKP might be a suitable drug target for anti-cancer therapies as inhibition of PFKP represses aerobic glycolysis.The question then arises via what pathway WNT5A decreases the expression of PFKP and thus glycolysis. Based on the findings that WNT5A can reduce \u03b2-catenin activity in colon cancer cells and that \u03b2-catenin signaling induces aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells, we explored the possibility that WNT5A impairs aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells via impaired \u03b2-catenin signaling. For these experiments, we used an anti-active-\u03b2-catenin antibody and found that WNT5A signaling significantly reduced the amount of active-\u03b2-catenin protein in breast cancer cells. The data was further validated by demonstrating reduced LEF/TCF reporter activity in WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells, proposing that WNT5A not only suppresses \u03b2-catenin protein expression but also inhibits its downstream transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells. The present observation that the inhibitor of \u03b2-catenin signaling, XAV939, impairs not only the amount of active \u03b2-catenin but also the expression of PFKP in a manner similar to that of WNT5A signaling supports the idea that WNT5A impairs aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells via reduced \u03b2-catenin signaling. Further support of this comes from the findings that XAV939 impairs both \u03b2-catenin signaling and PFKP expression more efficiently than WNT5A signaling. In support of our results and conclusions, Pate et al. recently demonstrated that XAV939 treatment of colon cancer cells reduces their glucose consumption and lactate production in parallel with a 30\u201340% increase in their oxidative phosphorylation rate.Cancer cells are not the only source of lactate in breast tumor tissue as stromal fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment can also secrete lactate. By culturing mammary stromal cells (RMF-621) in high glucose conditions, Tobar et al. recently demonstrated a metabolic response characterized by induced lactate production in these cells that in turn fuels mammary epithelial growth with significant increase in cell migration and invasion. In accordance with our present results, these authors also showed that lactate treatment alone significantly upregulates the transwell invasion of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Similarly, Bonuccelli et al. demonstrated that L-lactate stimulates MDA-MB-231 cells from metastatic lung lesions compared to control cells, suggesting that lactate drives the metastatic spread of breast cancer cells. As we have shown previously that WNT5A signaling inhibits endogenous migration of breast cancer cells, we next investigated if active WNT5A signaling in breast cancer cells can counteract the effect of extracellular lactate. In the present study, we demonstrated that increased migration induced by extracellular lactate was impaired in WNT5A-transfected breast cancer cells, thereby suggesting that WNT5A might inhibit lactate uptake in breast cancer cells. Our finding that WNT5A signaling inhibits the expression of the key lactate importer, MCT1, suggests a mechanism whereby WNT5A counteracts the effect of extracellular lactate in breast cancer cells and thereby their ability to migrate and disseminate to form metastatic lesions. In support of our present finding that WNT5A impairs the expression of MCT1, inhibition of MCT1 has been shown to impair lactate transport as well as migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. On the basis of our results, we have provided a schematic diagram on how WNT5A signaling regulates aerobic glycolysis and thereby cell migration in breast cancer cells (Figure 9). Finally, our results demonstrating that both rWNT5A and Foxy5 continue to inhibit breast cancer cell migration, even in the presence of extracellular lactate, lends further support for the idea of therapeutically using Foxy5 to impair metastatic spread in the treatment of extremely glycolytic and aggressive breast cancers.Schematic diagram of WNT5A signaling regulation of aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cellsThe present study favors the idea that WNT5A signaling via a \u03b2-catenin-PFKP axis reduces lactate production and decreases the expression of MCT1 (a lactate uptake carrier) in breast cancer cells thereby adding to the ability of WNT5A to impair migration and invasion.Overall, we showed that WNT5A signaling not only inhibits lactate production but also impairs lactate import, thereby inhibiting cell migration. Our study also highlighted the importance of WNT5A, \u03b2-catenin, PFKP and MCT1 in lactate regulation in breast cancer cells, thereby providing a therapeutic window where agonists (such as Foxy5) and antagonists of these molecules can be utilized for breast cancer therapy either alone or in combination.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell linesThe MDA-MB-468 (Lot No. 58483213) and MDA-MB-231 (Lot No. 58629943) human mammary carcinoma cell lines were procured directly from the American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were grown in DMEM (HyClone, Utah, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 U/ml penicillin, 0.5 U/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. The cell lines were frequently screened for mycoplasma contamination using an EZ-PCR kit (HaEmek, Israel).Plasmid and siRNA transfectionsThe pcDNA3.1 (\u00b1)-WNT-5A plasmid or the pcDNA3.1 empty vector were used to transfect the MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells lines as described by Prasad et al.. The stable breast cancer cells expressing WNT-5A (i.e., MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 700 \u03bcg/mL geneticin (G418). Continued WNT-5A expression was verified by Western blot analysis performed on cell lysates and on conditioned cell culture media. Prior to the lactate assay, proliferation assay, migration/or invasion assay, LEF/TCF reporter assay, siRNA transfections and Western blot analysis, the cells were washed with PBS and grown for 48 h in G418-free DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS to condition the media with WNT-5A.For PFKP transient knockdown, sequence-specific siRNAs were used. The smart pool of PFKP siRNA (h) (Cat. no.sc-106401) was procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Texas, USA). The negative control (NC) scrambled sequence #1 siRNA was obtained from Applied Biosystems (CA, USA). Briefly, breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a transfection complex of 25 nM siRNA (final concentration) and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) suspended in serum-free DMEM. After 6 h, the transfection complex was removed, and the cells were replenished with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were then allowed to grow for the next 48 h prior to use for Western blot analysis, lactate assay, migration assay or invasion assay.Western blottingWNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells or parental breast cancer cells treated with PFKP siRNA, rWNT5A, XAV939, U0126 or not were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold phosphorylation lysis buffer (PLB). The protein estimation, SDS-PAGE and visualization procedures were performed as described in Prasad et al.. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-WNT5A from R&D systems (MN, USA); anti-Hexokinase-II, anti-Puruvate Kinase; anti-PKFP, anti-non-phospho (Active) \u03b2-catenin, and anti-pERK1/2 antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA); anti-MCT1 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (TX, USA); and anti-\u03b2-actin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-goat, which were procured from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Separated protein bands were visualized using Chemiluminescence HRP substrate (Millipore), and the membranes were imaged and analyzed using the Chemi Doc\u2122 imaging system from Bio-Rad.Kaplan-meier survival analysisThe Kaplan-Meier-Plotter online software was used to perform meta-analysis-based biomarker prediction as described by Gyorffy et al.. For our analysis, we plotted and calculated overall survival (OS) for breast cancer patients (n = 1117) with respect to expression of all the three isoforms of phosphofructokinase (PFKP, Platelet; PFKL, Liver; and PFKM, Muscle) and WNT5A.Lactate assaySecreted lactate in the cell culture supernatant (from WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells after siRNA PFKP or XAV939 treatment) was measured using the lactate estimation kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the experiments for lactate estimation were performed in low serum conditions.Cell proliferation assayBriefly, WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) were seeded (5.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well) in 12 well plates and were allowed to grow for 72 h. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to assess cell proliferation. MTT solution (25 \u03bcl; 5 mg/ml) was added to each well 6 h prior to the end point. After 72 h, the medium was discarded and DMSO was added to the cells. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega).Transwell migration and invasion assayPFKP siRNA-transfected or L-lactate-treated breast cancer cells were washed and detached with Versene (Gibco\u00ae, NY, USA) and re-suspended as single-cell suspensions in low-serum DMEM (supplemented with 1% FBS). The cell invasion assays were performed in cell culture inserts (PET membrane with 8.0 \u03bcm pore size; Ref# 353097; Corning Incorporated, NC, USA). The cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess\u2122, Invitrogen). A total of 25,000 cells in low-serum DMEM was added to the upper chamber [for rWNT5A treatment, 0.4 \u03bcg/ml rWNT5A was added to the medium], and the lower chamber was filled with 0.7 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to invade for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells in the insert were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. The non-migratory cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton-tipped applicator and were further processed as published by Linnskog et al.. Transwell invasion assays for PFKP siRNA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in a similar manner using BD Matrigel\u2122 invasion chambers (MA, USA) in which 50,000 cells were added to the upper chamber. Statistical analyses were performed by taking those cells into account that have migrated or invaded to the other side of the membrane (outer side). Furthermore, it was checked that the incubation time (24 h) used in these experiments did not allow cells to detach from the membrane into the lower chamber.LEF/TCF reporter assayThe LEF/TCF reporter assay was used to determine \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling activity. A construct containing a promoter with TCF-binding motifs upstream of a Firefly luciferase gene was transfected into the MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-468-EV cells. \u03b2-catenin binding to the TCF motif resulted in the transcription and translation of luciferase and in the emission of a bioluminescence signal. To normalize for transfection efficiency, a CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporter was co-transfected. The luciferase substrates were purchased from Promega (Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter (DLR) Assay, E1910) and automatically added by a dual-injector system according to manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity of cell extracts was measured using a Mini Lumat LB 9506 (Berthold Technologies).ImmunofluorescenceBreast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468-EV & MDA-MB-5A) were grown on 13-mm glass cover-slips for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 3 min, all at room temperature. Next, cells were incubated with Phalloidin-TRITC (1:400; Sigma Aldrich) for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were rinsed with PBS and counter-stained with DAPI (300 nM in PBS) for 2 min. For Confocal imaging (Carl Zeiss LSM 700), the fixed and stained cells were mounted with the Dako Fluorescent Mounting Medium and viewed with a 40\u00d7 objective.Statistical analysisAll the data presented herein are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error. Each of the experiments was repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was throughout performed using two-tailed Student's t-test and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For the lactate production experiments we used unpaired t-test and for the migration and invasion assays we used paired t-test. All of the statistical tests and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (CA, USA).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTTommy Andersson is a shareholder of WNT Research and is the parttime Chief Scientific Officer of WNT Research, but this does not alter the authors\u2019 adherence to all of the policies on sharing data and materials as stated in the guidelines for publication in Oncotarget.

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

F Biodistribution of the DID-labeled liposomes in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at different time points after intravenous injection.

H Semi-quantitative ROI values of mean fluorescence intensity at tumor sites. **p\u2009<\u20090.01; Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of three technical replicates; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01C, D, the glycosyls of Rg3 at the C3-position were oriented towards the water molecules and sticked out of the surface of the liposomal membrane, which could potentially interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Scale bar: 2\u00a0mm. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Unpaired t-test was used for analysis of differences between two groups. Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above.

Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score. The optimal docking conformation was determined based on the docking score and hydrogen bonding interactions. PyMol was utilized to generate the ribbon/surface view of docked complexes.Intracellular uptake assay of the liposomes by 4T1 cells2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well. In Rg3-Lp/C6\u2009+\u2009glucose, Rg3-Lp/C6\u2009+\u2009WZB117 groups, the medium was aspired after 12\u00a0h. 20\u00a0mM glucose solution and 10\u00a0\u03bcM WZB117 was added and incubated with cells for 1\u00a0h, respectively. The cells were then treated with C-Lp loaded with C6 (C-Lp/C6) and Rg3-Lp loaded with C6 (Rg3-Lp/C6) respectively (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL) for 4\u00a0h. The cells were then collected, washed three times with pre-chilled PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Intracellular uptake of liposomes by Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cellsGlut 1 siRNA (5\u2019- CCAACUGGACCUCAAACUUTT -3\u2019) and siRNA mate were mixed in opti-MEM medium to form siRNA complexes. Then siRNA complex was added in cell culture medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 72\u00a0h. Then, C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 was added in the medium respectively for 4\u00a0h (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL).

Then, the medium was aspirated and 200 \u03bcL DMSO was added. After shaking for 30\u00a0min, the optical density (OD) value of each well was measured at 490\u00a0nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Trading Co., Ltd., Switzerland). The cell viability rate was calculated according to the following formula:Control: Untreated cells (viability rate 100%); Blank: (the wells with no cells).Cell apoptosis assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well.

Then the cells were collected and washed with PBS. Next, the cells were further stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. The apoptosis rate of the cells was then analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).At the same time, the 4T1 cells suspension (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105/ mL) was inoculated into 12-well plate with prepared cell sheets (0.1\u00a0ml cell suspension every cell sheet). The drug solution was changed according to the group described before after 24\u00a0h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33,342 and PI after 48\u00a0h of induction, then mounted with glycerol jelly mounting medium and exposed to inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) for qualitative observation and photo taking.Culture and polarization induction of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM)Bone marrow cells were collected from 6\u20138-week old specific pathogen-free male Balb/c mice as described above. Bone marrow cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 20\u00a0ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 96\u00a0h to induce bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) differentiation. Interferon-\u03b3 (20\u00a0ng/mL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500\u00a0ng/mL) were added to the medium for 24\u00a0h to induce the polarization toward M1 phenotype.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-cultured medium after different treatment was then collected.

Sterilize under high pressure for 30\u00a0min. After sterilization, the agarose solution was added to a 96-well plate with 50 \u03bcL per well. The 4T1 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were then digested, mixed and added to a 96-well cell culture plate containing agarose gel at 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL per well respectively. It was placed in a 37\u00b0 C incubator for cultivation. The fluid was changed every other day, and the tumor sphere grew to about 500\u00a0\u03bcm after 10\u00a0days. C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 were then administered, respectively. After incubating for 12\u00a0h, the tumor spheres were washed three times with PBS buffered saline solution, then transferred to a small dish, fluorescence of C6 was observed with CLSM (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) from the top layer of the tumor sphere to the bottom layer, a tomographic scan is performed every 10\u00a0\u03bcm. After the scanning, the penetration depth of the nanoparticles is analyzed and counted by the ZEN software provided by the instrument.Immunofluorescence staining of \u03b1-SMA1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX concentration, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), respectively. 4T1-conditioned medium after different treatment was obtained for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA assay) after 24\u00a0h.

Treatment was initiated at about 7\u00a0days after inoculation. The tumor bearing mice were divided randomly into two groups and were injected intravenously with C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD respectively. In vivo fluorescent images were taken under in vivo imaging system (IVIS) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24\u00a0h after injection. After 24\u00a0h, the mice were killed. Tumors, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys were then collected and imaged under IVIS system.In vivo antitumor efficacyOrthotopic TNBC model was developed by injecting 4T1 cells into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of BALB/c female mice. After 7\u00a0days, the mice were divided randomly into 8 groups (n\u2009=\u20096 per group) and each treated group was injected intravenously with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX (10\u00a0mg/kg of DTX) every 4\u00a0days for 20\u00a0days respectively. The length and width of tumors and the body weight were measured simultaneously. The tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following formula:Length (L) is the longest diameter and width (W) is the shortest diameter perpendicular to length. At Day 20, all mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were harvested for photo imaging and histological examination. For the histological analysis of apoptosis cells and CAFs in tumor tissue, the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and \u03b1-SMA staining of tumor slices was performed and full-scanned, In addition, for the histological analysis of the collagen in tumor tissue, MASSON staining was conducted and five randomly chosen microscopic fields were selected and semi-quantified by ImageJ software.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-CM after different treatment was then collected.

        "content": "Stromal fibroblasts influence the behavior of breast epithelial cells. Fibroblasts derived from normal breast (NAF) inhibit epithelial growth, whereas fibroblasts from breast carcinomas (CAF) have less growth inhibitory capacity and can promote epithelial growth. We sought to identify molecules that are differentially expressed in NAF versus CAF and potentially responsible for their different growth regulatory abilities. To determine the contribution of soluble molecules to fibroblast-epithelial interactions, NAF were grown in 3D, transwell or direct contact co-cultures with MCF10AT epithelial cells. NAF suppressed proliferation of MCF10AT in both direct contact and transwell co-cultures, but this suppression was significantly greater in direct co-cultures, indicating involvement of both soluble and contact factors. Gene expression profiling of early passage fibroblast cultures identified 420 genes that were differentially expressed in NAF versus CAF. Of the eight genes selected for validation by real-time PCR, FIBULIN 1, was overexpressed in NAF, and DICKKOPF 1, NEUREGULIN 1, PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR 2, and TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR were overexpressed in CAF. A higher expression of FIBULIN 1 in normal- than cancer-associated fibroblastic stroma was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of breast tissues. Among breast cancers, stromal expression of Fibulin 1 protein was higher in estrogen receptor alpha-positive cancers and low stromal expression of Fibulin 1 correlated with a higher proliferation of cancer epithelial cells. In conclusion, expression profiling of NAF and CAF cultures identified many genes with potential relevance to fibroblast-epithelial interactions in breast cancer. Furthermore, these early passage fibroblast cultures can be representative of gene expression in stromal fibroblasts in vivo.",

To determine the contribution of soluble molecules to fibroblast\u2013epithelial interactions, NAF were grown in 3D, transwell or direct contact co-cultures with MCF10AT epithelial cells. NAF suppressed proliferation of MCF10AT in both direct contact and transwell co-cultures, but this suppression was significantly greater in direct co-cultures, indicating involvement of both soluble and contact factors. Gene expression profiling of early passage fibroblast cultures identified 420 genes that were differentially expressed in NAF versus CAF. Of the eight genes selected for validation by real-time PCR, FIBULIN 1, was overexpressed in NAF, and DICKKOPF 1, NEUREGULIN 1, PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR 2, and TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR were overexpressed in CAF. A higher expression of FIBULIN 1 in normal- than cancer-associated fibroblastic stroma was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of breast tissues. Among breast cancers, stromal expression of Fibulin 1 protein was higher in estrogen receptor \u03b1-positive cancers and low stromal expression of Fibulin 1 correlated with a higher proliferation of cancer epithelial cells. In conclusion, expression profiling of NAF and CAF cultures identified many genes with potential relevance to fibroblast\u2013epithelial interactions in breast cancer. Furthermore, these early passage fibroblast cultures can be representative of gene expression in stromal fibroblasts in vivo.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12307-008-0017-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionBreast tumorigenesis is a multifaceted process involving molecular and functional alterations in both the stromal and epithelial compartments of the breast. The interaction between these two compartments is important in the tumorigenic process and is rooted in a complex network of molecules belonging to families of growth factors, immunomodulatory factors, steroid hormones, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components and proteases. Several studies indicate that stromal fibroblasts surrounding normal and cancerous breast epithelium exert a modulatory effect on the epithelium, the nature of which is dependent upon the state of the fibroblasts and the epithelium. Specifically, stromal fibroblasts in normal breast serve a protective function and exert inhibitory signals on the growth of normal epithelium, while cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts act more permissively and allow or promote growth of normal and cancer epithelium. In vitro studies with normal-breast associated fibroblasts (NAF) demonstrate that NAF inhibit the growth of the non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, and its more transformed, tumorigenic derivative, MCF10AT. In vivo, admixed NAF exert an inhibitory effect on histologically normal epithelium but also limit cancer development and growth as shown in the MCF10AT xenograft model of proliferative breast disease.Conversely, fibroblasts derived from breast cancer tissues (CAF) possess permissive or promoting abilities for epithelial cell growth both in vitro and in vivo and exhibit molecular and functional characteristics similar to that of activated stromal fibroblasts normally associated with wound healing. In contrast to NAF, CAF proliferate at a higher rate and secrete increased levels of growth factors, ECM proteins and immunomodulatory factors. The ability of CAF to modulate epithelial cell growth is dependent on the phenotype of the corresponding epithelium. As has been previously shown, CAF inhibit the growth of the MCF10A cells in vitro but promote the growth of breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7, in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the biologic effect of CAF is influenced by the molecular and functional properties of the CAF and the responsiveness of the epithelial cells. Only a few specific molecules derived from CAF, such as Stromal Derived Factor 1 and Hepatocyte Growth Factor, have been shown to contribute to the tumorigenic process. Given the complexity of these stromal\u2013epithelial interactions and the molecular heterogeneity of breast cancers, there are likely many more fibroblast-derived molecules important in breast carcinogenesis and cancer progression that remain to be identified.In this work, we identify genes that are differentially expressed in NAF and CAF. These gene products may be associated with a growth inhibitory function of normal breast stroma and a growth permissive or promoting function of breast cancer stroma. Our data also indicate that fibroblast\u2013epithelial interactions involve both insoluble and soluble secreted molecules. Insoluble molecules may be embedded in the ECM or located on cell membranes. Using gene expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR, we identified multiple genes, encoding both soluble and matrix-bound molecules, that are differentially expressed in in vitro cultures of NAF and CAF and that are associated with remodeling of the ECM and/or are secreted proteins that affect the growth of epithelial cells. Additionally, our data confirm that the differential expression of the ECM glycoprotein Fibulin 1 (FBLN1) in NAF and CAF cultures recapitulated expression of FBLN1 in the fibroblastic stroma of histologically normal breast and breast cancer tissues.Materials and MethodsMaintenance of Epithelial Cell Lines and FibroblastsMCF10AT cells (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan) were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium/Ham\u2019s F-12 (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 0.02\u00a0\u03bcg/ml epidermal growth factor (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and 5% horse serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a humidified, 5% CO2, 37\u00b0C incubator.Human breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties and breast cancer resections were isolated and characterized by immunocytochemistry as per Sadlonova et al.. Fibroblasts were subjected to immunocytochemical evaluation with anti-vimentin (mouse IgG1, clone V9; Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA), anti-epithelial membrane antigen (mouse IgG2a, clone ZCE113; Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA), and anti-cytokeratin (CK) 5/CK 8 (mouse IgG1, clone C-50; Neomarkers) as confirmation of their stromal origin (i.e. strong vimentin expression, and absence of epithelial membrane antigen and CK 5/CK 8). Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Oligonucleotide Microarray Hybridization and AnalysisRNA was isolated from subconfluent cultures, passages 2\u20134, of two NAF (isolated by us from two different individuals) and three CAF (two cultures isolated by us from two different individuals and the Hs574T cell line, a CAF purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)) using TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen). Biotinylated cRNA probes were generated from the isolated RNA and hybridized individually to high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (Hu95A array, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization was detected using a streptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin conjugate and quantified with a high-resolution scanner.RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCRRNA was isolated from eight NAF and seven CAF cultures (all isolated by us from different individuals), passages 3\u20136, followed by RNA clean-up with RNeasy\u00ae Minikit columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All RNA samples were subjected to DNase pretreatment prior to cDNA synthesis. RNA was converted into double stranded cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer/probe sets for DICKKOPF 1 (DKK1), FIBULIN 1 (FBLN1), MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE 1 (MMP1), NEUREGULIN 1 (NRG1), PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR-INHIBITOR 2 (PAI2), THROMBOSPONDIN 3 (THBS3), TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR (PLAT), and TISSUE FACTOR PATHWAY INHIBITOR 2 (TFPI2) (TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Assays-on-Demand\u2122, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) interrogated the following sequences: DKK1\u2014Hs00183740_m1, reference sequence NM_012242; FBLN1\u2014Hs00242545_m1, reference sequences NM_001996, NM_006487, NM_006486, NM_006485; FBLN1C\u2014Hs00242546_m1, reference sequences NM_001996; FBLN1D\u2014Hs00972628_m1, reference sequence NM_006486; MMP1\u2014Hs00233958_m1, reference sequence NM_002421; NRG1\u2014Hs00247620_m1, reference sequences NM_004495, NM_013958, NM_013957, NM_013956, NM_013964, NM_013962, NM_013961, NM_013960; PAI2\u2014Hs00234032_m1, reference sequence NM_002575; PLAT\u2014Hs00263492_m1, reference sequences NM_033011, NM_000931, NM_000930; THBS3\u2014Hs00200157_m1, reference sequence NM_007112; TFPI2\u2014Hs00197918_m1, reference sequence NM_006528.Sequences for the ribosomal S9 primer/probe set follow: F-5\u2032 ATCCGCCAGCGCCATA 3\u2032, R-5\u2032 TCAATGTGCTTCTGGGAATCC 3\u2032, probe-5\u2032 6FAMAGCAGGTGGTGAACATCCCGTCCTTTAMRA 3\u2032.Each culture was assayed in triplicate and each reaction contained 1\u00a0\u03bcl cDNA, 12.5\u00a0\u03bcl 2\u00d7 TaqMan\u00ae Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.25\u00a0\u03bcl TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Assays-on-Demand\u2122 primer/probe set for each target. Fluorescent signal data was collected by the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. Ribosomal S9 was used as the internal reference and was selected because it exhibits minimal variability in tissues of different origins. The standard curve method was employed to determine relative expression levels of each gene.Measuring Proliferation of MCF10AT Cells Grown with Fibroblasts in 3D Direct and Transwell Co-culturesIn 3D direct and transwell co-cultures, the ratio of epithelial cells to fibroblasts was 2:1. Cells were grown in serum free medium and plated on a layer of Growth-Factor-Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), as previously described. For 3D direct cultures, cells were grown in eight-well chamber slides following the protocol in Sadlonova et al. For transwell experiments, MCF10AT cells and fibroblasts were grown in separate compartments with the epithelial cells plated in the Matrigel-coated well and the fibroblasts in the Matrigel-coated insert (0.4\u00a0\u03bcM pore size, polyester, Corning Costar, Lowell, MA). Cultures were incubated in a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 14\u00a0days. To label proliferating cells, 0.2\u00a0mg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was applied to all cultures for 24\u00a0h. BrdU-labeled cells were counted by flow cytometry, as previously described. Briefly, MCF10AT cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-BrdU (mouse IgG1, clone B44, BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). In direct co-cultures, MCF10AT cells were distinguished from fibroblasts by labeling with an allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-EpCAM (mouse IgG1, clone EBA-1; BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). Negative controls included staining with FITC-conjugated IgG1 (mouse IgG1, \u03ba isotype control, BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Cells were analyzed on a BD FACS Calibur\u2122 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the percentage of BrdU-FITC positive MCF10AT cells was calculated.Immunohistochemistry for FBLN1, Estrogen Receptor and Ki-67Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers (n\u2009=\u200935), corresponding uninvolved breast tissue (n\u2009=\u200932) and tissue from breast reduction specimens (n\u2009=\u20097) were obtained from the archives of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Pathology and clinical information was obtained from the Department of Surgery after Institutional Review Board Approval. Our methods of performing immunohistochemistry have been reported in the literature. For estrogen receptor (ER) and Ki-67 staining, sections (5\u00a0\u03bcm thick) were subjected to low temperature antigen retrieval with enzymatic pretreatment, which consists of pre-digestion in 0.1% trypsin (Type II-S from porcine pancreas, Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in phosphate buffered saline for 15\u00a0min in a 37\u00b0C oven followed by incubation in 10\u00a0mM citrate buffer, pH\u00a06, for 0\u00a0h at 80\u00b0C, as previously described. Sections for FBLN1 staining did not require antigen retrieval. All sections were incubated with an aqueous solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5\u00a0min followed by incubation with 1% goat serum. Sections were incubated with two monoclonal antibodies to FLBN1 (clone B-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA at 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml or clone A311, from the laboratory of Scott Argraves, at 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml), a monoclonal antibody to ER\u03b1 (clone ER88, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, at 1:30 dilution (0.33\u00a0mg/ml total protein)) or a monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, Biogenex, San Ramon, CA, at 1:30 dilution (0.37\u00a0mg/ml total protein)) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (pH\u00a07.6) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1\u00a0mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and 1.5\u00a0mM sodium azide for one hour at room temperature. This was followed by secondary detection with a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase system (Signet Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine was utilized as the chromogen. Negative control slides, without addition of primary antibody, were also prepared.All immunohistochemical stains were examined and scored by two of the authors (ARF and AS) concurrently. To semi-quantify FBLN1 immunostaining, a scoring system based on both staining intensity and percentage of cells or area stained was utilized, as previously described. In this system, the intensity of staining is graded from 0 (no staining) to 4 (greatest staining possible). The proportion of cells/area staining at each intensity is multiplied by the corresponding intensity value and these products are added to obtain an immunostaining score (immunoscore) ranging from 0 to 4. For ER\u03b1 and Ki-67, the percentage of cancer epithelial cells with nuclear staining was quantified.Statistical AnalysisMicroarray array images were processed to extract expression quantification with MAS 5 using the Affymetrix GCOS software. High-Dimensional-Biology-Statistics (HDBStat!; Department of Biostatistics, University of Alabama at Birmingham) was used for analysis of the gene expression data, including quantile\u2013quantile normalization, quality control and comparison of gene expression. Genes determined to be differentially expressed and chosen for validation had a fold difference of at least 2.5 and a p value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 by the equal variance t test. The percentage of BrdU and Ki-67 positive cells, real-time PCR expression values and tumor size were compared by the t test for unequal variances. The proportion of patients with positive lymph nodes in FBLN1 low versus high breast cancers was compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test. Immunohistochemical scores for FBLN1 were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank two sample test or the Mann Whitney test, as appropriate.ResultsGene Expression Profiling of NAF and CAF Revealed Many Differentially Expressed GenesWe have previously shown that NAF have a greater ability to inhibit epithelial cell growth than CAF in direct contact co-cultures. To identify molecules through which NAF may inhibit epithelial growth to a greater extent than CAF, the gene expression profiles of NAF and CAF were compared. Affymetrix Hu95A arrays interrogating approximately 10,000 full length genes were used to compare gene expression. Early passage NAF (two cultures) and CAF (three cultures) were used. Each of the fibroblast cultures were from a different individual. The comparison of mean expression in NAF versus CAF yielded 420 genes that were differentially expressed with a p value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 and at least a 2.5-fold difference in expression level. Of the 420 differentially expressed genes, 180 were overexpressed in NAF and 240 overexpressed in CAF (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).NAF Suppressed Proliferation of MCF10AT Epithelial Cells Through Soluble and Insoluble FactorsProliferation of MCF10AT in 3D direct and transwell co-cultures with NAF. Direct and transwell 3D (i.e., in Matrigel) co-cultures of MCF10AT cells with each of three NAF from different individuals were prepared. BrdU labeling of MCF10AT cells was counted by flow cytometry. Each NAF (i.e., NAF1, NAF2 and NAF3) suppressed proliferation of co-cultured MCF10AT cells to some extent in transwell co-cultures, and two of the three NAF (i.e., NAF1 and NAF3) suppressed proliferation of MCF10AT in direct co-cultures. When comparing the overall reduction in proliferation of MCF10AT induced by the three NAF in all transwell co-cultures combined (n\u2009=\u200910, checkered bar) to MCF10AT grown without co-cultured NAF (black bar), the decrease in proliferation was significant (p\u2009=\u20090.011). Similarly, the overall decrease in proliferation induced by the three NAF in all direct co-cultures combined (n\u2009=\u200914, checkered bar) compared to MCF10AT monocultures (black bar) was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, the degree of suppression was significantly greater in direct than transwell co-cultures (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Data are normalized to corresponding MCF10AT monocultures. Mean and standard error are shownTo assist us in selecting genes identified as differentially expressed by expression microarray for validation, we wanted to know if both soluble and insoluble secreted factors were important in the growth inhibition of epithelial cells induced by NAF. To determine this, we prepared 3D transwell and direct co-cultures of MCF10AT epithelial cells and NAF. Transwell co-cultures allow assessment of soluble secreted molecules that can traverse the filter to influence cells in a paracrine manner. In direct co-cultures, the roles of both soluble secreted molecules and insoluble molecules, such as matrix- or membrane-bound molecules that depend on direct contact between cells or between cells and the ECM, can be analyzed. In transwell co-cultures, the mean percentage of MCF10AT cells labeled by BrdU (i.e., BrdU labeling index) was decreased by 20% in co-culture with NAF (p\u2009=\u20090.011). The NAF utilized were derived from three different individuals. In direct co-cultures, the mean reduction in BrdU labeling by the same three NAF was 46% (p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a01). There was variability among the three NAF in their ability to inhibit proliferation of MCF10AT, particularly in direct contact co-cultures. The greater reduction in proliferation of MCF10AT in direct versus transwell co-culture was significant (p\u2009=\u20090.04) (Fig.\u00a01). These results indicate that inhibition of epithelial growth by NAF is mediated by a mixture of direct-contact/insoluble and soluble factors. Therefore, we selected differentially expressed genes from the microarray analysis encoding both soluble and matrix-bound, insoluble molecules for validation by quantitative, real-time PCR (QRT).  Expression of a Subset of Differentially Expressed Genes was Confirmed by Real-Time PCRResults of expression array analysis and QRT of genes selected for validation. a Graphical presentation of expression array data for the eight significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) differentially expressed genes selected for QRT validation. Mean expression of two NAF and three CAF cultures is presented relative to the expression in NAF (NAF expression\u2009=\u20091). b Expression of selected genes as assessed by QRT in eight NAF and seven CAF cultures. Mean expression and standard deviation are presented relative to expression in NAF. Significant differences in expression in NAF and CAF were found for FBLN1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), DKK1 (p\u2009=\u20090.033), NRG1 (p\u2009=\u20090.043), PAI2 (p\u2009=\u20090.002), and PLAT (p\u2009=\u20090.037), indicated by asterisks\nWe selected eight genes from the list of 420 differentially expressed genes in NAF and CAF for validation by QRT (Fig.\u00a02a, Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). The primary criterion for selecting genes for validation was that they encoded a secreted protein, either soluble or matrix-bound, that was known to regulate cell growth, migration, invasion and/or ECM remodeling. Among those selected, some genes had a high fold expression ratio (PAI2 and TFPI2 with a 51\u201352-fold CAF/NAF expression), a medium fold ratio (DKK1 and MMP1 with a 9\u201310 fold CAF/NAF expression), and a lower fold ratio (NRG1 and PLAT with a 4-fold CAF/NAF expression; FBLN1 and THBS3 with a 4\u20135 fold NAF/CAF expression). For validation by QRT analysis, early passage NAF and CAF derived from eight and seven different individuals, respectively, were used.  Two genes overexpressed in NAF cultures were selected for validation: the ECM protein FBLN1 (5.4 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.011) and the ECM glycoprotein THBS3 (4.1 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.014) (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplemental Table 1). Of these two genes, FBLN1 expression was confirmed to be higher among NAF cultures compared to CAF cultures by QRT (Fig.\u00a02b). No difference in expression was detected between NAF and CAF for THBS3 (Fig.\u00a02b).Six genes overexpressed in CAF were selected for validation: the Wnt antagonist DKK1 (9.8 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.002), MMP1 (10.3 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.016), NRG1 (4.1 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.010), TFPI2 (51.5 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.001), which is involved in the regulation of coagulation, and two members of the plasminogen activating/plasmin system\u2014PAI2 (also known as SERPINB2, 52.2 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.015) and PLAT (also known as tPA, 4.2 fold greater, p\u2009=\u20090.041) (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplemental Table 1). In the QRT validation analysis, the expressi\\on of DKK1, NRG1, PAI2, and PLAT was confirmed to be higher in CAF cultures (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a02b). The expression of MMP1 was also found to be higher in CAF than NAF, but this difference reached only borderline statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.065) (Fig.\u00a02b). There was no difference in expression of TFPI2 in NAF and CAF. Therefore, FBLN1, DKK1, NRG1, PAI2, and PLAT were confirmed to be differentially expressed in NAF and CAF by QRT.Expression of FBLN1 Was Reduced in Breast Cancer StromaImmunostaining for FBLN1. a FBLN1 expression by immunohistochemistry with either A311 or B-5 antibody is lower in the stroma of breast cancers (n\u2009=\u200932) than in the stroma of corresponding benign breast (n\u2009=\u200932) from the same individual (p\u2009<\u20090.001 and p\u2009=\u20090.047 for antibodies A311 or B-5, respectively). Expression in the stroma of benign breast (from breast cancer resection specimens) and in normal breast (from mammoplasty specimens) (n\u2009=\u20097) is similar. Expression of FBLN1 is greater in cancer epithelium than benign epithelium with the A311 antibody (p\u2009=\u20090.002. The mean immunoscore and standard error are shown. b Immunohistochemical staining of one breast cancer and corresponding benign breast demonstrating greater staining of stroma (S) (both extracellular matrix and fibroblasts) surrounding epithelial structures in benign breast than in breast cancer. In this particular case, immunostaining is greater in cancer epithelium (E) than in benign epithelium with both antibodies. (bar\u2009=\u200950\u00a0\u03bcm)To identify genes differentially expressed in NAF and CAF, we used in vitro cultures of fibroblasts isolated from breast tissues. We used early passages of these cells in an attempt to reduce changes in gene expression induced by cell culture. However, gene expression can differ in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether any of the expression differences in NAF and CAF identified in vitro are reflective of expression in breast tissues ex vivo, expression of FBLN1 in the fibroblastic stroma (fibroblasts and ECM) surrounding breast epithelium was assessed by immunohistochemistry in cancers and corresponding benign, histologically normal breast from breast cancer resection specimens and in normal breast tissue from breast reduction specimens (Fig.\u00a03b). We selected FBLN1 for further validation because (1) it has been reported to suppress the growth and motility cancer cells, (2) the fold difference in expression between NAF and CAF was relatively high (Fig.\u00a02b), and (3) antibodies suitable for use in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were readily available. Two different monoclonal antibodies to FBLN1 were used, A311 and B-5. Both antibodies identify all documented splice variants and recognize epitopes located at the N-terminus of FBLN1 protein.

The histologic sections of benign breast selected for analysis were derived from an area of the breast not immediately adjacent to the breast cancers. The immunostaining was semi-quantified using a scoring system that combines the number of cells or area stained and the intensity of the staining. This scoring system has been used by us and others previously. Stroma surrounding histologically normal breast epithelium and within breast cancers was immunoscored. The mean immunoscore for FBLN1 was significantly higher in stromal fibroblasts and associated ECM in benign breast than in cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts and ECM when using either antibody A311 (p\u2009=\u20090.001) or antibody B-5 (p\u2009=\u20090.047) (Fig.\u00a03a). Of the 32 breast cancer and benign tissue pairs, FBLN1 expression was higher in benign stroma than cancer-associated stroma in 75% and 63% of cases immunostained with antibody A311 and antibody B-5, respectively (Table\u00a01). Because the NAF cultures were derived from the breasts of women without cancer, we also assessed expression of FBLN1 in breast reduction specimens. The mean immunoscore was similar in the fibroblastic stroma of the normal breast in reduction specimens and the benign tissue from breast cancer patients, stained with either antibody (Fig.\u00a03a). These results indicate that expression of FBLN1 is reduced in CAF in vitro and in the fibroblastic stroma of breast cancer ex vivo.  We also noted that the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in some breast cancers stained more strongly than the epithelium in the histologically normal counterpart. The normal or benign epithelium did not stain with the B-5 antibody, whereas there was cytoplasmic staining of epithelium using the A311 antibody (Fig.\u00a03b). With the A311 antibody, the mean immunoscore of the benign ductolobular epithelium in cancer resection specimens was 3-fold lower than in the corresponding cancer epithelium (p\u2009=\u20090.002). A similar result with the A311 antibody was previously reported. The epithelium of five breast cancers stained with the B-5 antibody, but there was no significant difference in staining between benign and cancer epithelium (p\u2009=\u20090.082) (Fig.\u00a03a).The Ratio of Expression of FBLN1 Isoforms did not Differ in NAF and CAF CulturesExpression of FBLN1 isoforms in NAF and CAF cultures. Expression of FBLN1C and FBLN1D was assessed by QRT using isoform-specific primer/probe sets in all eight NAF and seven CAF. Expression of FBLN1C and FBLN1D was lower in CAF than NAF (p\u2009=\u20090.008 and p\u2009=\u20090.011, respectively, marked by asterisks). Furthermore, the ratio of FBLN1C to FBLN1D did not differ in NAF and CAF. The mean and standard deviation are shownThere are four different splice variants of FBLN1 named A, B, C and D. Only FBLN1C and FBLN1D have been detected in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Furthermore, it has been reported that the ratio of mRNA expression of FBLN1C to FBLN1D is increased in breast cancers in comparison to corresponding normal breast. Additionally, expression of FBLN1C is induced by estrogen, which suggests a potential mechanism for the increased expression of FBLN1C in breast cancer. To determine whether there was a similar increase in the ratio of FBLN1C to 1D in CAF compared to NAF, we assessed expression of FBLN1C and FBLN1D in the NAF and CAF cultures by QRT. Expression of both FBLN1C and FBLN1D isoforms was significantly lower in CAF than NAF (p\u2009=\u20090.008 and p\u2009=\u20090.011, respectively), and the ratio of 1C to 1D was similar in NAF and CAF (Fig.\u00a04). Because all FBLN1 antibodies available recognized both fibulin isoforms, we were unable to compare isoform expression in the stroma of the breast tissues by immunohistochemistry.  Expression of FBLN1 is Higher in Estrogen Receptor-Positive than Estrogen Receptor-Negative CarcinomasComparison of FBLN1 immunoscores in ER\u03b1-positive and -negative breast cancers. FBLN1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 35 breast cancers. Nineteen were ER\u03b1-negative, 14 were ER\u03b1-positive and the ER status was unknown in two. Expression of FBLN1 was higher in the fibroblastic stroma of ER\u03b1-positive cancers than ER\u03b1-negative cancers, but this was statistically significant with antibody A311 (p\u2009=\u20090.032) only. The difference in FBLN1 expression in the epithelium of ER\u03b1-positive versus -negative cancers was not statistically significant.

Thirty-five breast cancers (the 32 cancers with corresponding normal breast plus three additional cancers without corresponding normal breast) were divided into ER\u03b1-positive and -negative subtypes, based on a the percentage of cells with nuclei that stained for ER\u03b1 (i.e., less than 10%\u2009=\u2009ER\u03b1 negative). Clinical and pathologic information related to these 35 cancers is summarized in Table\u00a02. The immunoscores for FBLN1 were compared between ER\u03b1-positive and -negative carcinomas. Using the A311 antibody, FBLN1 in the stroma was significantly higher in ER\u03b1-positive than -negative cancers (p\u2009=\u20090.032, Fig.\u00a05). The mean FBLN1 immunoscore in cancer stroma with the B-5 antibody was also higher in ER\u03b1-positive cancers, but this did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.097). Similarly, the mean FBLN1 immunoscore in cancer epithelium with either the A311 or B-5 antibody was higher in ER\u03b1-positive cancers, but this was not statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.307 and p\u2009=\u20090.167, respectively) (Fig.\u00a05). These findings further support an association between FBLN1 expression, particularly in the stroma, and the presence of ER\u03b1 in cancer epithelial cells.   Higher Expression of FBLN1 in Fibroblastic Stroma is Associated with Lower Rates of Cancer ProliferationProliferation, tumor size, and lymph node status in breast cancers with lower versus higher FBLN1 expression. Thirty-five breast cancers were assessed for FBLN1 expression by immunohistochemistry using antibody A311 or B-5. Cancers were divided into lower versus higher FBLN1 expression in stroma or epithelium based on the mean immunoscore for stromal or epithelial expression with each antibody (i.e., mean FBLN1 immunoscore was 0.74 for stromal expression with A311, 1.19 for stromal expression with B-5, 0.37 for epithelial expression with A311, and 0.08 for epithelial expression with B-5) (as in Fig. 3). a Proliferation, as measured by Ki-67 labeling of cancer epithelial cells, was lower in cancers with higher stromal expression of FBLN1, but this was statistically significant only with the A311 antibody (p\u2009=\u20090.034). There was no significant difference in proliferation in cancer with higher versus lower epithelial expression of FBLN1. b, c There was no difference in tumor size (b) or the percentage of patients with positive lymph nodes (c) in breast cancers with higher versus lower stromal or epithelial FBLN1FBLN1 has been demonstrated to inhibit in vitro adhesion and motility of various cancer cell lines, including breast cancer, and to suppress the growth of human fibrosarcoma cells. Therefore, its loss in breast cancer stroma may allow enhanced growth and invasion of cancer cells. We compared proliferation of cancer epithelial cells in breast cancers with higher versus lower expression of FBLN1 in both stroma and epithelium. The mean FBLN1 immunoscore for each antibody in cancer stroma or epithelium was used as the corresponding cut-off value for higher versus lower expression. Proliferation was determined by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67. In general, the rate of proliferation (i.e., the percentage of epithelial cells labeled by Ki-67) was lower in breast cancers with higher stromal FBLN1 expression (Fig.\u00a06a). However, this difference was only statistically significant for stromal FBLN1 assessed with the A311 antibody (p\u2009=\u20090.034), but not with the B-5 antibody (p\u2009=\u20090.178) and not for epithelial FBLN1 with either antibody (A311, p\u2009=\u20090.468; B-5, p\u2009=\u20090.173). To determine whether there was any correlation between FBLN1 expression in breast cancers and other indicators of invasiveness and growth (i.e., tumor size and lymph node metastasis) of the breast cancers, we compared these parameters in cancers with higher versus lower FBLN1 immunoscores in stroma or epithelium with both antibodies. There was no significant difference in tumor size or the percentage of patients with lymph node metastases in FBLN1 higher versus FBLN1 lower (stromal or epithelial expression) cancers (Fig.\u00a06b,c).  DiscussionThe vast array of molecules involved in breast stromal\u2013epithelial interactions makes it difficult to identify dominant molecules affecting breast cancer initiation and progression. The ambiguity of the spatial and temporal origin of carcinogenesis-related functional and molecular alterations adds another layer of complexity. Even though these alterations have been identified in both stromal and epithelial compartments early in the carcinogenic process, it is still unclear which compartment is affected first\u2014the epithelium, stroma or both of them simultaneously. These complex issues emphasize a need for additional assessment of the molecular and functional signatures of fibroblasts in normal and cancerous tissues that can eventually expand our understanding of the role of fibroblast\u2013epithelial interactions in cancer.Results from the current study complement our previous work demonstrating that NAF have a greater inhibitory effect on the proliferation of breast epithelial cells than CAF. We now show that both soluble and matrix- or membrane-bound molecules are important for the inhibitory signal. The greater inhibition of epithelial growth by NAF in direct co-cultures is likely a result of the closer proximity of epithelial cells and fibroblasts allowing for direct contact between different cell types and their ECM. However, significant inhibition of epithelial cell growth by NAF in transwell cultures indicates that soluble secreted factors are also important. Therefore, our selection of differentially expressed genes for validation included soluble secreted factors, ECM-bound proteins and molecules that contribute to remodeling of the ECM.Remodeling of the ECM is characteristic of the stromal response to cancer, contributes to the tumor microenvironment and results in molecular alterations that affect cancer behavior. In CAF, we observed significant overexpression of several molecules involved in ECM remodeling\u2014PAI2 and PLAT. PAI2 inhibits ECM remodeling by inhibiting urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), while PLAT activates a variety of proteins embedded in the ECM by cleaving plasminogen to plasmin and thereby promoting tissue degeneration and ECM remodeling. Overexpression of TFPI2 in CAF was not confirmed by QRT, but TFPI2 is an inhibitor of coagulation and is proposed to be a maintenance factor of ECM remodeling. Our results indicate a borderline increase in MMP1. MMP1 breaks down collagens and other ECM components and has been reported to be expressed at a higher level in breast cancers, but primarily in cancer epithelial cells rather than stromal fibroblasts. However, stromal-derived MMP-1 has been shown to increase breast cancer cell migration and invasion by cleaving protease-activated receptor 1.Of the two ECM proteins chosen for validation (FBLN1 and THBS3), only FBLN1 was found to be differentially expressed. FBLN1 inhibits in vitro adhesion and motility of various carcinoma cell lines. THBS3 was recently detected in a small number of breast tumors. However, the function of THBS3 is not well defined and this is the first account of THBS3 expression in breast fibroblasts.Each of the soluble secreted factors chosen for validation, DKK1 and NRG1, were found to be differentially expressed. The Wnt signaling pathway contributes to mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. DKK1 is an antagonist of Wnt signaling and may play an anti-tumorigenic role. However, expression of DKK1 was recently found to be increased in breast cancer cell lines with the ability to metastasize to bone and in the serum of breast cancer patients with bone metastasis. NRG1 is an EGF-like signaling molecule that binds to transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors of the ErbB family and governs the ductal differentiation of the mammary epithelium. Recent studies demonstrated that it was capable of activating the ErbB2 oncoprotein in breast cancer cells, and NRG1 overexpression in transgenic mice lead to increased breast tumor formation. Therefore, overexpression of these secreted molecules by CAF may enhance breast cancer epithelial cell growth and metastasis.The extent to which the gene expression profiles of in vitro cultured fibroblasts reflect their gene expression in vivo is not well defined. It is likely that components of the molecular signatures of NAF and CAF are lost during the isolation process and growth in vitro. However, it has been found that the expression of some molecules, such as SMA, in myofibroblasts remains unchanged after multiple subcultures. This persistence of expression may be specific only to some molecules, while for others, expression is more context-dependent and changes when placed in vitro. We demonstrated that expression of one gene, FBLN1, was higher in NAF than CAF cultures in vitro and, correspondingly, in stromal fibroblasts and their ECM in normal breast than in breast cancer ex vivo. Therefore, in vitro breast fibroblast cultures can accurately represent expression of some molecules in stromal fibroblasts of the breast in vivo.We did not find an increase in the ratio of FBLN1C to FBLN1D in NAF and CAF, as has been reported for breast cancers in general. Because FBLN1C expression is induced by estrogen through ER\u03b1, the overexpression of FBLN1C in breast cancers may be limited to the ER\u03b1-expressing epithelial component, rather than the stroma. ER\u03b1 has only rarely been detected in adult stromal fibroblasts of the breast, and this expression is not detectable by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, we did find a correlation between the stromal expression of FBLN1 and ER\u03b1 in cancer epithelial cells, suggesting that paracrine factors produced by ER\u03b1 positive epithelial cells may increase FBLN1 expression in stromal fibroblasts.FBLN1 reduces the adhesion and motility of breast cancer cells in vitro and the growth of fibrosarcomas in a mouse xenograft model. Therefore, decreased FBLN1 in breast cancer stroma may provide a microenvironment that is more conducive to epithelial cell growth and migration than stroma in normal breast. In support of this possibility, cancers with higher FBLN1 in breast stroma had a lower rate of epithelial proliferation than did cancers with lower stromal FBLN1. This relationship is confounded by the lower rate of proliferation of ER\u03b1-positive carcinomas. In the 35 breast cancers studied here, the percentage of Ki-67 labeled cells was 46% in the ER\u03b1-negative cancers compared to 16% in the ER\u03b1-positive cancers. The observed increase in epithelial proliferation in cancers with lower stromal FBLN1, however, did not correlate with the clinical data in our study in that there were no differences in tumor size or lymph node status in breast cancers with lower versus higher stromal expression of FBLN1. As has been previously described, epithelial expression of FBLN1, as assessed with the A311 antibody, was significantly greater in breast cancers than in normal epithelium in our study.Electronic supplementary materialBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The relative mRNA levels obtained by qRT-PCR were used to calculate the normalized log2 ratios. The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against CTGF (1:1000, ab209780), \u03b1-SMA (1:5000, ab124964), FAP (1:1000, ab207178) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, TA-10), and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, ZB-2301) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, ZB-2305) antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate was used to visualize the blots with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit. The total protein concentration was also examined, and then the concentrations of secreted protein of different samples were normalized to corresponding total protein.Lentiviral TransductionThe pLV-EF1\u03b1-CTGF-CMV-Puro lentiviral plasmid (CTGF-OE), negative control lentiviral plasmid (NC), CTGF-specific shRNAs (sh-CTGF), negative control shRNAs and the according lentivirus were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Co. (Shanghai, China). Viral titres of approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 infectious units/ml were obtained. Lentivirus infection was performed with polybrene according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs.

Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates CTGF Expression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells and Inhibits Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFTo reveal the potential mechanism by which ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h. Pink and blue colors represent gene expression levels above and below the mean, respectively. (B) qPCR illustrated the downregulation of CTGF mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (C) and ELISA (D) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates Fibroblast Expression of CTGF and Inhibits the Ability of Breast Cancer Cells to Transform Fibroblasts Into CAF-Like CellsBecause CTGF is associated with the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, we examined the effect of ATL-1 on CTGF expression in fibroblasts. We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation. (-) in (E) represent without ATL-1 and rCTGF treatment. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Increased the Sensitivity of TNBC Cells to Paclitaxel by Downregulating the Expression of CTGF in FibroblastsTo study the role of CTGF in the sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts and then examined the effects of ATL-1 and rCTGF on the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.Atractylenolide-I Sensitizes Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Paclitaxel in a Mouse ModelFinally, we analyzed the effect of ATL-1 on chemosensitivity in vivo. We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6). When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment and ATL-1 treatment were started. Primary tumor size was measured and quantified every three days for 6 weeks. The abscissa represents the time after the start of treatment. (B) Representative images of metastatic tumors in lungs and liver, which were stained with HE.

Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

        "content": "Fibulin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein often associated with fibronectin (FN) in vivo. In this study, the ability of fibulin-1 to modulate adhesion, spreading and motility-promoting activities of FN was investigated. Fibulin-1 was found to have pronounced inhibitory effects on the cell attachment and spreading promoted by FN. Fibulin-1 was also found to inhibit the motility of a variety of cell types on FN substrata. For example, the FN-dependent haptotactic motility of breast carcinoma (MDA MB231) cells, epidermal carcinoma (A431), melanoma (A375 SM), rat pulmonary aortic smooth muscle cells (PAC1) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was inhibited by the presence of fibulin-1 bound to FN-coated Boyden chamber membranes. Cells transfected to overproduce fibulin-1 displayed reduced velocity, distance of movement and persistence time on FN substrata. Similarly, the incorporation of fibulin-1 into FN-containing type I collagen gels inhibited the invasion of endocardial cushion mesenchymal cells migrating from cultured embryonic heart explants. By contrast, incorporation of fibulin-1 into collagen gels lacking FN had no effect on the migration of endocardial cushion cells. These results suggest that the motility-suppressive effects of fibulin-1 might be FN specific. Furthermore, such effects are cell-type specific, in that the migration of gingival fibroblasts and endothelial cells on FN substrata is not responsive to fibulin-1. Additional studies found that the mechanism for the motility-suppressive effects of fibulin-1 does not involve perturbations of interactions between alpha5beta1 or alpha4 integrins, or heparan sulfate proteoglycans with FN. However, fibulin-1 was found to inhibit extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation and to suppress phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain. This ability to influence signal transduction cascades that modulate the actin-myosin motor complex might be the basis for the effects of fibulin-1 on adhesion and motility.",

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox hazard regression analysis.ResultsAssociations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological characteristics of early breast cancerTMAs from tumours of two different randomised studies on tamoxifen benefit in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal women 18, 19, was subjected to PDGFR\u03b2 IHC analyses and scored as previously described (Figure 1) 10, 11.Tumour stromal PDGFR\u03b2 immunohistochemical staining in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.

No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

IntroductionTumors are pathological complexes composed of tumor cells and the tumor stroma or tumor microenvironment (TME), which consists of cellular and acellular components, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), macrophages, blood vessels, pericytes, and extracellular matrices (ECM). In fact, CAFs induce a cancer phenotype and are responsible for the production of proteolytic enzymes, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. CAFs contribute up to 90% of the macroscopic tumor mass, provide mechanical support to tumor cells and control their survival, metastasis, proliferation, and resistance to therapies. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts and epithelial/endothelial cells, and adipocytes and pericytes that transdifferentiate to mesenchymal cells; therefore, they represent a heterogeneous cell population within the TME.Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a membrane-anchored peptidase expressed by CAFs at the stromal level of various tumor entities and contributes to progression and a worse prognosis. FAP degrades denatured collagens and participates in tumor growth via a non-enzymatic mechanism.Diagnostic FAP inhibitor radiotracers under clinical evaluation use 18F and 68Ga linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine and cyclo-[benzene(trimethanethiol-DOTA)-Met-Pro-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Met] (FAPI-2286) structures, which are radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography), and only one work has reported 99mTc, also linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine for SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging. Internationally, the amount of equipment available for molecular imaging studies is predominantly higher for gamma cameras (SPECT modality), and they represent more than 70% of the total. For SPECT images, the most-employed radionuclide is 99mTc. Therefore, the need for target-specific radiopharmaceuticals labeled with 99mTc is increasing within the field of oncology. Our group previously reported [99mTc]Tc-((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl) boronic acid ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP) as a new SPECT radioligand capable of specifically detecting FAP expressed by CAFs located in the cancer stroma and, to our knowledge, the first ligand based on 99mTc-labeled boron-Pro derivatives. Furthermore, the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP biokinetic\u2013dosimetric evaluation in healthy volunteers and three cancer patients diagnosed with breast, lung, and cervical cancer showed favorable biokinetics and uptake in primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases, achieving high-quality and high-contrast molecular images.This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity.2. ResultsNo adverse events related to the diagnostic use of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP were observed. Table 1 shows the general characteristics of patients included in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging evaluation. A detailed cancer staging of patients is shown in Table A1 (Appendix A). Patient imaging results were categorized into two groups. Patients with gliomas (n = 5), with which SPECT and SPECT/MR images were acquired, were identified as the first group. The second group involves all cases (n = 27) of breast, lung, colon, NET, renal cortex, and cervical cancer, in which SPECT/CT and PET/CT images were obtained.[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas (T/Bc range 6.3\u201313.9) (Table 2) and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma (Figure 1). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging resolution and contrast were good enough for the high-grade glioma, which could allow the performing of non-invasive diagnoses to differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas based on their distinct FAP expression. For all cancer cases, a total of 111 lesions were evaluated, which were classified as primary tumors (PT)(n = 26), lymph node metastases (LNm) (n = 61), and distant metastases (Dm) (n = 24) (Table 3). All primary tumors were detected with both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and [18F]FDG PET/CT (Figure 2 and Figure 3), which did not occur with LNm and Dm lesions (Figure 4 and Figure 5). That is, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT detected PT (100%), LNm (51%), and Dm (17%) in contrast to [18F]FDG PET/CT, which detected PT (100%), LNm (100%), and Dm (88%) (Table 3). The non-detection of LNm and Dm with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP could be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), including those not detected in NT and lung cancer, but not in 39% of the lesions with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Additionally, none of the Dm lesions detected by [18F]FDG in patients with triple negative and luminal B HER2+ molecular subtypes at the bone, liver, and lung exhibited [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake.These results are expected since FAP expression decreases once the cells succeed to invade. FAP is a protein that promotes metastasis; therefore, once the micrometastasis is established in a distant site from the PT, it loses its FAP expression. The signaling mediated by FAP/integrins/PI3K has a negative effect on IGF2 expression (associated with increased glucose uptake). This fact probably explains why as FAP uptake in Dm decreases, FDG uptake increases. As a unique feature of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP images, a very low background was achieved as previously reported (Figure 3). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake was considerably lower regarding [18F]FDG in patients with cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the adrenal cortex, which agrees with their relatively low FAP expression in comparison to lung and breast cancer (Figure 2). In general, the Dm lesions detected with [18F]FDG did not show [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, except for peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in recurrent colorectal cancer, which only showed [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, but not [18F]FDG uptake (Figure 5). CAFs are abundant in mesothelial metastases, and, through the mesothelial-mesenchymal transformation mechanism, it is likely that in carcinomatosis there is a greater transdifferentiation of mesenchymal cells towards CAFs FAP+.When comparing the values obtained from the average tumor-to-background ratios of the different background sites [T/Bm (tumor/mediastinum), T/Bl (tumor/liver) and T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle)] for all lesions, the highest values were T/Bp for both imaging methods (Figure 6). Although no statistically significant difference was found, the values of the T/Bp ratios were higher with [18F]FDG than with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (Figure 6). In the T/B data, the same trend is observed in terms of a higher uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the primary tumors compared to that obtained in the lymph node and distant metastases (Figure 6).In the case of breast cancer, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP showed a significant positive correlation between the T/Bp value of the primary tumors and the molecular subtype (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8085), where HER2+ and Luminal B HER2+ enriched subtypes showed the highest T/Bp ratios (Figure 7). The [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in HER2+ could be associated to the Erb2-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr654 of \u03b2-catenin, which promotes the activation of Wnt signaling pathways and the consequent promotion of the tumor invasive capacity (FAP expression) through a very common mechanism in breast cancer, the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, induced by the microenvironment, which infers the gain of invasive capacity and the arrest of the cell cycle, while, at the signaling level, it implies the repression of E-cadherin expression through snail/slug. In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp ratio was observed and there was no significant correlation among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027) (Figure 7). 3. DiscussionThe expression of FAP is an indication that the cell is expressing an invasive phenotype associated with an intense process of differentiation, typical of the first stages of carcinogenesis. During this phase, there is an intense activation of signaling pathways aimed at promoting the differentiation of cell precursors towards the activated fibroblast phenotype. As the tumor evolves, the stroma changes genetically and epigenetically to generate the appropriate niche for its stage. Cellular plasticity allows cells to adapt to their microenvironment through reprogramming processes (phenotypic and genotypic modifications) for tumor progression. RNAs produce epigenetic modifications that alter transcription, activating stem cell transformation and EMT processes (including FAP expression), which are essential for invasion to occur. FAP is overexpressed by CAFs from various tumor entities, making it a promising biomarker and target for many medical interventions. CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4) are classified depending on the expression of six markers: integrin b1/CD29, \u03b1-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+).In their study, Kratochwil et al. demonstrated the elevated and selective uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-04 in the stroma of multiple tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and NET cancer. However, this research demonstrated the tumor stroma imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP as the first SPECT radioligand based on a boron-Pro derivative.The results showed that the detection of primary tumor lesions with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is consistent when compared with [18F]FDG. However, when detecting LNm and Dm, the superiority of [18F]FDG is clear. This fact can be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), but not in 39% of the tumors with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Thus, our findings are discussed from the perspective of tumor stroma heterogeneity in lesions with enough size to be detected by SPECT. As mentioned, the dynamics of differentiation in the tumor microenvironment are attributed to genetic and non-genetic changes in tumor cells, the composition of the extracellular matrix, cell\u2013cell interactions, and cell heterogeneity. Based on this, it is likely that the increased uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP by primary tumors due to the presence of increased amounts of CAF-S1 FAP+ indicates an active EMT process, which is known to happen in the early phases of carcinogenesis, through which the dissemination of cells from the primary mass to distant sites is promoted. EMT involves the regulation of both intercellular adhesions by decreasing E-cadherin and increasing N-cadherin, as well as substrate adhesions through integrin mediated primarily by TGF-B, \u03b2-catenin, and the Wnt signaling pathway.On the other hand, hypoxic and hypoglycemic tumor stroma synergistically promotes the EMT phenotype in carcinomas. Thus, tumors where GLUT1 expression is commonly increased will also have an inability to express an (invasive) EMT phenotype. Accordingly, it is likely that the lack of uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in LNm and Dm is related to the fact that in this type of lesion there is an increase in the expression of GLUT1 receptors that leads to an increase in glucose metabolism, which produces a rise in the uptake of [18F]FDG and, at the same time, inhibits EMT (including FAP expression). The neoplasm with the largest number of patients in this study was breast cancer, which showed a significant positive correlation in PT between the T/Bp value and the molecular subtypes, with the highest T/Bp ratios for the HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes HER2+. The T/Bp values in HER2+ breast cancer showed a significant decrease in the LN metastases regarding PT (Figure 7), which may be due to crosstalking (cross-regulation), which occurs between integrins and EGFR receptors, such as HER2. Additionally, it is known that the Wnt signaling pathway promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in a HER2-dependent manner. It was recently confirmed that the expression of HER2 in the cell membrane is heterogeneous and that the accumulation of HER2 occurs in regions where adhesion to the extracellular matrix is dynamic. Therefore, HER2 expression decreases in regions where focal adhesions are concentrated, and the relative local decrease in HER2 expression in LNm, compared to PT, is probably related to the metastatic process. As a relevant point, it is noted that the presence of CAFs in the tumor stroma of breast cancer is associated with resistance to immunotherapy, since the elements secreted by CAFs derived from HER2+ tumors regulate resistance to treatment in a paracrine way. Thus, the decrease in [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake by LNm could indicate greater sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment.Highly-relevant data have been reported on axillary LNm in breast cancer: (1) the stroma represents around 25\u201330% of the invaded areas (regardless of subtype); (2) the predominant CAF subpopulations are CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (the latter being the most abundant); (3) CAFs enrichments are different in LNm compared to PT; (4) the secretion of CXCL12\u03b2 by CAF-S1 and the expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells is involved in the initiation of EMT and in the distant metastatic process, particularly in lung and bone; and (5) the global stromal content in LNm provides a prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients and, therefore, the CAF-S1/CAF-S4 abundance status exhibits a prognostic value, since both present pro-invasive properties with different modes of action; however, CAF-S4 is known to have a greater impact on distant metastatic spread (Dm), particularly on the liver.CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12\u03b2, promoting the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the cell differentiation into CD25+FOXP3+ cells. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells is also enhanced by CAF-S1. CAF-S4 is highly contractile and induces cancer cell invasion in three dimensions through Notch signaling. CAF-S1 FAP+ is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2+ and triple negative), confirming that FAP+ is a poor prognostic marker.Summarizing, the relatively low performance of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in detecting LNm and Dm may be related to the molecular biology of cancer and the proportion of the enrichment of CAF-S1 FAP+, which is not the most abundant in metastatic lesions (LN or distant) (Figure 8). Even when the FAP expression is associated with a phenotype that tends to transmigration and proliferation, attention must be placed on the fact that its expression is temporary and that it depends largely on the tumor microenvironment dynamics; thus, when the characteristics of the tumor stroma are modified, FAP expression and cancer prognosis can change.Our results differ from the work of K\u00f6mek et al., where they showed that PET/CT [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 is superior to [18F]FDG in the detection of primary mammary lesions and metastases (ganglionic and visceral) in twenty patients with breast cancer, both in primary and recurrent lesions, although the average size of the evaluated LNm was 10 mm. On the other hand, Backhaus et al. evaluated the use of PET/MRI with the ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT in 19 women with breast cancer with evidence of high uptake in the primary lesions (mean diameter of 26 mm) and LNm (average diameter of 21 mm). Our results probably vary from the previous research carried out due to the heterogeneity of the sample with respect to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, the image acquisition time, and the different image acquisition method (SPECT/CT vs. PET/CT vs. PET/MRI). The dynamic behavior of FAP is firmly associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution (tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, the promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation), which deserves to be used as a tool for the detection of the heterogeneity of the tumor stroma in the different stages of cancer through molecular imaging with specific radiotracers, such as [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. Therefore, additional clinical studies must be performed, including the results of the ex vivo FAP expression in tumors (immunohistochemical evaluation) to be correlated with the uptake of FAP inhibitory radiotracers. Today, CAFs is receiving considerable attention in the field of cancer biology. Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic targeting of FAP has been described in different modalities, such as vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles. In preclinical studies, CAF-S1 FAP+ has shown to cause resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduce antitumor immunity. CAFs from breast, ovarian, lung, pancreas, and colon cancer have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2; particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset. Additionally, the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.Taking into account the deleterious effect of metastases on the survival of breast cancer patients, our data could heighten the interest in evaluating the abundance of the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation, in vivo, in a non-invasive manner, by means of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT in axillary LNm during the initial clinical approach (staging) to determine the prognosis and the benefit of therapies, such as anti-FAP, anti-TGF\u03b2, anti-CXCR4, and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, in combination with standard therapies (Figure 8). More prospective research is needed to enrich the information obtained so far and we believe that future research can be focused on the function of FAP ligands in different molecular and histological subtypes of breast cancer, as well as their potential in detecting relapse of the disease, in the evaluation of the response to therapy and the prognosis of the patient.Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a complication of various malignant tumors and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. The superiority of uptake by [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in peritoneal carcinomatosis, due to recurrent colon cancer observed in the patient included in this study, agrees with the findings previously described, demonstrating a greater sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 for the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with various types of cancer.The findings observed in patients with glioma coincide with the data previously reported by R\u00f6hrich et al., where they showed little or no uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 in low-grade WHO II gliomas and high uptake in gliomas of high WHO III-IV grade, regardless of HDI status; therefore, its usefulness could lie mainly in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus post-treatment changes and in surgical and/or radiotherapy planning, for which more prospective studies are needed in this regard.4. Materials and Methods4.1. ReagentsAn iFAP (boron-Pro ligand) lyophilized kit for 99mTc labeling was obtained from the National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico) with GMP certification. [99mTc]TcO4Na was eluted from a generator (99Mo/99mTc GETEC, ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico). Other reagents were received from Millipore Co. (Burlington, MA, USA). 4.2. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP PreparationAfter the reconstitution of the iFAP lyophilized kit with a [99mTc]TcO4Na/0.2 M phosphate buffer (1:1 v/v, 2 mL, 740 MBq) solution and incubation in a block heater (92 \u00b0C, 15 min), the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP radioligand was obtained with a radiochemical purity (R.P.) greater than 98% (HPLC, Discovery C18 column, 5 \u00b5m particle size, I.D. of 0.46 cm, length of 25 cm; Supelco, Millipore, Burling-ton, MA, USA; coupled to a UV\u2013Vis detector and a radiometric detector), applying the following linear gradient: a flow rate of 1 mL/min, 0.1% TFA/water (A) (from 100 to 50%, over 10 min, maintained for 10 min, 30% over 5 min, and returned to 100% over 5 min) and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile (B). As previously reported, the lyophilized formulation contains the HYNIC-iFAP (((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)boronic) ligand with a specific alignment to the corresponding regions of the FAP binding site, stannous chloride as a reducing agent, as well as ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) to complete the coordination sphere of the [Tc(V)]HYNIC core (Figure 9).The chemical characterization of the iFAP ligand included analysis by mass spectrometry (UPLC-mass), 1H\u2013NMR, UV\u2013Vis and FT-IR. Radiochemical characterization included reversed-phase radio-HPLC and ITLC-SG (instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel) with the following mobile phases: 2-butanone, 0.1 M sodium citrate, and ammonium acetate-methanol (1:1 v/v), as reported in detail previously.4.3. PatientsThirty-two patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 50.8 \u00b1 16.7 years; 28 women and 4 men) with different types of cancer (breast cancer (n = 21), lung cancer (n = 2), adrenal cortex NETs (n = 1), colorectal cancer (n = 1), cervical cancer (n = 3) and gliomas (n = 5)) were included.The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n = 5 gliomas) and Group 2 (n = 27 breast, lung, colon, renal cortex NET, and cervical cancer). The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and with a detailed clinical description in Appendix A (Table A1). All oncological diagnoses were determined histopathologically (Table 2).The patients underwent SPECT/CT 1\u20133 h (with an average of 2 h) after the intravenous application of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5MBq). In Group 1, only of the brain region, and in Group 2, the thoracoabdominal region. The tumor/background ratio is optimal for diagnostic images from 30 min post-injection. However, it was decided 2 h after radiotracer administration to improve the contrast of the images (lesions vs. background). The acquisition protocol and the post-injection waiting time were the same for all types of cancer evaluated. However, in patients with cervical cancer or pelvic etiology, immediate image acquisition was performed post-micturition to reduce the artifact of radiotracer accumulation in the urine.All patients in Group 1 had previous cranial MRI (6 \u00b1 1 days interval) and patients in Group 2 had previous [18F]FDG PET/CT studies carried out (11 \u00b1 12.6 days interval).This research was performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the National Cancer Institute (INCan), Mexico. The patients signed an informed consent declaration, and the protocol was approved by the institutional Nuclear Medicine Ethics Committee. 4.4. Image Acquisition[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT images were acquired with a dual-head gamma camera (SPECT/CT, Symbia TruePoint, Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA), with low-energy, high-resolution collimators; parameters: window at 140 keV, matrix size of 128 \u00d7 128, with dispersion correction, 90 images of 8 s, rotation of 360 degrees. For the attenuation correction map, the low-dose CT parameters were obtained. A Butterworth filter (cutoff: 0.5, 5th order) and an iterative method (8 iterations /4 subsets) were used for the reconstruction of the raw data.SPECT/CT images were acquired 2 h after the intravenous administration of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5 MBq). The anatomical region studied in Group 1 was only the brain and in Group 2 it was thoracoabdominal. Activity in regions of interest was quantified, via 3D imaging, as Bq/cm3.All patients in Group 2 had undergone a prior PET/CT (Excel 20) scan (Siemens Medical Solutions), performed at 1 h after [18F]FDG administration (CT: slice thickness of 5 mm, 180 mAs and 120 kVp). Whole-body scans were obtained in 3D mode from the vertex to mid-thighs (2\u20133 min per bed position). PET images were reconstructed using a two-dimensional expectation algorithm of ordered subsets.4.5. Image AnalysisImages obtained with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG were examined on a Siemens VG60 multimodal workstation. Visual and semi-quantitative analyses were performed by two physicians with more than 9 years of experience in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (workstation with processing software for volumetric analysis).Visual analysis was performed on both groups of patients. Uptake was compared with the morphology of the corresponding lesion using CT and/or MRI, depending on the patient group. The detected lesions were divided into three categories for study: primary tumor (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). The semiquantitative analysis of lesion uptake was obtained by calculating the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B) with spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) to homogenize the data obtained with both radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, in Group 2, the concordance of uptake between both radiotracers was compared by quantifying the number of lesions (PT, LNm, and Dm).4.6. Tumor Tissue SamplesAll patients underwent a biopsy of the primary tumor lesion. Histopathology was used to determine the existence of viable tumor tissue and to verify the diagnosis. The histopathological reports were interpreted by a certified and experienced pathologist.4.7. Statistical AnalysisThe Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the T/Bp [99mTc]Tc-iFAP values and the molecular subtypes of the patients with breast cancer; a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.5. ConclusionsThe results of this pilot study show that SPECT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is a promising and potentially useful tool in the evaluation of the tumor microenvironment of multiple solid neoplastic entities. Within the different types of cancer that we included, we observed a potential panorama in the prognostic evaluation of recently diagnosed breast cancer, as well as its probable diagnostic superiority in peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent colon cancer. [18F]FDG was superior to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the detection of LNm and Dm. However, with the analyses carried out, we can establish that the role of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is not to displace metabolic molecular imaging, but rather that it serves as a complement for an adequate prognostic evaluation.Further prospective [99mTc]Tc-iFAP clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization, G.F.-F., P.V.-A., E.A.-V. and M.L.-G.; methodology, P.V.-A., M.L.-G., P.C.-T. and B.S.-B.; formal analysis, P.V.-A., C.S.-C., G.F.-F., F.O.G.-P., B.O.-G. and E.A.-V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.V.-A. and G.F.-F.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.F.-F.; funding acquisition, M.L.-G. and C.S.-C.

Four CAF subpopulations have been reported in the lymph node metastases of breast cancer (CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The most relevant and predominant are CAF-S1 FAP+ and CAF-S4 FAP-. Pelon et al. established a model of clinical application to the knowledge generated from the different subpopulations, in such a way that a prognostic impact is proposed according to the predominance of CAFs as follows: if at the time of diagnosis the patient exhibits low content of CAF-S1 FAP+ in LNm, they present a low risk of late Dm ((a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-), no uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal A breast cancer); on the other hand, if high levels of CAF-S1 FAP+ are demonstrated in LNm, the risk of distant metastasis increases ((b) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(+), uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal B HER2+ breast cancer). Finally, in distant metastatic lesions, only CAF-S4 FAP- is expressed [(c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-) in lung Dm and extremely low uptake in some right axillary lymph nodes that exhibit hypermetabolism with [18F]FDG; likewise, (d) multiple lung and liver metastases did not exhibit uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP].

        "title": "The tumor microenvironment modulates tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer: a role for soluble stromal factors and fibronectin through \u03b21 integrin.",
        "content": "Tamoxifen resistance has been largely attributed to genetic alterations in the epithelial tumor cells themselves, such as overexpression of HER-2/Neu. However, in the clinic, only about 15-20% of cases of HER-2/Neu amplification has actually been correlated to the acquisition of endocrine resistance, suggesting that other mechanisms must be involved as well. Using the epithelial LM05-E and the fibroblastic LM05-F cell lines, derived from the estrogen dependent spontaneous M05 mouse mammary tumor, as well as MCF-7 cells, we analyzed whether soluble stromal factors or extracellular matrix components protected against tamoxifen induced cell death. Involvement of signaling pathways was determined by using specific inhibitors and western blot, and phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor alpha by western blot and immunofluorescence. Soluble factors produced by the fibroblastic cells protect the epithelial tumor cells from tamoxifen-induced cell death through a mechanism that involves EGFR and matrix metalloproteinases upstream of PI3K/AKT.

        "full_text": "The tumor microenvironment modulates tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer: a role for soluble stromal factors and fibronectin through \u03b21 integrinTamoxifen resistance has been largely attributed to genetic alterations in the epithelial tumor cells themselves, such as overexpression of HER-2/Neu. However, in the clinic, only about 15\u201320% of cases of HER-2/ Neu amplification has actually been correlated to the acquisition of endocrine resistance, suggesting that other mechanisms must be involved as well. Using the epithelial LM05-E and the fibroblastic LM05-F cell lines, derived from the estrogen dependent spontaneous M05 mouse mammary tumor, as well as MCF-7 cells, we analyzed whether soluble stromal factors or extracellular matrix components protected against tamoxifen induced cell death. Involvement of signaling pathways was determined by using specific inhibitors and western blot, and phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor alpha by western blot and immunofluorescence. Soluble factors produced by the fibroblastic cells protect the epithelial tumor cells from tamoxifen-induced cell death through a mechanism that involves EGFR and matrix metalloproteinases upstream of PI3K/AKT. Exogenous fibronectin by itself confers endocrine resistance through interaction with \u03b21 integrin and activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK 1/2 pathways. The conferred resistance is reversed by blocking \u03b21 integrin. We show also that treatment with both conditioned medium and fibronectin leads to the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor at serine-118, suggesting stromal factors as modulators of ER activity. Our results show that the tumor microenvironment can modulate tamoxifen resistance, providing an alternative explanation for why patients become refractory to hormone-therapy.IntroductionTamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been the main adjuvant treatment for estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients for approximately 30 years. However, the development of both de novo and acquired resistance are still important clinical problems that need to be fully understood. Research focused on understanding the mechanisms of acquired tamoxifen resistance has been mostly carried out using the human MCF-7 cell line and as such current hypothesis are based on autocrine, or paracrine mechanisms between epithelial cells. Deregulation of the HER-2/Neu pathway has been shown to contribute to tumor progression and tamoxifen resistance, leading to the development of drugs such as Trastuzamab. However, clinical data show that only a relatively small group (15\u201320%) of ER positive patients who acquire tamoxifen resistance actually show changes in HER-2 status, implicating the involvement of other mechanisms.Tumors are complex organs composed not only of neoplastic cells, but also contain fibroblasts, blood vessels, immune cells, and extracellular matrix. Evidence suggests that both tumor progression and response to therapy are modulated by the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, several papers have implicated stromal signatures as predictors of response to therapy in breast cancer. Moreover, response to tamoxifen is associated with the overexpression of an extracellular matrix gene cluster. However, probably due to the lack of adequate experimental models, the molecular link between stromal factors and tamoxifen resistance remains to be explored. We recently characterized the spontaneous M05 mouse mammary tumor that arose in a BALB/c mouse in our animal facility and showed that it is estrogen dependent and tamoxifen sensitive in early passages and progresses to endocrine resistance. From it, we generated a bicellular cell line, LM05-Mix, composed of both epithelial and fibroblastic cells that were subsequently separated to generate the epithelial LM05-E and fibroblastic LM05-F cell lines, respectively. Our previous work showed that the fibroblastic LM05-F cells conferred tamoxifen resistance to the otherwise tamoxifen-sensitive LM05-E cells. In this paper, we unravel the mediators involved in this protective effect and show that fibroblast-derived soluble factors, and fibronectin through its interaction with \u03b21 integrin, modulate resistance to tamoxifen in epithelial cells. Our results support the above-mentioned clinical data and sustain the notion that changes in the stroma may play a key role in the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.Materials and methodsCell cultureThe MCF-7 and LM05-Mix, -E, -F cell lines were routinely maintained in growth medium, consisting of DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, GenSA, Buenos Aires, Argentina) and gentamicin, in a humidified 5% CO2/air atmosphere. Serial passages were carried out by treatment of 80% confluent monolayers with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 0.02% EDTA in Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free PBS.Cell treatmentsFor cell death experiments, 35,000 cells were plated in eight well LabTek chamber slides (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) in growth medium. The next day, they were washed twice with phenol red free DMEM/F12, and treatments were carried out in this culture medium supplemented with 1% charcoal stripped FCS. 17-\u03b2-estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a final concentration of 10 nM, and 4-OH-tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 \u00b5M, as previously described. Both were prepared as 1000\u00d7 stock solutions in absolute ethanol, and the corresponding dilutions of ethanol were used for the control cells. To test the role of fibronectin (Millipore, Billerica, MA), chamber slides were previously coated using 200 \u00b5l per well of a solution of fibronectin (2 \u00b5g/100 \u00b5l in water) or the equivalent amount of fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) as a control. When used in a soluble fashion, fibronectin was added to the media at a concentration of 30 \u00b5g/ml. For treatments with LM05-F-conditioned media (FCM), the day after seeding, cells were washed and treated with a mixture of 70% FCM + 30% fresh medium, plus the corresponding treatments. To prepare FCM, 1 \u00d7 106 LM05-F cells were plated in growth medium in 100-mm dishes. The next day, they were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 18 h in 5 ml of serum free, phenol red free DMEM/F12. This medium was collected, centrifuged to remove any floating cells and cell debris, and finally aliquoted and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used. Regarding specific inhibitors, the following were used: MAPK pathway inhibitor PD98059 (10 \u00b5M; Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 (10 \u00b5M; Calbiochem), the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 (10 \u00b5M; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (6.4 \u00b5M; Calbiochem). We did not detect estrogenic activity on MCF-7 cells by ERE-Luc reporter assays or proliferation assays in the PD98059 (10 \u00b5M) we used (our unpublished observations). At least 10009 stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared in DMSO, and the equivalent dilutions of DMSO were used as controls. To block \u03b21 integrin, cells were incubated for 15 min with the AIIB2 monoclonal antibody (0.15 \u00b5g/ml; Aragen Bioscience, Morgan Hill, CA) or with control pre-immune IgG before being plated in the chamber slides, as previously described by others.Cell death assaysWe previously showed that treatment of LM05-E cells with 4-OH-tamoxifen leads to cell death as measured by the TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Flourescein, Roche Applied Science, Bromma, Sweden) or propidium iodide (PI) exclusion. Thus, for these experiments, cells were seeded in LabTek chamber slides as described above and after the 48 h of treatment concluded, slides were washed with PBS, and cells were incubated for 1 min in a PI solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 50 \u00b5g/ml in PBS), washed in PBS, and fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 10 min. Nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Research Organics Inc., Cleveland, OH), and slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Experiments were carried out in triplicates, and 10 random fields with an average of 200 cells/field were counted per well. The percentage of PI-positive cells relative to the total number of cells (stained with DAPI) was calculated as a measure of cell death and is expressed as % dead cells in the graphs. Images were taken using a Nikon TE2000S inverted fluorescent microscope and counted using the Image Pro Plus software.Western blotTo evaluate the activation of the different signaling pathways by fibronectin and FCM, 600.000 LM05-E cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes in growth medium. The next day, cells were washed twice, and media was replaced by phenol red free medium. Cells were starved for 48 h and were then subjected to treatments with FCM or fibronectin (30 \u00b5g/ml) for the indicated periods of time. Protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing cells on ice in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate and 1% NP40) containing protease inhibitors (40 \u00b5m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin, 50 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 200 \u00b5M orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method. Samples were mixed with 4\u00d7 sample buffer containing \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 2 min. Fifty micrograms of each sample was then separated in SDS-PAGE mini gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The membranes were blocked overnight in 5% fat free milk, 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS at 4\u00b0C. Primary antibodies were used at a 1/500\u20131/2000 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and 2.5% fat free milk and were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. After washing with PBST, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at a 1/1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-phospho ERK1/2, mouse anti-ERK 1/2, rabbit anti-phospho AKT, rabbit anti-AKT, rabbit anti-\u03b21 integrin, rabbit anti-E-cadherin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-phospho-serine 188 ER (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), mouse anti-phosphor-EGFR (Tyr1 173) and rabbit anti-EGFR (Millipore). The following secondary antibodies were used: donkey anti-rabbit HRP and goat anti-mouse HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). E-cad-herin was used as loading control.ZymographyConditioned media prepared from LM05-F and LM05-E cells as indicated above was analyzed by gelatin substrate gels as described previously. In brief, 10 \u00b5l of conditioned medium was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agents, incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, and separated on 8.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-poly-acrylamide slab gels containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich). After electrophoresis, gels were incubated for 30 min with 2.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently overnight at 37\u00b0C in 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.4, containing 15 mM CaCl2. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma-Aldrich) and destained with water. Clear zones emerged against a blue background, indicating proteolytic activity. The same procedure was used to analyze proteolytic activity in LM05-E-conditioned media.ImmunofluorescenceCells grown on LabTek assemblies were fixed in 4% formalin in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 20 additional minutes. Non-specific sites were blocked with 2% FCS in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody against phosphor-serine 118 ER (Cell Signaling) and the primary antibody against fibronectin (a kind gift from Dr. Alberto Kornblihtt) were prepared in blocking buffer at a 1/100 dilution and applied overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber. Samples were washed in PBS and incubated with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (FITC, Invitrogen) or the rabbit anti-mouse (FITC, Invitrogen) prepared in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed and counterstained with DAPI or PI and mounted with Vectashield. Samples were analyzed under a Nikon Laser Confocal Microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) or a Nikon TE2000S inverted fluorescent microscope. For each experiment, the same gain was used to acquire all images by confocal microscopy. Staining intensity was calculated using Image Pro Plus software. For each time point, the staining value was normalized to propidium iodide.Statistical analysisThe statistical significance of differences between groups was calculated by applying one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.ResultsFibroblast-derived soluble factors confer tamoxifen resistance to otherwise tamoxifen-sensitive epithelial cells: involvement of EGFR, MMPs and PI3K/AKTFrom the estrogen-dependent M05 mouse mammary tumor, we established a continuous cell line referred to as LM05-Mix. Two distinct cell populations were identified in the LM05-Mix cell line that were subsequently cloned to generate the epithelial LM05-E and the fibroblastic LM05-F cell lines, respectively. We previously showed that the proliferation of the LM05-E cells was stimulated by 10 nM estradiol and inhibited by 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen. On the other hand, the LM05-F cells did not respond to either estradiol or 4-OH-tamoxifen. Moreover, we demonstrated that 4-OH-tamoxifen-induced LM05-E inhibition of proliferation involved cell death as determined by the TUNEL assay and propidium iodide exclusion. However, when both cell types were cultivated together, the induction of 4-OH-tamoxifen cell death was inhibited. Thus, our results suggested that the presence of fibroblastic cells was allowing the epithelial cells to escape from 4-OH-tamoxifen-induced cell death.To understand the molecular mechanisms by which stromal\u2013epithelial interactions conferred tamoxifen resistance and determine whether physical interaction between the fibroblasts and epithelial cells was necessary for the protective effect, LM05-E cells were treated with 4-OH-tamoxifen for 48 h in the presence of LM05-F-conditioned media (FCM). FCM was sufficient to protect the epithelial cells from the tamoxifen-induced cell death, compared to non-conditioned media (NCM) (Fig. 1a). These results indicate that stromal-derived soluble factors, but not the physical interaction between the two cell types, are required for the protective effect. Aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways has been associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. Western blot analysis showed that FCM strongly activated the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, and to a lesser degree the PI3K/AKT pathway (Fig. 1b). To determine whether both pathways are implicated in mediating the protective effect, LM05-E cells were treated with tamoxifen in the presence of FCM with the addition of the signaling inhibitors PD98059 or LY294002. Only the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 reversed the protective effect of FCM (Fig. 2c). The effectiveness of the inhibitory effects of PD98059 and LY294002 can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 1a and b.The EGFR receptor family has been implicated in the induction of tamoxifen resistance and is known to activate the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in breast cancer cells. Most previous studies used MCF-7 cells that were modified to over express EGFR or Her-2 to show the involvement of this receptor family in the induction of tamoxifen resistance. LM05-E cells are EGFR positive, and we have not modified them to over express or over-activate this receptor. Treatment with FCM led to modest phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 1b). To investigate whether the paracrine activation of the EGFR pathway was involved in the protective effect conferred by FCM, LM05-E cells were treated with tamoxifen in the presence of FCM and the specific EGFR inhibitor, AG1478. The protective effect of the conditioned media was reversed by AG1478 treatment (Fig. 1d), implying that the paracrine activation of EGFR is necessary for the induction of tamoxifen resistance in LM05-E cells. As an indicator of the effectiveness of AG1478, we measured MAPK/ERK1/2 activation, which is downstream of EGFR, in the presence of the inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. 1c)Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) not only play a role in breaking down the extracellular matrix (ECM), but are involved also in the regulation of cell behavior by affecting, for example, the release of growth factors such as heparin-bound EGF. We wondered whether proteases could be involved in the FCM protective effect. Analysis of MMP activity in conditioned media of LM05-F cells revealed the presence of both MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, MMP activity was not detected by zymography in the conditioned media of LM05-E cells under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2a). To test whether stromal-derived MMPs were involved in the FCM protective effect, LM05-E cells were treated with 4-OH-tamoxifen in the presence of FCM and GM6001, a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor. In the presence of tamoxifen, GM6001 reversed the FCM protective effect but had no effect on cells that did not receive 4-OH-tamoxifen (Fig. 2b). Our results suggest that soluble factors produced by fibroblasts, including growth factors and MMPs, are involved in the paracrine induction of tamoxifen resistance through EGFR and the PI3K/AKT pathway.Fibronectin induced tamoxifen resistance through ligation of \u03b21 integrinsThe interaction of tumor cells with the ECM has been shown to induce protection against cell death. Moreover, the overexpression of fibronectin correlates with tamoxifen resistance in human breast cancer samples. However, to our knowledge, this has not been experimentally tested at the bench. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that fibronectin expression was specifically associated with the fibroblastic compartment in the LM05-Mix cell cultures (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, levels of \u03b21 integrin, the main fibronectin receptor, were much higher in the epithelial LM05-E cells compared to the fibroblastic LM05-F cells (Fig. 3b). To test whether matrix components are involved in conferring tamoxifen resistance, LM05-E cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated plastic. We did not detect a significant increase in cell death when cells adhering to fibronectin were treated with tamoxifen (Fig. 3c). This same protective effect was observed when MCF-7 cells plated on fibronectin-coated plastic were treated with tamoxifen (Fig. 3d). To determine whether the protective effect of fibronectin was mediated by \u03b21 integrin, LM05-E cells were pre-incubated with the AIIB2 \u03b21 integrin blocking antibody and then seeded on fibronectin. Treatment with AIIB2 dramatically reduced the protective effect of fibronectin on tamoxifen-induced cell death (Fig. 4a). We were unsuccessful in carrying out these experiments with MCF-7 cells given that blocking \u03b21 integrin impeded cell adhesion to fibronectin and caused cell death (not shown), confirming previous data showing an increase in cell death by AIIB2 in this cell line. Analysis of signaling pathways downstream of \u03b21 integrin in LM05-E cells showed phosphorylation of FAK and activation of MAPK/ERK 1/2 and to a lower degree of PI3K/AKT (Fig. 4b). To test whether these pathways were directly involved in the protective effect, LM05-E cells seeded on fibronectin were treated with MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT inhibitors in the presence of 4-OH-tamoxifen. In both cases, the protective effect of fibronectin was reversed (Fig. 4c). None of the inhibitors affected cell viability in the absence of 4-OH-tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. 1d). These results indicate that both pathways were directly involved in fibronectin conferred tamoxifen resistance. Finally, we tested whether fibronectin could be involved in regulating MMP activity in LM05-E or -F cells. We found no association with MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity as determined by exposure to fibronectin followed by zymography of conditioned media (Fig. 4e).We initially showed that the treatment of LM05-E cells with conditioned media led to tamoxifen resistance through a mechanism involving EGFR. EGFR has been shown to cross talk with \u03b21 integrin in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, it was possible that soluble fibronectin fragments could be also involved in the FCM protective effect, inducing activation of EGFR. To determine whether \u03b21 integrin was involved in the conditioned media protective effect, cells were treated with tamoxifen and AIIB2 in the presence of FCM. As shown in Fig. 5a, AIIB2 blocked the conditioned media protective effect. However, when we treated LM05-E cells seeded on fibronectin with the EGFR inhibitor AG1478, we did not reverse the protective effect of fibronectin (Fig. 5b). Our results thus show that both soluble factors and ECM components such as fibronectin confer tamoxifen resistance, with \u03b21 integrin playing a key role in mediating the protective effect.Soluble factors and fibronectin induce the phosphorylation of the estrogen receptorPhosphorylation of specific serines on ER-\u03b1 is associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. To determine whether phosphorylation of serine-118 was regulated by stromal-derived factors, we preformed immunofluorescence staining to check the localization of phosphor-serine-118 ER (pSer-118 ER) in starved LM05-Mix cells. The staining revealed that pSer-118 ER was very strong in the epithelial islets (Fig. 6a). Next, to establish whether soluble factors within FCM and/or fibronectin were involved in the induction of ER phosphorylation, LM05-E cells were starved for 48 h and treated with conditioned media, or fibronectin, for different periods of time. Western blot analysis revealed that both treatments increased the levels of pSer-118 ER (Fig. 6b). To further confirm the effect of fibronectin, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were carried out on LM05-E cells treated with fibronectin for 15 min. As can be appreciated in Fig. 6c and d, staining for pSer-118 ER-\u03b1 increased in the fibronectin treated cells, as compared to the controls. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with FCM (not shown). Moreover, we did not observe high levels of pSer-118 ER in starved epithelial LM05-E cells as shown for the epithelial compartment of the LM05-Mix cells where stromal\u2013epithelial interactions are present (Fig. 6a), further supporting a role for stromal factors as modulators of ER-\u03b1 phosphorylation. Finally, we also found that fibronectin affected the phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 in MCF-7 cells as determined by immunofluorescence and western blot (Fig. 7a\u2013c). Moreover, phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 was inhibited by pre-treating the cells with PD98059 but not with LY294002, implying the involvement of MAPK/ERK1/2 in fibronectin induced ER-\u03b1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7c). Our results clearly show that stromal-derived soluble factors and fibronectin induce ER-\u03b1 phosphorylation in the epithelial cells and that this finding correlates with induction of tamoxifen resistance.DiscussionResistance to endocrine therapy is today a major clinical problem. Understanding the molecular events involved in resistance will most certainly contribute to the development of agents that may enhance clinical success. Although research carried out in the last decade has convincingly shown that the tumor stroma co-evolves with the neoplastic cells determining not only progression, but response to therapy, very few attempts have been carried out to investigate whether stromal\u2013epithelial interactions play a role in the development of endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show here that factors produced by fibroblasts derived from the M05 mouse mammary tumor confer tamoxifen resistance to otherwise sensitive epithelial cells. We demonstrate that unidentified soluble factors present in the conditioned media induce resistance through activation of EGFR and PI3K/AKT, with the involvement of \u03b21 integrin. Moreover, MMP activity is required to induce the protective effect. On the other hand, fibronectin makes the epithelial cells refractory to tamoxifen through binding to \u03b21 integrin and the activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. Both types of microenvironmental factors lead to the phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 at serine-118. Our results question the current experimental models that only consider autocrine or paracrine mechanisms between identical cells as responsible for endocrine resistance. The illustration shown in Fig. 8 portrays the model of tamoxifen resistance we are proposing in this paper.We showed previously that tumor-derived LM05-F fibroblasts protected epithelial LM05-E cells from tamoxifen-induced cell death. Here, we demonstrate that treatment with FCM induces tamoxifen resistance, suggesting that physical interaction of the fibroblasts and the epithelial cells is not necessary to convey the protective effect. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete a variety of growth factors that acting as paracrine factors induce the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways in cancer cells. Indeed, we find that the protective effect of FCM is blocked by PI3K/AKT inhibitors. However, inhibition of MAPK/ERK1/2 does not restore sensitivity to tamoxifen in FCM-treated epithelial cells, suggesting that this pathway does not play a key role in the protective effect induced by the stromal-derived soluble factors. In addition, cancer-associated fibroblasts produce large amounts of MMPs that remodel the tumor microenvironment. We show that inhibiting MMP activity abolished the protective effect of FCM. MMPs have been shown to play a role in growth factor release, such as heparin-bound EGF, production of bioactive ECM fragments, and shedding of growth factor receptors and surface molecules such as E-cadherin. It remains to be established which of these events may intervene in the induction of tamoxifen resistance.It has been well documented that the EGFR/HER-2 receptors are crucial for the development of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. However, the amplification of the genes that code for these receptors was detected in only 15\u201320% of patients who acquired tamoxifen resistance. We show that stromal-derived soluble factors activate EGFR and that blocking the activation prevents induction of tamoxifen resistance. Recently, Shekhar et al. showed that fibroblasts derived from ER\u2212/PR\u2212 human breast tumors conferred tamoxifen resistance to otherwise sensitive premalignant EIII8 and tumorigenic MCF-7 cells, when co-cultured. They suggest that EGFR is not involved in fibroblast-induced tamoxifen resistance because an association between tamoxifen resistance and levels of EGFR or phospho-EGFR and endocrine sensitivity was not found. However, it remains to be tested whether an EGFR inhibitor, such as AG1478, reverses the protective effect.Deposition of ECM components such as fibronectin is associated with the breast tumor stroma. Previously, an extracellular matrix gene cluster, which includes fibronectin, was associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast tumor samples. However, the precise function of fibronectin in the acquisition of tamoxifen resistance has not been addressed before. We show that fibronectin is exclusively associated with the stromal compartment in the LM05-Mix cultures. Importantly, breast cancer cells cultured on fibronectin are resistant to tamoxifen-induced cell death. The \u03b21 integrin antibody reversed the protective effect in LM05-E, indicating fibronectin\u2013integrin binding as necessary. We further show that the effect of fibronectin led to the activation of FAK and was mediated by the PI3K/AKT as well as the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. Others have previously shown that laminin inhibits estrogen action in MCF-7 and T47D cells. On the other hand, Hiscox et al. recently showed that in endocrine-resistant variants of MCF-7 cells, FAK activation is increased compared to the endocrine-sensitive parental cell line. We did not find an association between fibronectin\u2013integrin interaction and release of MMPs. Others have previously shown that \u03b15\u03b21-fibronectin binding leads to MMP-1-dependent invasion by breast cancer and mammary epithelial cells. However, we did not detect MMP-1 in our zymogram assays either in the presence of absence of fibronectin (data not shown). Deregulation of integrins has been previously associated with resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer, drug-induced apoptosis in myeloma, glioma and non-small lung cancer cells. A study carried out on 149 patients showed that high \u03b21 integrin expression was associated with decreased overall and disease-free survival among patients with invasive breast cancer. Furthermore, extracellular fibronectin expression was also associated with decreased overall and disease-free survival, and \u03b21 integrin expression was significantly correlated with fibronectin, implicating that integrin\u2013ligand interactions were correlated with a more aggressive disease.Although there is still controversy over this matter, tamoxifen resistance is mechanistically associated with the phosphorylation of the ER-\u03b1 at serines located in the AF-1 region of the receptor. We found that LM05-Mix cells cultured for 48 h in serum free media showed high levels of staining for pSer-118 ER-\u03b1 in the epithelial cell compartment, implicating stromal\u2013epithelial interactions in the modulation of ER-\u03b1 phosphorylation. Accordingly, we established that both FCM and fibronectin induced the phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 at this location. Interestingly, the effect of fibronectin was reproducible in MCF-7 cells. These results have important implications given the fact that as mentioned above, there is still controversy over the correlation between levels of phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 in the AF-1 region and tamoxifen resistance.In summary, our work shows that stromal-derived factors confer tamoxifen resistance to otherwise sensitive mammary epithelial tumor cells. The diversity of pathways involved suggests that the tumor microenvironment confers endocrine resistance through an array of overlapping mechanisms that are redundant. This implies that strategies that target only one signaling pathway may not re-sensitize endocrine-resistant tumors to tamoxifen and that the possibility of modulating the tumor microenvironment itself, or its interaction with the tumor cells, may be a more effective approach. Our results are the first, to our knowledge, to show an involvement of fibronectin in the induction of resistance to tamoxifen. Previous results from microarray analysis of human tumors had suggested a link between the stromal factors and tamoxifen resistance. Here, we confirm, in an experimental mouse setting, that the tumor stroma contributes to tamoxifen resistance and support the notion that endocrine therapy in combination with therapies that target the tumor microenvironment could be a future alternative to overcome endocrine resistance in breast cancer.Supplementary MaterialElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article

involves EGFR and PI3K/AKT. a LM05-E cells were cultured in non-conditioned media (NCM) or LM05-F-conditioned media (FCM) for 48 h in the presence of 10 nM estradiol (E2) or 10 nM estradiol plus 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E2 + T). Tamoxifen induced cell death in the presence of NCM; however, this effect was suppressed in the presence of FCM (*P<0.05). To establish the % of dead cells, once the treatments were over, cells were washed, incubated with PI, fixed, counterstained with DAPI, and mounted as explained in materials and methods. Cell death is expressed as the % of PI-positive cells/total number of cells. b Activation of signaling pathways by FCM in LM05-E cells. LM05-E cells starved for 48 h were treated for the indicated periods of time with FCM. Western blot analysis shows phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT and EGFR. E-cadherin was used as loading control. c LM05-E cells were treated as described in (a) with the addition of the MAPK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 (PD) or the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 (LY) (both at 10 \u00b5M) to the FCM-treated cells. Only LY294002 reversed the protective effect of FCM, (***P < 0.001). d LM05-E cells were treated as described in (a) with the addition of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (AG; 6.4 \u00b5M) to the FCM-treated cells. AG1478 reversed the FCM protective effect, but did not on its own affect the viability of the cells (***P<0.001). One of three experiments is shownMMP activity in FCM is required for paracrine-induced tamoxifen resistance. a LM05-E- and LM05-F-conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography; activities of MMP-9 and MMP-2 were only detected in conditioned media derived from LM05-F cells. b LM05-E cells were cultured in NCM or FCM and treated for 48 h with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or 10 nM E2 + 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E + T). Addition of the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (10 \u00b5M) reversed the FCM protective effect, but did not have any effects on its own (***P< 0.001). One of two experiments is shownFibronectin (FN) induces tamoxifen resistance in LM05-E and MCF-7 cells. a Immunofluorescence for FN (green, right panel) in LM05-Mix cell cultures (nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, left panel). FN was especially associated with the stromal compartment in the Mix cultures. b Western blot analyzing \u03b21 integrin expression in LM05-E and LM05-F cells plated on plastic. High levels of \u03b21 were especially detected for the epithelial LM05-E cells. c LM05-E cells were cultured on BSA (control) or FN and treated for 48 h with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or 10 nM E2 + 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E + T). The induction of cell death produced by tamoxifen was counteracted only in the group of cells cultured on FN (***P<0.001). d MCF-7 cells were treated as described for the LM05-E cells in (c) and FN, again, induced tamoxifen resistance confirming that the observed result is not specific to LM05-E cells (**P<0.01). One of three experiments is shownThe protective effect of FN is mediated by the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways and requires \u03b21 integrin. a LM05-E cells were plated on BSA or FN and treated with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or estradiol plus 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E2 + T) in the presence of the \u03b21 integrin blocking antibody AIIB2, or control IgG. AIIB2, but not the control IgG, reversed the protective effect (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). b LM05-E cells were treated with FN (30 \u00b5g/ml) for the indicated periods of time followed by western blots analyzing the phosphorylation of FAK, ERK1/2, and AKT. E-cadherin was used as loading control. c LM05-E cells were cultured on FN and treated with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or estradiol plus 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E2 + T) in the presence of the MAPK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 or the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 (both at 10 \u00b5M). Both inhibitors reversed the protective effect of FN (*P<0.05; ***P<0.001). d To determine whether FN was affecting the levels of secreted MMPs by LM05-E and LM05-F cells, conditioned media was prepared as explained in materials and methods from cells treated ON with vehicle or FN (30 \u00b5g/ml). The conditioned media was analyzed by zymography. No increase in MMP activity was detected in the conditioned media derived from FN treated wells as compared to controls. FCM was used as a positive control in the zymogram that analyzed the activity of the conditioned media prepared from LM05-E cells. Experiments were carried out in triplicates, each lane represents one well\u03b21 integrin mediates the protective effect of LM05-F-conditioned media, but EGFR is not involved in FN\u2019s protective effect. a To establish whether \u03b21 integrin played a role in LM05-F-conditioned media (FCM) induced tamoxifen resistance, LM05-E cells were plated in the presence of non-conditioned media (NCM) or FCM and treated with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or estradiol plus 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E2 + T). The addition of AIIB2 reversed the protective effect of FCM on E2 + T treated cells, but did not significantly affect the E2 treated cells; (**P<0.01; ***P<0.001). b To test the involvement of EGFR on FN\u2019s protective effect, LM05-E cells were cultured on BSA (control) or FN and treated for 48 h with 10 nM estradiol (E2) or 10 nM E2 + 1 \u00b5M 4-OH-tamoxifen (E2 + T) in the presence of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (AG; 6.4 \u00b5M). AG1478 did not reverse the protective effect of FN (***P<0.001). One of at least two experiments is shownFibronectin- and LM05-F-conditioned media induce phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 at serine-118 in LM05-E cells. a Immunofluorescence analyzing the levels of phospho-serine 118 ER (pSer-118). LM05-Mix cells were grown to 80% confluency in growth medium and were then starved for 48 h in phenol red free DMEM/F12. Staining to pSer-118 was carried out (green), and nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (red). Confocal images showed high levels of pSer-118 especially associated with the epithelial islets. b LM05-E cells were starved for 48 h and then treated for the indicated periods of time with FN or FCM. The levels of pSer-118 ER were analyzed by western blot. An increase in the levels of pSer-118 ER was detected in both the FN- and FCM-treated cells. E-cadherin was used as a loading control. c Immunofluorescence analyzing pSer-118 in control and FN treated LM05-E cells. LM05-E cells were seeded in chamber slides at 70% confluency and starved for 48 h. They were then treated with vehicle (water) or FN as indicated. Phospho-ser-118 staining was carried out using a FITC-labeled secondary antibody (green), and nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (red). FN induced an increase in the staining for pSer-118, in accordance with the results obtained from the western blots. d\nGraph showing the quantification of the pSer-118 staining corresponding to images shown in (c).

We found an increase in the levels of pSer-118 by treatment with FN. b Quantification of the staining intensity for pSer-118 corresponding to images shown in (a). Values for pSer-118 were normalized to propidium iodide for each treatment. c Western blot showing phosphorylation of ER at serine- 118 in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were grown to 80% confluency and then starved for 48 h. To determine the involvement of the MAPK/ ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways on the phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1, starved cells were pre-treated for 1 h with either vehicle (DMSO), PD98059 (10 \u00b5M), or LY294002 (10 \u00b5M). They were then subjected to a 15-min pulse of FN (30 \u00b5g/ml) or water as a control. Western blot analysis shows that FN leads to the phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1, and that it is inhibited by PD98059. No effect was detected with LY294002. One of at least two experiments is shownIllustration portraying the proposed mechanism of tamoxifen resistance. Soluble factors produced by carcinoma fibroblasts induce resistance through activation of EGFR and PI3K/AKT, with the involvement of \u03b21 integrin; MMP activity is required to induce the protective effect. On the other hand, stromal fibronectin makes the epithelial cells refractory to tamoxifen through binding to \u03b21 integrin and the activation of the MAPK/ ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways. Both types of microenvironmental factors lead to the phosphorylation of ER-\u03b1 at serine-118. Green arrows indicate signaling pathways that are activated and are involved in the protective effect; blue arrows indicate pathways that are activated but that do not play a key role downstream. Black arrows indicates cross talk between different types of receptors"

Expression of CAF-related proteins in the stroma differed depending on breast cancer molecular subtypes. All CAF-related protein expression was high (p &lt; 0.05) in HER-2 type, whereas in luminal A, the expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2 was low, and in TNBC, the expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and S100A4 was low. In the stromal component, CAF-related protein expression differed according to stromal phenotype (p &lt; 0.001). The desmoplastic type showed high expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, S100A4, PDGFR\u03b1, and PDGFR\u03b2, whereas the sclerotic type exhibited low expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2. The inflammatory type had high expression of FAP\u03b1 and NG2 with low podoplanin, while normal-like type showed low expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and S100A4. Our results suggested that differential CAF-related protein expression depended on the molecular subtypes and stromal histologic features of breast cancer, indicating that in the future, this system could potentially use these markers for prognosis prediction and targeted therapy of breast cancer.",

We conclude that the experimental studies on these formins have implications in the clinical behavior of basal-like breast cancer.IntroductionBreast cancer is currently regarded a group of diseases, with at least 5 molecular subtypes based on gene expression profiling. These include basal-like, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) enriched, luminal A and B, and normal-like. Basal-like cancers are particularly aggressive with a tendency for hematogenous spread and poor outcome. They express genes that are normally found in basal/myoepithelial cells of mammary glands.In clinical practice, all breast cancers are immunohistochemically screened for the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, as the presence of these offer targets for therapy. If none are present, the term triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is applied. A vast majority of TNBCs also express basal markers. However, the terms TNBC and basal-like breast cancer should not be considered as synonymous. The gene expression profile of the basal-like subtype of TNBC differs markedly from other breast cancer types and should biologically be regarded as a distinct type of cancer. In diagnostic routine, basal-like breast cancer is defined by immunohistochemical triple-negativity combined with presence of basal cytokeratins, for example, cytokeratins 5 and 6 and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A large study has shown that the basal-like subgroup identified by these 5 markers comprises a 9% subgroup with similar prognosis to that found in gene expression studies.There is currently no effective treatment for metastatic basal-like breast cancers. The success of EGFR inhibitors and EGFR monoclonal antibodies in treating colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer has raised hopes for efficacy in basal-like breast cancer. Unfortunately, trials have revealed that very few basal-like breast cancer patients respond to such treatments. Further research is needed to help identify potential responders for EGFR treatment, and to refine understanding of cancer-associated signaling in basal-like breast cancer, keeping the possibility of multiple pathway inhibition in mind.The cytoskeletal regulators that participate in the notably invasive behavior of basal-like cancer are largely unknown. Formins are a family of large, multi-domain proteins that remodel the actin cytoskeleton in both physiological and cancer-associated processes. The principal activity of formins is effective elongation of actin filaments. We have earlier found expression of leukocyte formin FMNL1 protein in a small number of basal-like breast cancers. However, studying cultured basal-like breast cancer cells, we have been unable to identify a significant functional role for FMNL1 (unpublished observation).Formins FHOD1 and INF2 have functional properties that distinguish them from the rest of the family. FHOD1 has no actin elongating activity, but rather caps and bundles actin filaments into stress fibers. FHOD1 has been found at actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in cultured cells. INF2 can not only polymerize actin but also depolymerize and side-bind actin filaments. Formins are generally inactive until bound by Rho GTPases. Our 2 proteins are, however, differentially regulated\u2014FHOD1 being activated through phosphorylation and INF2 possibly lacking direct regulation.FHOD1 has been studied in association with cancer. An increase of FHOD1 expression has been found in cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and knockdown has resulted in reduced migration and invasion of cultured squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and melanoma cells. INF2 is also associated with human disease. Mutations in the INF2 gene cause kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and FSGS-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. INF2 exists as 2 isoforms, with variation in the far C-terminus. The non-CAAX variant is cytosolic, while the INF2-CAAX variant is bound to endoplasmic reticulum. In vitro, INF2 has been found to participate in several specific actin- and microtubule-related processes, such as mitochondrial fission, centrosome polarization in T cells and contractility of macrophage podosomes. Recently, INF2 depletion by shRNA in the prostate cancer line DU145 was shown to reduce migration and invasion. The potential association of INF2 with clinical cancer has to our knowledge not been studied.In this study, we studied the expression of FHOD1 and INF2 in a large TNBC cohort. We found that increased expression of FHOD1 and INF2 is associated with basal-like breast cancer markers CK5/6 and EGFR. In cellular studies, we confirmed that FHOD1 is relevant for migration, invasion, and proliferation in basal-like breast cancer cells. For the first time, we showed that also INF2 participates in all these processes.Materials and MethodsPatient identificationThe study included 148 TNBCs diagnosed and treated at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, during 1998-2015. All patients were treated with surgical resection or mastectomy including sentinel node biopsy and, in case of metastatic disease, axillary evacuation. Postoperative radiation therapy and adjuvant treatments were given in accordance with international guidelines for breast cancer classification and treatment at the time of diagnosis. Preoperative adjuvant treatments were not administered. Clinical follow-up information was available from pathology reports, patient files of all patients, and Auria Biobank. The follow-up data included the established prognostic parameters of clinical breast cancer treatment, that is, axillary lymph node status, tumor size, histological grade, hormone receptor and Her2-oncogene status, proliferation marker Ki-67, and intrinsic classification as recommended in the surrogate guidelines by the 12th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference (2011) Expert Panel. Causes of death were collected from autopsy reports, death certificates, and from the Finnish Cancer Registry. The range of follow-up was from 3\u2009years 2\u2009months to 18\u2009years 0\u2009months (mean 11\u2009years 0\u2009months).All tissue materials were prepared according to basic clinical histopathology laboratory practice, that is, fixed in buffered formalin (pH 7.0) and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) comprising 2 tissue cores from the tumor of each patient. The TMAs were prepared by punching the paraffin block of each tumor using a 1.5-mm diameter cylinder. Tissue cores from non-neoplastic breast as well as hormone-positive breast cancer were included in the TMAs as controls.Of the clinicopathological parameters, the oldest part of the cohort lacked data on tumor size and proliferation index in patient journals. Tumor size was recorded for 123 cases, and tumor Ki-67 proliferation index for 126 cases.The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and the Auria Biobank. In accordance with the Finnish Biobank Act (688/2012), a separate informed consent from each patient was waived.ImmunohistochemistryTo study the expression of basal markers EGFR, CK5/6, and formins FHOD1 and INF2, the TMAs were sectioned at 3.5\u2009\u03bcm. Epidermal growth factor receptor and CK5/6 were stained with a Ventana Benchmark XT staining device and reagents from Ventana (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). FHOD1 and INF2 stainings were performed according to the streptavidin-peroxidase method using a Labvision staining device (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA). For formin stainings, rabbit anti-human polyclonal monospecific antibodies were used (FHOD1: Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MA; catalogue number HPA024468 and INF2: Proteintech, Chicago, IL; catalogue number 20466-1-AP). FHOD1 was stained using a 1:150 dilution, INF2 using a 1:500 dilution. The INF2 target sequence is present in both the INF2-CAAX and non-CAAX isoforms.Staining intensity was evaluated by 2 pathologists (NM and MG). In cases of disagreement, the cases were re-evaluated and discussed until consensus was reached. Both tissue samples from each patient were scored. CK5/6 an EGFR were scored as 0 (negative), 1 (>10% of tumor cells positive), or 2 (>50% of tumor cells positive). Any score \u2a7e1 in CK5/6 and/or EGFR staining was categorized as basal-like breast cancer. Formin FHOD1 and INF2 stainings were scored as 0 (negative), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong). The grading scheme is presented in Figure 1A.FHOD1 and INF2 immunohistochemistry in triple-negative breast cancer and in non-neoplastic breast. (A) The scoring scheme used for evaluation of FHOD1 (upper row) and INF2 (lower row) expression in breast cancer tissues. Negative staining was scored as 0. Endothelial cells were a positive internal control. Weak staining was scored as 1, intermediate as 2, and strong as 3. (B) FHOD1 and INF2 staining in lobular and ductal epithelium is generally weak or absent. In a minority of ductal cells, moderate INF2 staining is seen. Scale bar: 100\u2009\u03bcm. (C) Graphical presentation of association between FHOD1 and INF2 staining intensity sums in the TNBC samples. FHOD1 and INF2 staining intensity sums from each sample gave a score of 0 to 6. The expression of FHOD1 is indicated on the x-axis, INF2 expression as colors on the y-axis. TNBC indicates triple-negative breast cancer.Both tissue samples from each patient were evaluated, and immunohistochemical scores were summed across each sample pair to give 0 to 6 for FHOD1 and INF2, and 0 to 4 for CK5/6 and EGFR. FHOD1 and INF2 score sums 0 to 2 were regarded as negative/low expression, and sums 3 to 6 as moderate/high expression.Cell lines and culture conditionsMDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT-549 cells were from Cell Lines Service (Eppelheim, Germany). Both cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma and were not passaged longer than 6\u2009months after being received or resuscitated from frozen aliquots. Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco-BRL; Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5\u2009mM ultraglutamine, and 100\u2009U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco-BRL).Transcriptomic analysisFor an overview of FHOD1 and INF2 expression in breast cancer cell lines of different subtypes, we took advantage of the online open science resource EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas. A search for FHOD1 and INF2 expression in breast cancer cell lines retrieved data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.Transfection with small interfering RNAsFHOD1 or INF2 expression was silenced in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells using SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). Non-targeting Pool siRNA was used as a control. Cells were transfected in suspension using Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. FHOD1 or INF2 expression was silenced at 50\u2009nM siRNA concentration. For simultaneous knockdown of FHOD1 and INF2, 25\u2009nM of each siRNA was used. The knockdown efficacy was examined 72\u2009hours after transfection by immunoblotting.Western blottingCells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) supplemented with inhibitors (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009Complete Mini-protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche, Basel, Switzerland] and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009PhosStop, a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (21\u2009000\u2009g for 30\u2009minutes at 4\u00b0C). The protein concentration of lysates was determined by the Bradford method (BioRad, Berkeley, CA) before adding 5x Laemmli to samples. Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman PROTRAN, PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween) and immunoblotted with different antibodies diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST.The rabbit anti-human antibodies for FHOD1 (Sigma-Aldrich) and INF2 (Proteintech) were used at a 1:1000 and 1:2000 dilution, respectively. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:2500, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted in block solution. Mouse HRP-conjugated GADPH antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used as loading control. Membranes were washed 3 times with TBST between the different steps.Cell immunofluorescence staining and microscopyCells were plated on gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) precoated coverslips (13\u2009mm) and grown in complete medium for 24\u2009hours. These cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u2009minutes at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked with 5% BSA, 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS for 45\u2009minutes. The rabbit anti-human FHOD1 or INF2 (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich or Proteintech, respectively) antibody was incubated for 1\u2009hour at room temperature. Next, the coverslips were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen).Alexa Fluor 488- or 546-conjugated phalloidin (1:100, Invitrogen) was incubated together with the secondary antibodies to visualize filamentous actin. The mounting media contained DAPI for staining nuclei (ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI, Thermo Fisher). After each staining step, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS. Images were taken with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope and analyzed with ImageJ 1.49b software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) for quantification of changes in morphology. For Figure 3B, images were taken with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Cell area in square pixels and AR (aspect ratio; major axis/minor axis) were calculated as shape descriptors of the morphology of the cells. An increasing AR indicates an increasingly elongated shape.Erlotinib treatmentTo inhibit the EGFR signaling pathway, 70% confluent BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with serum free medium overnight followed by a 5-hour incubation in medium containing 10\u2009\u03bcM EGFR small molecule inhibitor Erlotinib (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition was verified by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-Phospho-EGF Receptor (Tyr1068) (Cell Signaling Technology). The PI3K pathway was analyzed using rabbit anti-p-Akt and rabbit anti-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibition by immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-p-ERK 1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and a rabbit anti-ERK 2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Migration, invasion, and transwell assaysIn all, 50\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells were grown overnight in 96-well Essen BioScience ImageLock microplates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI) precoated with 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL of Matrigel (Corning, Lowell, MA) in medium. Wounds were precisely made by the 96-pin Wound-Maker provided with the IncuCyte FLR (Essen Bioscience). After washing thoroughly with PBS to remove the detached cells, wounds were covered with 50\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (for invasion) or 50\u2009\u03bcL of medium (for migration). After 30\u2009min in the incubator, 100\u2009\u03bcL of complete medium was added and the cells were placed in the IncuCyte FLR. The wound images were automatically acquired from the incubator at 2-hour intervals for 48\u2009hours. The kinetics of the relative wound density was analyzed by IncuCyte software (Essen Bioscience).Single cell migration was studied by using a transwell migration assay. The 50\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells in 150\u2009\u03bcL of medium without FBS were loaded into Boyden chambers (Millipore, Temecula, CA) placed in 24 well plates containing 900\u2009\u03bcL of complete medium with 10% FBS. Cells were allowed to migrate through porous (8\u2009\u00b5m) membranes for 48\u2009hours. After medium removal, the chambers and wells were washed once with PBS. Non-migrating cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, whereas migrating cells adherent to the underside of the filter were fixed and stained with Crystal Violet solution (0.05% Crystal Violet, 1% Formaldehyde, 1% methanol, PBS) for 10\u2009minutes. The inserts were washed with water and allowed to dry overnight. To quantify the migrated cells, 1% SDS (400\u2009\u03bcL per membrane in 24 well plate) was added to solubilize the stain from cells. The plate was agitated on an orbital shaker for 30\u2009minutes until the color of the membranes was uniform. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 570\u2009nm with the Multiskan FC Machine (Thermo Scientific).Proliferation assessmentCell proliferation was evaluated by calculating the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells stained with mouse anti-Ki-67 antibody (Dako) (1:100) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen). Images were taken with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope and analyzed with ImageJ.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS, version 24 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare frequencies between groups (Triple-negative nonbasal vs Triple-negative basal-like). The Spearman correlation test was used to evaluate relationships between variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using Tukey multiple comparison procedure to identify the differences between cell treatments. Error bars represent SD or SEM, as indicated. A value of P\u2009<\u2009.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.ResultsExpression of FHOD1 and INF2 in normal breast, breast cancer, and triple-negative breast cancerNon-neoplastic breast tissue controls in the TMAs were studied to appreciate the baseline staining intensity of INF2 and FHOD1 formins in mammary epithelium. INF2 and FHOD1 staining intensity was low in non-neoplastic epithelium of breast, whereas positive INF2 and FHOD1 staining was seen in endothelium (Figure 1B). Endothelial staining was subsequently regarded as an internal positive control in the tumor samples.The TMAs also included hormone-positive cancer tissues as controls: 5 breast cancers that were ER positive. FHOD1 and INF2 expression was absent/low in 4 cases and moderate/high in 1 case. This indicates that FHOD1 and INF2 expression is not specific for triple-negative cancer but can be found in other breast cancer types as well.Among triple-negative cancers, when present, FHOD1 and INF2 staining was detected in cancer cell cytoplasm with uniform staining intensity within the tumor samples.Of the 148 TNBCs, 147 samples could be reliably assessed for basal marker and formin expression. A total of 123 (83.7%) were positive for EGFR and/or CK5/6 expression, and were grouped as basal-like cancer, while 24 (16.3%) were negative for both markers and grouped as triple-negative nonbasal cancer (Table 1). The triple-negative nonbasal cancer patients were slightly younger than the basal-like cancer patients at diagnosis (mean age 54.6 vs 61.3\u2009years, P\u2009=\u2009.05). There was no significant difference between tumor size, proliferation, or prevalence of lymph node metastases at surgery.Characteristics of study population.Variable\t\tTriple-negative nonbasal, n\u2009=\u200924\tTriple-negative basal-like, n\u2009=\u2009123\tP\t \t\t\tN or mean\t% or SD\tN or mean\t% or SD\t \tAge at surgery (y)\t\t54.6\t9.8\t61.3\t16.2\t.050\t \tTumor diameter (mm)\t\t24.7\t16.3\t25.4\t13.2\t.813\t \tKi-67 index (%)\t\t43.3\t24.7\t51.4\t20.9\t.140\t \tLymph node positive\t\t7\t30.4\t40\t32.5\t.844\t \tFHOD1\tModerate/high\t3\t12.5\t44\t35.8\t.030\t \t\tNegative/low\t21\t87.5\t79\t64.2\t\t \tINF2\tModerate/high\t7\t29.2\t70\t56.9\t.015\t \t\tNegative/low\t17\t70.8\t53\t43.1\t\t \tStatistically significant p-values are indicated in bold.The expression of FHOD1 and INF2 differed between the nonbasal and basal-like TNBCs. Moderate/high expression of FHOD1 was significantly more common among basal-like cancers than triple-negative nonbasal cancers (35.8% vs 12.5%, P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.05). Moderate/high INF2 expression was also significantly more common among basal-like cancers (56.9% vs 29.2%, P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.05). Breast cancer specific survival was similar in FHOD1/INF2 moderate/high and negative/low groups, suggesting that the expression level of these formins does not have practical prognostic utility.Next, we asked whether the FHOD1 or INF2 expression levels (0-6) among TNBCs associated with expression of basal markers EGFR or CK5/6 (0-4), tumor size, proliferation, or lymph node metastasis. A significant positive correlation was found between several of these variables using Spearman Rho test (Table 2). Not unexpectedly, a positive correlation between tumor size and Ki-67 proliferation index as well as lymph node metastasis was found. Another anticipated finding was a correlation between expression levels of the 2 basal markers EGFR and CK5/6. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression level furthermore covaried with the Ki-67 index. Interestingly, FHOD1 and INF2 expression highly significantly correlated with each other as well as with EGFR expression (P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.001). Of the 2 formins, only FHOD1 significantly correlated with CK5/6 expression (P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.05). A correlation between INF2 expression and Ki-67 index was also noted. The association between FHOD1 and INF2 immunohistochemical score sums is illustrated in Figure 1C.Correlations between expression of FHOD1, INF2, EGFR, CK5/6, Ki-67, tumor size, and LN metastasis in TNBC.\t\tFHOD1\tINF2\tEGFR\tCK5/6\tKi-67\tTumor size\tLN status\t \tFHOD1\tCorrelation coefficient\t\t0.454**\t0.365**\t0.192*\t\u22120.022\t\u22120.025\t0.022\t \t\tSig.

We found that the expression was highly variable across cell lines of different types. FHOD1 and INF2 expressions were to some extent found in cell lines of all studied subtypes. The mRNA levels of FHOD1 and INF2 were higher in the basal-like cell line MDA-MB-231 than in BT-549. FHOD1 and INF2 mRNA levels in cell lines of different phenotypes and expression patterns according to Kao et al are presented in Figure 2.Expression of FHOD1 and INF2 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines of different type. FHOD1 and INF2 mRNA expression is not specific for basal-like breast cancer cell lines. Expression is found in all subtypes at variable levels. TPM indicates transcripts per million.Next, we focused our functional studies on 2 basal-like breast cancer cell lines that express FHOD1 and INF2. The cell lines BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 have a basal-like transcriptional signature. In western blotting of lysates from these cell lines, bands of expected molecular weight were detected using both FHOD1 and INF2 antibodies. Of the 2 cell lines, higher expression of INF2 protein was found in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Immunofluorescence double staining of BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells with phalloidin and either anti-FHOD1 or anti-INF2 and showed endogenous FHOD1 and INF2 to be localized in the cytoplasm, mostly as small dots. Co-localization of FHOD1 and INF2 and actin filament bundles was clear (Figure 3A and B). No association of FHOD1 or INF2 with invadopodia-like ventral actin structures was observed.Localization of FHOD1 and INF2 in basal-like breast cancer cell lines. (A) FHOD1 (red) is mostly seen as cytoplasmic dots in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Clear co-localization with actin filament bundles (green) can be seen. (B) INF2 (red) is also distributed as dots in the cytoplasm. Co-localization with actin filaments (green) is present in both cell lines. Right panel shows higher magnification images of the marked (white box) areas.FHOD1 and INF2 expression is not dependent on MAPK-, PI3K-, or EGFR activity in basal-like breast cancer cellsWe have shown previously that FHOD1 expression depends on active PI3K signaling but not MAPK signaling in cultured oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells and melanoma cell lines. To investigate whether similar regulation is found in basal-like breast cancer, we treated BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MAPK inhibitor U0126.Western blotting showed that in BT-549 cells, both PI3K and MAPK signaling was active; pAkt and pMAPK bands were present in western blotting. In MDA-MB-231 cell, a strong pMAPK band was present, but no pAkt band, indicating that MAPK signaling but not PI3K signaling was active.We found that addition of U0126 or LY294002 efficiently inhibited MAPK and PI3K signaling as seen by loss of pMAPK and pAkt bands, respectively. Inhibition of these pathways did not influence the intensity of FHOD1 and INF2 bands, indicating that the expression of FHOD1 and INF2 is independent of MAPK and PI3K signaling in these cell lines (not shown).Next, we asked whether EGFR activity is a prerequisite for FHOD1 and INF2 expression. To test this, BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the EGFR small molecule inhibitor erlotinib for 5\u2009hours. The treatment efficiently reduced phosphorylation of EGFR as studied by western blotting. However, the FHOD1 and INF2 expression levels remained unchanged (not shown). Our findings suggest that EGFR activity does not under these circumstances regulate the expression of FHOD1 and INF2.Effects of FHOD1 and INF2 silencing on breast cancer cell morphology, migration, and invasionTo explore the functional roles of FHOD1 and INF2 in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with siRNA either targeting FHOD1 or INF2, or with control siRNA. The efficiency of knockdown was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 4A). Knockdown of FHOD1 or INF2 did not reduce expression of the other. This suggests that these formins are not dependent on each other for expression.Knockdown of FHOD1 and INF2 expression is accompanied by morphological and functional alterations in basal-like breast cancer cell lines. (A) Western blotting confirms that the expression of both formins is markedly reduced by siRNA treatment. (B) Quantification of Transwell migration experiments show that migration is significantly reduced in both cell lines on knockdown of FHOD1 or INF2. (C) The cell area significantly increases on FHOD1 or INF2 knockdown in BT-549 cells as compared with control cells. Cellular axis ratio is decreased, indicating that cells were less elongated and more round than control cells. The reduction of axis ratio is statistically significant only for INF2 knockdown. (D) Knockdown of INF2 alters the morphology of MDA-MB-231 cells in a similar way: cell area and roundness are increased. FHOD1 knockdown has a minor effect on morphology in this cell line. (E) Graph illustrating wound confluence of BT-549 cells as a function of time. Wound healing and invasion is significantly slower after FHOD1 and INF2 depletion. (F) Graphs from wound healing and invasion assays using MDA-MB-231 cells. Wound healing and invasion is slower in FHOD1 or INF2 knockdown groups than control cells. (G) The proliferation index, measured as percent of Ki-67 positive cells, is reduced by FHOD1 and especially by INF2 depletion. Error bars indicate standard deviation. AR indicates axis ratio; OD, standardised extracted crystal violet optical density; px, pixels.*P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.05; **P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.01; ***P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.001.To test whether single cell migration was influenced by FHOD1 or INF2 knockdown, a Boyden chamber migration assay was conducted. In this assay, we found that that BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells migrated less efficiently after FHOD1 or INF2 knockdown. The reduction was statistically significant in both BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells when compared with control siRNA treated cells (P\u2009<\u2009.05 and P\u2009<\u2009.01, respectively; Figure 4B).Next, we wanted to quantify the change in cell morphology. Roundness was described by calculating an axis ratio, where the length of the cell long axis is divided by the short axis. Statistically significant increases of cell areas and roundness were detected in INF2 knockdown in both cell lines. FHOD1 knockdown had a modest effect on morphology and a trend of increased roundness and area was seen, but only the increase of cell area in BT-549 cells reached statistical significance.To further test FHOD1 and INF2 knockdown effects on cell motility and invasion, a wound healing experiment and invasion assay using Matrigel as matrix was conducted using the Incucyte system. This method enables monitoring of conventional 2-dimensional wound healing and cell invasion into a Matrigel plug. For this experiment, we also carried out double knockdown of both FHOD1 and INF2. In this assay, we found a healing delay as well as reduced invasion in comparison with control cells in both FHOD1 and INF2 depleted cells. The double knockdown cells healed the wound and invaded similarly as INF2 or FHOD1 depleted cells. No significant additional effect was detected. The reduction of wound healing and invasion was statistically significant for all siRNA treatments in both BT-549 cells (Figure 4E) and MDA-M-231 cells (Figure 4F) (P\u2009\u2a7d\u2009.01, ANOVA).FHOD1 and INF2 knockdown reduces proliferationAs immunohistochemical analysis indicated a correlation between INF2 expression and tumor cell proliferation, we wanted to test this link in vitro. For this purpose, FHOD1 and INF2 depleted cells and control cells were stained with proliferation marker Ki-67. The percentage of Ki-67 positive nuclei was calculated in each group. A marked reduction of proliferation was seen in the INF2 (P\u2009<\u2009.01) and FHOD1 (P\u2009<\u2009.05) depleted cells. The reduction was highly similar in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4G).DiscussionOf the breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has the highest probability of recurrence but still awaits the targeted therapies available for most other breast cancers. It is therefore of crucial importance to better understand the biology of TNBC and reveal the mechanisms that drive its aggressive behavior. Although it is known that alterations in cytoskeletal components contribute to cell migration, invasion, and cell survival, their expression and functions in TNBC is still poorly studied.Here we characterized a large set of TNBC tumors is for expression of basal-like markers and the formin proteins FHOD1 and INF2. Both formins have been the focus of intense research in vitro but have barely been studied at the protein level in clinical cancer. We found that FHOD1 and INF2 are frequently overexpressed in TNBC in comparison with normal epithelium and are associated with presence of markers for the basal-like subgroup, above all the expression of EGFR. We further describe the very similar effects of FHOD1 or INF2 depletion on basal-like breast cancer cell lines BT-549 and MDA-MB-231: rounder cell shape, inferior capacity to migrate/invade, and reduced proliferation.A profound change of cell morphology, from cobblestone-like to elongated, mesenchymal-like is required when cells migrate, invade, and metastasize. Such a transition requires substantial rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, a process made possible through EMT. In a study on a TNBC cell line, Jurmeister et al found that FHOD1 is a target of the EMT repressing miRNA-200c. Furthermore, they found an inverse correlation of miRNA-200c and FHOD1 mRNA in breast cancer samples. However, it has not been established whether FHOD1 protein is expressed in clinical TNBC. We found that 32% of our sample of TNBCs overexpress FHOD1. Patients with high versus low FHOD1 expression did not, however, differ in survival analysis. Thus, progression of TNBC is clearly not entirely dependent on overexpression of FHOD1. Nevertheless, the results from this study show that in a subgroup of TNBC patients, FHOD1 is overexpressed and may consequently partly mediate the cytoskeletal change required for invasion.On a cellular level, we found that knockdown of FHOD1 in 2 basal-like breast cancer cell lines resulted in larger cell areas and inferior capacity to migrate, invade, and proliferate. These results are in line with previous studies identifying FHOD1 as a key player in maintaining elongated cell shape and migration. Furthermore, in basal-like breast cancer cells, FHOD1 expression has further been linked to EMT and invasion. Our previous study on a melanoma xenograft model showed that FHOD1 plays an important role in tumor growth and tumor cell proliferation in vivo, and that FHOD1 depletion was accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Taken together, the results from these studies suggest that FHOD1 has very similar effects on cell morphology, motility, and possibly also proliferation across different cell types.Germline INF2 mutations have previously been associated with human disease. A mutation in the INF2 gene causes kidney and peripheral nerve disease. INF2 expression or function has, to our knowledge, not previously been studied in clinical cancer. In samples from non-neoplastic breast, we found that INF2 expression was low. In the TNBC cohort, however, 52% had moderate/high INF2 expression. INF2 overexpression was even more common among the basal-like TNBCs (57%). Of interest, we found a clear positive correlation of INF2 expression with both EGFR expression and proliferation index. In cell studies, we found that INF2 knockdown was accompanied by significant decrease of proliferation. This association is to our knowledge a novel finding. We have not yet studied the molecular basis of this reduction further. However, a potential mechanism could be the actin-mediated effects that formins have on transcription. Both FHOD1 and INF2 can, through their effect on the globular actin pool, activate the serum response factor (SRF). The SRF activates transcription from a multitude of cytoskeleton- and even cell cycle-associated genes. The association of FHOD1 with SRF activation has been shown in MDA-MB-231 basal-like breast cancer cells, and for INF2 in retinal pigmented epithelial cell line RPE-1. Whether FHOD1 and INF2 generally participate in maintaining proliferation in cell lines, and whether this is a direct mechanism of formins or mediated by indirect, actin-mediated alteration of transcription remains to be discovered.In addition, we found that INF2 silencing had very similar effects on cell morphology and function as seen in FHOD1 depletion: an increase in cell area and roundness and a reduced capacity to migrate and invade. Simultaneous knockdown of both INF2 and FHOD1 was also conducted but without evidence for additive effect on morphology, migration, or invasion. This suggests that the formins regulate different aspects of a common process. Such interplay has been reported previously: In macrophages, FHOD1 and INF2 were both found in the actin-rich and contractile adhesion structures, that is, macrophage podosomes. FHOD1 was found to mediate actomyosin contractility between podosomes, while INF2 regulated intra-podosomal contractility. Both proteins were necessary for efficient de novo formation of podosomes. In addition to the lack of synergistic effect of knockdown, we are inclined to think that the prevalent co-expression of FHOD1 and INF2 in clinical samples supports the idea of alliance. Nevertheless, extensive future studies are essential to confirm significance and detailed mechanism of the interplay between FHOD1 and INF2 in basal-like breast cancer.The regulation of FHOD1 and INF2 expression is incompletely characterized. FHOD1 has been found to be a target of miRNAs in breast cancer EMT, where TGF\u03b2-induced EMT was found to be mediated by FHOD1. Furthermore, FHOD1 has been found to be induced by EMT-associated transcription factors Snail and ZEB1 in squamous cell carcinoma cells.. In the same cell line, inhibition of PI3K signaling markedly reduced FHOD1 expression. Here, we found that in clinical TNBC samples, FHOD1 and INF2 expression clearly correlated with EGFR. We considered that EGFR activity might be an upstream regulating factor. However, inhibiting EGFR activity with erlotinib in basal-like cell lines did not reduce FHOD1 or INF2 expression. Our results suggest that FHOD1 and INF2 expression does not rely on EGFR activity in basal-like breast cancer. Inhibition of PI3K and MAPK signaling was equally ineffective, which suggests that the regulation of formin expression is most likely complex and can vary between cell types. EMT-associated transcription factors or miRNAs were not addressed in this study, and they remain possible candidates for further investigation.The treatment of TNBC includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy\u2014no targeted treatment is available. Intensive TNBC research aims to elucidate the mechanistic underspinning of its rapid proliferation and poor prognosis, as well as find potential targets for therapy. The cytoskeleton itself as well as cell migration and EMT are potential future therapeutic targets in TNBC. This study shows that 2 formin proteins, FHOD1 and INF2, are not only associated with migration, invasion, and proliferation of cultured cells but are also frequently present at an increased level in TNBC tissue, especially in basal-like cancer. This finding should stimulate formin research, particularly pharmacologic, aiming to inhibit the activity of specific formins in TNBC.ConclusionsIn this study, we report that clinical TNBCs that express markers of basal-like differentiation frequently overexpress actin-regulating proteins FHOD1 and INF2. We further show that knockdown of FHOD1 and INF2 in basal-like breast cancer cells alters their shape, reduces migration and invasion, and further attenuates proliferation activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that FHOD1 and INF2 have a significant role in the malignant behavior of basal-like breast cancer. Their expression may bring about properties that mediate migration, invasion, and proliferation. Accordingly, they are potential targets for pharmacologic inhibition in basal-like cancer.Author Contributions: VDH, MG, and OC planned the study. VDH and MG drafted the manuscript.
