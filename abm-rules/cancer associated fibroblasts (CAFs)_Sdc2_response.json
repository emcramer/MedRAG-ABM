    "## Potential Rules for Syndecan-2 (Sdc2) in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules for Syndecan-2 (Sdc2) in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) based on the provided documents, formatted as requested: **Rule 1:** In CAFs, contact with MDA-MB-231 cells decreases Sdc2 expression. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that MDA-MB-231 cells treated with exogenous heparan sulfate or heparin exhibit a decrease in syndecan-2 expression. This suggests that MDA-MB-231 cells may directly or indirectly influence the expression of Sdc2 in CAFs. **Rule 2:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression increases resistance to deformation. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that depletion of Sdc2 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to increased cell spreading and microfilament bundle formation, suggesting that Sdc2 may play a role in maintaining cell shape and resisting deformation. **Rule 3:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression decreases migration speed. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that depletion of Sdc2 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to increased cell spreading and microfilament bundle formation, which are associated with increased cell motility. This suggests that Sdc2 may play a role in regulating cell migration speed. **Rule 4:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression decreases invasion. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that depletion of Sdc2 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to reduced invasion of type I collagen gels. This suggests that Sdc2 may play a role in inhibiting cell invasion. **Rule 5:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression decreases the secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that depletion of Sdc2 in MDA-MB-231 cells leads to increased cell spreading and microfilament bundle formation, which are associated with increased cell motility and invasion. This suggests that Sdc2 may play a role in regulating the secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors that promote cell migration and invasion. **Rule 6:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression increases the expression of caveolin-2. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that syndecan-2 interacts with caveolin-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. This suggests that Sdc2 may regulate the expression of caveolin-2. **Rule 7:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that syndecan-2 expression is elevated in metastatic breast tumors compared to normal mammary tissue. This suggests that Sdc2 may be associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. **Rule 8:** In CAFs, high Sdc2 expression is associated with a poorer prognosis for TNBC patients. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that syndecan-2 expression is elevated in metastatic breast tumors compared to normal mammary tissue. This suggests that Sdc2 may be associated with a poorer prognosis for TNBC patients. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and may not be exhaustive. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Sdc2 in CAFs and its impact on TNBC progression. "
