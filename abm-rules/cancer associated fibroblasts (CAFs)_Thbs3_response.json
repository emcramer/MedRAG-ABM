    "## Potential Rules for Thbs3 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thbs3 decreases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Thrombospondin-3 (Thbs3) has been shown to act as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in the breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression [Document 8]. This suggests that Thbs3 may suppress the activation of CAFs, which are known to promote tumor growth and invasion. The Hill response reflects the potential for a sigmoidal relationship between Thbs3 concentration and CAF activation, with a steep decrease in activation at higher Thbs3 levels. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thbs3 increases transform to epithelial from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Thbs3 has been shown to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which is a key driver of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [Document 8]. EMT is often associated with CAF activation and increased invasiveness. Therefore, Thbs3 may promote the reversion of CAFs to a more epithelial phenotype, potentially reducing their pro-tumorigenic activity. The Hill response reflects the potential for a sigmoidal relationship between Thbs3 concentration and CAF reversion, with a steep increase in reversion at higher Thbs3 levels. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thbs3 decreases collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) secretion from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Thbs3 has been shown to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which is a key driver of collagen production in CAFs [Document 8]. Collagen deposition is a hallmark of CAF activation and contributes to the dense stroma that surrounds tumors. Therefore, Thbs3 may reduce collagen production by CAFs, potentially reducing the physical barrier to drug penetration and immune cell infiltration. The Hill response reflects the potential for a sigmoidal relationship between Thbs3 concentration and collagen production, with a steep decrease in production at higher Thbs3 levels. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Thbs3 decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Thbs3 has been shown to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which is a key driver of CAF migration [Document 8]. CAFs are known to be highly motile and contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, Thbs3 may reduce CAF migration, potentially reducing their ability to promote tumor spread. The Hill response reflects the potential for a sigmoidal relationship between Thbs3 concentration and migration speed, with a steep decrease in speed at higher Thbs3 levels. **Note:** These rules are based on the available information in the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. Further research and validation are needed to refine these rules and to incorporate additional factors that may influence the behavior of CAFs in the context of triple-negative breast cancer. "
