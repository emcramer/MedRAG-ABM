    "## Potential Rules for Lamb2 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Lamb2 increases anoikis resistance. **Justification:** Document [48] demonstrates that invasive breast cancer cells induce laminin-332 (Lamb2) upregulation in myofibroblasts, leading to anoikis resistance. This suggests that Lamb2 acts as a survival signal for CAFs in the context of tumor invasion. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Lamb2 increases Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that Lamb2 binding to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on myofibroblasts activates an autocrine cell survival signal mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. This suggests that Lamb2 can directly influence intracellular signaling pathways in CAFs. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Lamb2 increases Rac1 activation. **Justification:** Document [48] demonstrates that integrin \u03b24 neoexpression, induced by invasive breast cancer cells, promotes anoikis resistance in fibroblasts through Rac1 activation, independent of laminin-332. This suggests that Lamb2 may indirectly influence Rac1 activation in CAFs through the upregulation of integrin \u03b24. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Lamb2 decreases fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions. **Justification:** Document [48] shows that integrin \u03b24 neoexpression, induced by invasive breast cancer cells, suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions. This suggests that Lamb2 may indirectly influence fibroblast aggregation in CAFs through the upregulation of integrin \u03b24. **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Lamb2 increases expression of integrin \u03b24. **Justification:** Document [48] demonstrates that invasive breast cancer cells induce integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts. This suggests that Lamb2 may directly or indirectly influence the expression of integrin \u03b24 in CAFs. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and may need further refinement based on specific experimental data and the context of your model.
