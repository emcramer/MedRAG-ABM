    "## Potential Rules for Igf1 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Igf1 increases cycle entry. **Justification:** Igf1 is a potent growth factor that promotes cell proliferation. Several studies have shown that Igf1 can stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts, including CAFs. For example, in document [21], it was found that exposure of WI-38 fibroblasts to CM from induced MCF10A-MycER cells or to IGF-II upregulated FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397, as well as the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), features associated with CAF phenotype and increased cell migratory/invasive behavior. This suggests that Igf1 can promote the proliferation of CAFs, which would lead to an increase in their numbers within the tumor microenvironment. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Igf1 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Igf1 can also promote cell migration. In document [2], it was found that the crosstalk between CAFs and BC cells increases the secretion of IGF-1 in CAFs and PAI-1 activity in cancer cells. Both IGF1 and PAI-1 activate RhoA/ROCK signaling in cancer cells, which increases cell scattering and invasion. This suggests that Igf1 can promote the migration of CAFs, which would allow them to move more readily within the tumor microenvironment and potentially contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Igf1 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Igf1 can also promote the activation of fibroblasts. In document [2], it was found that the crosstalk between CAFs and BC cells increases the secretion of IGF-1 in CAFs and PAI-1 activity in cancer cells. Both IGF1 and PAI-1 activate RhoA/ROCK signaling in cancer cells, which increases cell scattering and invasion. This suggests that Igf1 can promote the activation of CAFs, which would lead to an increase in their pro-tumorigenic activity. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Igf1 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. **Justification:** Igf1 can also promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. In document [21], it was found that exposure of WI-38 fibroblasts to CM from induced MCF10A-MycER cells or to IGF-II upregulated FAK phosphorylation on Tyr397, as well as the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), features associated with CAF phenotype and increased cell migratory/invasive behavior. This suggests that Igf1 can promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by CAFs, which would contribute to the inflammatory environment within the tumor microenvironment and potentially promote tumor growth and metastasis. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Igf1 increases transform to M2. **Justification:** Igf1 can also promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. In document [12], it was found that the IL1\u03b2-IL1R signaling is involved in the stimulatory effects triggered by hypoxia in breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This suggests that Igf1 can promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, which would contribute to the immunosuppressive environment within the tumor microenvironment and potentially promote tumor growth and metastasis. **Note:** These rules are based on the information provided in the documents and may need to be adjusted based on further research and specific model parameters.
