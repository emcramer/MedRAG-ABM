    "I apologize, but I cannot provide any rules for the interaction of Cadm1 with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) based on the provided documents. The provided documents do not contain any information about Cadm1 or its role in the context of CAFs or breast cancer. To generate rules for Cadm1 and CAFs, you would need to consult research papers specifically focused on this interaction. You can search PubMed using keywords like \"Cadm1,\" \"cancer-associated fibroblasts,\" \"breast cancer,\" and \"tumor microenvironment.\" Once you have identified relevant research papers, you can use the provided format to create rules for your agent-based model. For example, if a paper found that Cadm1 promotes CAF migration towards the tumor, you could write a rule like: \"In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Cadm1 increases migration speed towards malignant epithelial cells.\" Remember to always cite the source of your information in the justification.
