    "## Potential Rules for Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) and CCL8: **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL8 increases migration speed. **Justification:** CCL8 is a chemoattractant for various cell types, including breast cancer cells and macrophages. [6, 12, 46] This suggests that CAFs may become more motile in response to CCL8, potentially to move towards a CCL8 gradient. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL8 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** CCL8 has been shown to promote the activation of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. [26, 46] This suggests that CAFs may become more activated in response to CCL8, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL8 increases IL-8 secretion. **Justification:** CCL8 has been shown to mediate crosstalk between endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and triple-negative breast cancer cells through IL-8. [6] This suggests that CAFs may increase IL-8 secretion in response to CCL8, potentially contributing to a positive feedback loop that promotes tumor growth and metastasis. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL8 increases MMP-2 secretion. **Justification:** CCL8 has been shown to enhance the MMP-2 secretion of ECFCs in response to TNBC cells. [6] This suggests that CAFs may increase MMP-2 secretion in response to CCL8, potentially contributing to ECM remodeling and tumor invasion. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL8 increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** CCL8 has been shown to induce the differentiation of monocytes into M2-like macrophages. [9] This suggests that CAFs may shift towards the M2 phenotype in response to CCL8, potentially contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor growth. **Rule 6:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL8 decreases immunogenicity to T cells. **Justification:** CCL8 has been shown to promote the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the lungs of mice bearing metastatic primary tumors. [48] Tregs are immunosuppressive cells that can inhibit the activity of T cells. This suggests that CAFs may become less immunogenic to T cells in response to CCL8, potentially contributing to immune evasion and tumor growth. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for designing your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific research question and the specific triple-negative breast cancer model you are using. "
