Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. ***p \u2264 0.001 using \u0394Ct valuesTo evaluate the effect of COX-2 expression on structural ECM changes, we characterized Col1 fiber distribution in 1 mm-thick fresh tumor slices using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel).

Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

        "content": "Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) have poor prognoses despite aggressive treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are prominent in tumour stroma. Our hypothesis was that CAFs modulate chemotherapy sensitivity. TNBC cells and breast fibroblasts were cultured; survival after chemotherapeutics was assessed using luciferase or clonogenic assays. Signalling was investigated using transcriptomics, reporters, recombinant proteins and blocking antibodies. Clinical relevance was investigated using immunohistochemistry. Breast CAFs dose-dependently protected TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157, but not MDA-MB-468s, from chemotherapy. CAF-induced protection was associated with interferon (IFN) activation. CAFs were induced to express IFN\u03b21 by chemotherapy and TNBC co-culture, leading to paracrine activation in cancer cells. Recombinant IFNs were sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 but not MDA-MB-468 cells. In TNBC patients, IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs correlated with cancer cell expression of MX1, a marker of activated IFN signalling. High expression of IFN\u03b21 (CAFs) or MX1 (tumour cells) correlated with reduced survival after chemotherapy, especially in claudin-low tumours (which MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells represent). Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection. CAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.",

Our hypothesis was that CAFs modulate chemotherapy sensitivity.MethodsTNBC cells and breast fibroblasts were cultured; survival after chemotherapeutics was assessed using luciferase or clonogenic assays. Signalling was investigated using transcriptomics, reporters, recombinant proteins and blocking antibodies. Clinical relevance was investigated using immunohistochemistry.ResultsBreast CAFs dose-dependently protected TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157, but not MDA-MB-468s, from chemotherapy. CAF-induced protection was associated with interferon (IFN) activation. CAFs were induced to express IFN\u03b21 by chemotherapy and TNBC co-culture, leading to paracrine activation in cancer cells. Recombinant IFNs were sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 but not MDA-MB-468 cells. In TNBC patients, IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs correlated with cancer cell expression of MX1, a marker of activated IFN signalling. High expression of IFN\u03b21 (CAFs) or MX1 (tumour cells) correlated with reduced survival after chemotherapy, especially in claudin-low tumours (which MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells represent). Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0028. (C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008). (C) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the basal expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs compared with CAFs. Data are shown as relative expression of miRNAs folded on NFs. Standard deviations were calculated with replicates from two independent experiments performed on four different primary NF cells (pt. #1, #2, #3, and #4) and four different primary CAF cells (pt. #81, #82, #87, and #89). The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes.

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0049. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

        "content": "Tumor initiation and progression are not only ascribed to the behavior of cancer cells, but also profoundly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Inside, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have become key factors to accelerate growth and metastasis for the abundance in most solid tumors. Our group previously reported that Oroxylin A (OA), a flavone from Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, possess the ability to suppress growth and invasion of several tumor cells. However, the regulatory effect of OA on stromal microenvironment is poorly understood. In this study, breast cancer-induced fibroblasts and primary breast CAFs from MMTV-PyMT mice were used to evaluate the influence of OA on the activation of fibroblasts. Results showed that OA could decrease the expression of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Thus, OA-deactivated CAFs did not further promote the proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments, OA could also impede tumor metastasis through exhausting progressive CAFs. Mechanically, OA could specifically bind ACTN1 and significantly inhibit its expression to prevent CAF activation. As a consequence, OA could decrease the phosphorylation of FAK and STAT3, and reduce the secretion of CCL2 in CAFs. Altogether, OA could remodel stromal microenvironment and it is a potential therapeutic agent in breast cancer.",

In this study, we mined the prognostic role of BMP antagonists GREMLIN 1 (GREM1) in primary breast cancer tissues using in-house and publicly available datasets. We determined which cells express GREM1 RNA using in situ hybridization (ISH) on a breast cancer tissue microarray. The effects of Grem1 on the properties of breast cancer cells were assessed by measuring the mesenchymal/stem cell marker expression and functional cell-based assays for stemness and invasion. The role of Grem1 in breast cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation was measured by analyzing the expression of fibroblast markers, phalloidin staining, and collagen contraction assays. The role of Grem1 in CAF-induced breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation was studied by utilizing xenograft zebrafish breast cancer (co-) injection models. Expression analysis of clinical breast cancer datasets revealed that high expression of GREM1 in breast cancer stroma is correlated with a poor prognosis regardless of the molecular subtype. The large majority of human breast cancer cell lines did not express GREM1 in vitro, but breast CAFs did express GREM1 both in vitro and in vivo. Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) secreted by breast cancer cells, and also inflammatory cytokines, stimulated GREM1 expression in CAFs. Grem1 abrogated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling in breast cancer cells and promoted their mesenchymal phenotype, stemness, and invasion. Moreover, Grem1 production by CAFs strongly promoted the fibrogenic activation of CAFs and promoted breast cancer cell intravasation and extravasation in co-injection xenograft zebrafish models.

The tumor stroma consists of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs); vascular, inflammatory, and immune cells; and extracellular matrix (ECM) residing within or in the vicinity of a tumor. CAFs are differentiated from quiescent fibroblasts and are associated with increased expression of myofibroblastic markers, such as vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1, also known as S100A4). Tumors, including those from the breast, often display desmoplasia (a fibrillar network) that is mainly caused by CAFs, in that they produce and remodel ECM components, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The increased stiffness and abnormal physical structure of the ECM can promote tumor cell growth and metastatic dissemination and are also critical for the generation and maintenance of the CAF phenotype.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted growth factors that belong to the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) family. Signaling by BMPs is initiated by binding their cognate transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, which triggers the phosphorylation of intracellular SMAD1/5/8 (R-SMADs). Activated R-SMADs can form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4 that accumulate in the nucleus, where they can regulate transcriptional responses in concert with other DNA-binding transcription factors. BMP signaling can elicit diverse and complex biological processes in development and disease, including cancer. Many secreted BMP antagonists, which sequester BMP ligands and prevent their binding to receptors, have been identified. Accumulating evidence indicates that several cancer types show dysregulated BMP signaling caused by a disequilibrium of BMPs and their antagonists. For example, BMP antagonists such as Noggin, Follistatin, and Chordin like (Chrdl)1 have been linked to induce osteoclast differentiation and promote osteolytic bone metastases. The BMP antagonist Coco permits a few dormant breast cancer cells to escape the quiescent state imposed by BMP signaling and thereby establish metastases.Gremlin (Grem) 1 is a highly conserved glycoprotein belonging to the Cerberus and Dan subfamily of secreted BMP antagonists. It preferentially interacts with BMP2, 4, and 7. Grem1 is the major BMP antagonist that maintains proper outgrowth and patterning during vertebral limb development. Grem1 expression is also essential for cellular proliferation and branching morphogenesis in lung development and in kidney organogenesis. Aberrant expression in adults is associated with orofacial clefting, osteoarthritis, spontaneous bone fractures, and liver, lung, and renal fibrosis. Grem1-mediated proangiogenic and proinflammatory activity appears to be independent of its effects on BMP.In several cancers, Grem1 reduces the negative effect of BMPs on stemness, proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. In hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome, GREM1 is predominantly expressed in the epithelium of the large bowel, where it disrupts homeostatic intestinal morphogen gradients and initiates colonic tumorigenesis. GREM1 was also detected at the colorectal cancer desmoplastic invasion front, highlighting a potential role in cancer metastasis. High levels of GREM1 gene expression were observed in the stromal fibroblasts of many types of cancer, suggesting that CAFs are a potential source of Grem1. However, the effects of Grem1 on CAFs\u2019 function and on the interaction between (breast) cancer cells and fibroblasts are unclear.The results presented here support the idea that Grem1 is a clinical predictor of a poor prognosis in breast cancer. Mechanistically, Grem1 produced by CAFs promoted fibroblast activation in an autocrine manner and stimulated breast cancer cell stemness and invasion in a paracrine manner. Grem1 could be an attractive therapeutic target to interfere with breast cancer progression.MethodsData mining of gene expression in clinical patient samples and 52 breast cancer cell linesIn-house and publicly available gene expression datasets GSE2034, GSE5327, GSE2990, GSE7390, and GSE11121 were used for GREM1 (and transforming growth factor \u03b21/2/3 (TGFB1/2/3), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1B), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNFA)) expression in lymph node-negative, non-(neo-)adjuvant-treated primary breast cancer patients with available metastasis-free survival data, leading to a cohort of 867 patients. Using the GSE41313 dataset, GREM1, BMP, and BMP receptor expression was assessed in silico in 52 breast cancer cell lines. Breast cancer dataset GSE14548 was investigated to explore the GREM1 expression in breast epithelium and stroma; this dataset was obtained using tissues from normal breast; grade I, II, and III ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive breast cancer tissues that were micro-dissected using a laser capture technique. In addition, the colorectal cancer dataset GSE39396 was analyzed for GREM1 expression; epithelial cells, leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells were isolated by flow cytometry. Data were gathered from Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Raw.cel files were processed using frozen robust multiarray analysis (fRMA) parameters (median polish), after which the batch effects were corrected using ComBat.GREM1 RNA in situ hybridization (ISH)A matched breast cancer, adjacent (adenosis or hyperplasia, and cancer free) and adjacent normal tissue microarray (TMA) was purchased from US Biomax (BR724). GREM1 RNA in situ hybridization was conducted with an RNAscope GREM1 Probe (312831-C2, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) and a 2.5 HD Detection Kit \u2013 BROWN (322300, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). All procedures were performed by strictly following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The ISH results were scanned by a digital slide scanner (Pannoramic 250 Flash III, 3DHISTECH). The presence of intracellular brown punctate dots was considered as positive staining. The signal intensity was scored utilizing a 5-point system: 0, no signals visible; 1, weak signals barely visible; 2, visible signals but not intensive; 3, moderate intensive signals; and 4, intensive signals. Scoring was evaluated independently by two observers with similar outcomes.Cell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were purchased from ATCC. The human human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized breast CAFs 19TT cells have been previously described. Human foreskin fibroblasts were obtained from Arti A. Ramkisoensing and have been previously published. These cell lines and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, 11965092, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 16000044, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100\u2009U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep, 15140148, Thermo Fisher Scientific). MCF10A (M1) human breast epithelial cell line and MCF10A-derived cell line MCF10A-Ras (M2) were generously provided by Dr. Fred Miller (Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, USA); both cell lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (11039047, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% horse serum (26050088, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 20\u2009ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, 01-107, Merck Millipore), 10\u2009mg/ml insulin (91077C, Sigma-Aldrich), 100\u2009ng/ml cholera enterotoxin (C8052, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5\u2009mg/ml hydrocortisone (H0135, Sigma-Aldrich), and 100\u2009U/ml Pen/Strep. Human mesenchymal (HM), W18, and W21 fetal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated and previously described and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) \u03b1 (32561037, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS, 100\u2009U/ml Pen/Strep. All cell lines were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2, humidified incubator. All fibroblasts and MSCs were routinely cultured in 0.2% gelatin-coated (G9136, Sigma-Aldrich) flasks or plates during the whole experiment period to avoid possible activation caused by physical rigidity. All cell lines were monthly tested to verify the absence of mycoplasma, and human cell lines were authenticated by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.Plasmids, lentiviral transduction, and generation of stable cell linesThe human GREM1 complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned from cDNA by PCR and inserted into the pCDH lentiviral vector. pLV-mCherry has been described by our laboratory before. pUltra-Smurf (blue fluorescent protein AmCyan) was obtained from Addgene (48974, Addgene). Human GREM1 lentiviral shRNAs were obtained from the Sigma MISSION shRNA library. Five shRNAs were tested, and the two most effective shRNAs TRCN0000063833 (sh#1) and TRCN0000063837 (sh#2) were used.Lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting cDNA expression plasmids or shRNAs with helper plasmids pCMV-VSVG, pMDLg-RRE (gag/pol), and pRSV-REV into HEK293T cells using polyethyleneimine (PEI). Cell supernatants were harvested 48\u2009h after transfection and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C. MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were labeled with mCherry by infecting for 24\u2009h with mCherry-expressing lentiviral supernatants diluted 1:1 with normal culture medium in the presence of 5\u2009ng/ml of polybrene (107689, Sigma-Aldrich). Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were placed under neomycin (A1720, Sigma-Aldrich) selection. 19TT and W21 cells were labeled with AmCyan and subjected to positive fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACs). To obtain GREM1 stable expressing cell lines, M1, M2, MDA-MB-231, and W21 cells were infected and selected with puromycin (P9620, Sigma-Aldrich). Puromycin was used at 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml to maintain selection pressure. After infection with GREM1 targeting shRNAs, 19TT cells were used within short term as 19TT cells are puromycin resistant already.Stimulation with conditioned medium (CM) or cytokinesMDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were grown to 70\u201380% confluency, washed two times with PBS, and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24\u2009h. Conditioned medium (CM) was then collected and passed through a 0.45-mm syringe filter (SLHP033RB, Merck Millipore).19TT cells were treated with CM, recombinant human TGF\u03b23 (5\u2009ng/ml, 8420-B3, R&D SYSTEMS and Andrew P. Hinck, University of Pittsburg, USA), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2, 10\u2009ng/ml, 201-LB, R&D SYSTEMS), or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1, 10\u2009ng/ml, 210-TA, R&D SYSTEMS) for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24\u2009h. Buffer-treated controls were used in parallel. For antibody neutralization assays, TGF\u03b23 or CM was incubated with control (13C4) or TGF\u03b2-neutralizing (1D11) antibody (generously provided by Sanofi Genzyme, Inc.) for 30\u2009min (min) before treatment.For inhibition of BMP signaling by recombinant human Grem1 (rhGrem1, 5190-GR, R&D SYSTEMS), rhGrem1 was pre-incubated with recombinant human BMP2/6 (5\u2009ng/ml, 355-BM/507-BP, R&D SYSTEMS) for 30\u2009min.Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNAs were isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (740955, BIOKE\u00b4). A total of 1\u2009\u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1621, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Real-time PCR was conducted with GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (A6001, Promega) using CFX Connect Detection System (1855201, Bio-Rad). All target gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH. The sequences of primers used to detect target human genes in qRT-PCR were listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01 Table S1.CAGA-luciferase reporter assayHEK293T cells were seeded on a 24-well plate at approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells per well. The next day, cells in each well were co-transfected with 0.1\u2009\u03bcg TGF\u03b2/SMAD-inducible (CAGA)12 luciferase transcriptional reporter construct and 0.08\u2009\u03bcg \u03b2-galactosidase expression construct using PEI. After overnight incubation, cells were starved with serum-free medium. Eight hours later, serum-free media were removed and replaced by CM from breast cancer cell lines. One nanogram per milliliter TGF\u03b23 treatment was performed as a standard. After another overnight incubation, luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase activities were measured. The luciferase activity was normalized based on the \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Western blottingCells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009complete protease inhibitor cocktail (11836153001, Roche). Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (5000111, Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto 45-\u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (IPVH00010, Merck Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (655204, Merck Millipore) and probed with the respective primary and secondary antibodies. The signal was detected using Clarity\u2122 Western ECL Substrate (1705060, Bio-Rad) and ChemiDoc Imaging System (17001402, Bio-Rad). The antibodies used for immunoblotting were raised against the following proteins: phospho-SMAD1/5/8 (pSMAD1/5/8, home-made), \u03b1SMA (A2547, Sigma-Aldrich), fibronectin (F7387, Sigma-Aldrich), FAP (WH0002191M1, Sigma-Aldrich), collagen I (ab34710, Abcam), vimentin (5741, Cell signaling), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, MAB374, Merck Millipore). GAPDH was used as a protein loading control.Flow cytometryAdherent cells were trypsinized and washed twice with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (A2058, Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD44 (347943, BD Biosciences) and R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human CD24 (555428, BD Biosciences) antibodies (1:400 dilution) for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C in the dark. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PE-conjugated IgG isotypes (560952/560951, BD Biosciences) were used as a control. Cells were washed twice with 1% BSA in PBS and resuspended in 500\u2009ml of PBS prior to analysis on a FACS Canto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Phalloidin stainingCells were fixed in 4% formalin, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% BSA (A2058, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 30\u2009min. Then cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (A12379, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to visualize filamentous (F)-actin. The nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-fenylindool (DAPI, 62248, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were taken by confocal microscopy (SP8, Leica Microsystems).Mammosphere formation assaysSingle-cell suspensions of M1 cells were prepared in DMEM/F12 medium containing 1\u00d7 B27 (17504044, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 20\u2009ng/ml epidermal growth factor (01-107, Merck Millipore), 20\u2009ng/ml fibroblast growth factors (PHG6015, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 4\u2009mg/ml heparin (H3149, Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 2000 cells/well were seeded into ultralow attachment 24-well plate (CLS3473-24EA, Corning). After 10\u2009days of standard incubation, the numbers of spheres (>\u200975\u2009mm diameter) were counted using an inverted microscope (DMi8, Leica Microsystems). For secondary sphere formation, primary spheres were dissociated with Accutase (A1110501, Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by 25-gauge needles (Z192406, BD Biosciences) mechanically. Next, 2000 cells/well were replated. Sphere-forming efficiency was calculated as the number of spheres (average diameter\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u03bcm) formed divided by the number of single cells originally seeded.Collagen gel contraction assaysThe contraction assay was performed to evaluate the contractility of 19TT cells with GREM1 knockdown or GREM1-overexpressing W21 cells. Collagen gels were prepared by mixing fibroblast cell suspensions in serum-free medium and type I collagen (Corning, 354249) solution. The final cell density was 2.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml with 1\u2009mg/ml collagen. A 0.5-ml mixture was casted into each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to polymerize for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Following gelatinization, another 0.5\u2009ml of serum-free DMEM was added to the gel. Changes of gels were recorded by using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (17001402, Bio-Rad) at a fixed distance above the gels at 24, 48, and 72\u2009h. The surface area of the gels was quantified by ImageJ software. The percentage of contraction was calculated using the formula 100%\u2009\u00d7\u2009(well surface area\u2009\u2212\u2009gel surface area)/well surface area.Three-dimensional spheroid invasion assaymCherry-labeled MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells and co-culture (1:1 mixture) with W21 or 19TT groups were prepared at 1000 cells/ml in complete DMEM. Drops of the single-cell suspension (30\u2009\u03bcl) were placed onto the lids of 10-cm dishes, which were inverted over dishes containing 10\u2009ml PBS. Hanging drop cultures were incubated 7\u2009days allowing sufficient sedimentation and formation of one spheroid per drop. Images were taken by an inverted fluorescent microscope (DMi8, Leica Microsystems).The 3D spheroid invasion assay was performed according to our previous study with slight modifications. Single spheroids were embedded in the center of each well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate pre-coated with 50\u2009\u03bcl of collagen mixture. Type I collagen (354249, Corning) was neutralized according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The collagen mixture was prepared by diluting neutralized collagen with serum-free medium to a final concentration of 2\u2009mg/ml. Eight spheroids generated by each experimental setting were randomly chosen for embedding. After spheroid embedding, another 50\u2009\u03bcl of collagen mixture was overlaid onto the collagen matrix in each well. The plate was incubated for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C to solidify the gels. Thereafter, 50\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium was added to each well to prevent the surface from dehydrating. Plates were placed under standard cell culture conditions. Images were taken at days 0, 2, and 4 after embedding by using inverted fluorescence microscopy (DMi8, Leica Microsystems). The invasion was quantified by measuring the area occupied by cells using ImageJ software.Embryonic zebrafish intravasation and extravasation assayZebrafish xenograft breast cancer cell experiments were performed by injecting fluorescently labeled breast cancer cells into embryos at 48\u2009h post-fertilization as described before. Briefly, approximately 400 mCherry-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the perivitelline space or the duct of Curvier (DoC) of transgenic zebrafish embryos (fli: enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)), whose vasculature is marked in green. For co-injection, mCherry-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells and AmCyan-labeled W21 or 19TT cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:1. Then, approximately 400 mixed cells were injected into the zebrafish perivitelline space. Zebrafish embryos were maintained at 34\u2009\u00b0C after injection, a compromise for both the fish and the human cell lines. Three days post-injection (dpi) into the perivitelline space, the MDA-MB-231 cells that intravasated from the cell mass toward the embryonic fish body within the head and tail regions were imaged and counted under a confocal microscope (SP5 STED, Leica Microsystems). At 5\u00a0dpi into the DoC, the number of MDA-MB-231 cells that extravasated individually from the circulation into the collagen fibers of the tail fin or the number of clusters formed by M2 cells collectively was analyzed. At least 200 zebrafish embryos were injected for each condition. After verification by microscopy, only correctly injected and viable zebrafish were used for experimental analysis. All experiments were repeated at least two times independently, and representative experiments are shown.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0. Numerical data from triplicates are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (s.d.), except for the analysis of zebrafish experiments, where a representative result is expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error (s.e.m). Experiments were analyzed with an unpaired Student\u2019s t test. P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsHigh GREM1 expression in breast tumors is associated with a poor prognosisStromal expression of GREM1 predicts poor clinical outcome in breast cancer. a Kaplan-Meier survival curve in untreated lymph node-negative breast cancer patients.

Pearson\u2019s coefficient tests were performed to assess the statistical significanceBMPs have been reported to maintain epithelial integrity and to antagonize TGF\u03b2-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), an important process for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Many soluble BMP antagonists have been described to be misexpressed and to interrupt proper BMP signaling in breast cancer. We examined the prognostic role of soluble BMP antagonists in primary breast cancer using an in-house and publicly available cohort of 867 untreated lymph node-negative breast cancer patients (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section for datasets that were used). The median follow-up time of metastasis-free survival (MFS) was 94.1\u2009months (range from 1 to 299.4\u2009months). High expression of GREM1 was found to be associated with a poor prognosis among all BMP antagonists that were examined. As shown in Fig.\u00a01a, according to the GREM1 mRNA expression level, the subjects were divided evenly into three quantiles: low, middle, and high. GREM1 expression was inversely associated with MFS in this cohort, i.e., higher expression, and poorer outcome (low vs high: HR (hazard ratio)\u2009=\u20091.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15\u20131.57, log rank P\u2009=\u20090.00018; low vs middle: HR\u2009=\u20091.41, CI 1.02\u20131.96, P\u2009=\u20090.036; middle vs high: HR\u2009=\u20091.31, CI 0.98\u20131.74, P\u2009=\u20090.065). A similar association was observed when dividing subjects into two quantiles (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1a). Furthermore, high expression of GREM1 correlated with a poor prognosis in all the breast cancer molecular subtypes examined: human EGF receptor (HER)2+, triple\u2212, estrogen receptor (ER)+, and ER\u2212 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1b-e). Therefore, GREM1 is a poor prognostic marker of metastasis-free survival in breast cancer regardless of the subtype.

To explore the source of GREM1 expression, we stained GREM1 RNA by using in situ hybridization (ISH) in a breast cancer TMA, which comprised 24 matched cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, adjacent tissue, and adjacent normal tissue. As shown in Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a01c, we identified variable amounts of GREM1 expressed in fibroblast-like cells, i.e., CAFs, whereas there were no detectable levels of GREM1 in cancer-adjacent normal tissues or adjacent cancer-free breast tissues. None of the epithelial cells of breast cancers included in this study showed GREM1-positive expression. The GREM1 expression in breast cancer tissue samples is thus mainly caused by the presence of tumor stroma. Moreover, using the in-house and publicly available primary breast cancer datasets, we observed a significant positive correlation between GREM1 and markers for CAFs and tumor matrix stiffness/desmoplasia, such as FAP, fibronectin (FN)1, fibrillin (FBN)1, collagen (COL)1A1, thrombospondin (THBS)2, and a-actin (ACTA)2 (Fig.\u00a01d, Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1f). Taken together, these results suggest that CAF-derived Grem1 might play a pivotal role in promoting breast tumor progression.

Student\u2019s t test, **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01Analysis of GREM1 in tissue sections revealed that only the CAFs in close proximity to the cancer cells (tumor-stromal interface) showed high GREM1 RNA expression (Fig.\u00a01c, bottom panel). We therefore explored the possibility that fibroblasts express GREM1 in response to factors secreted by cancer or inflammatory cells. We first collected CM from M1 immortalized normal breast cells and breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. Treatment of 19TT CAFs (Fig.\u00a02a) or W21 MSCs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S2a) with MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cell CM resulted in a significant increase in GREM1 mRNA levels. There was no effect of M1 CM on GREM1 expression. To explore the factors that are responsible for inducing GREM1 expression in CAFs, we analyzed by data mining the expression of TGFB1/2/3 and inflammatory cytokines in breast cancer cell lines as well as in breast cancer tissues. We found that TGFB1/2/3 are highly expressed in both breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL1B and TNFA, were expressed in breast cancer tissues but only at very low levels in breast cancer cell lines (Fig.\u00a02b, c). IL1B and TNFA expression in breast cancer tissues are thus likely caused by the stromal cells present in breast cancer tissue samples. Challenging 19TT CAFs (Fig.\u00a02d) or W21 MSCs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S2b) with TGF\u03b23, TNF\u03b1, and IL1\u03b2 promoted GREM1 mRNA expression. Next, we analyzed whether TGF\u03b2 is secreted by cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 and MCF7, but not M1, were found to express active TGF\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a02e). Importantly, the GREM1 expression-inducing activity of MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells could be blocked by a TGF\u03b2-neutralizing antibody (Fig.\u00a02f). Taken together, TGF\u03b2 secreted by cancer cells is the main determinant for inducing GREM1 expression by CAFs. Within the tumor-stroma niche, inflammatory cells secreting cytokines may also contribute to GREM1 expression by CAFs.

First, we confirmed that BMPs and BMP receptors are indeed expressed in breast cancer cell lines (Fig.\u00a01b, Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S3a and b). Then, mammosphere formation assay was performed to assess the effect of Grem1 on mammary stem cell activity in vitro. GREM1-overexpressing M1 cells exhibited twofold more sphere formation compared to control cells in each of two subsequent passages (Fig.\u00a03a). The administration of exogenous rhGrem1 showed a similar effect on mammosphere formation of M1 cells, whereas the administration of exogenous BMP2 mitigated sphere formation ability. The latter could be reversed by the concurrent administration of rhGrem1 (Fig.\u00a03b). The surface expression of CD44+/high CD24\u2212/low cells has been considered a stem population marker of breast cancers or cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the CD44+/high CD24\u2212/low cell subpopulation in GREM1-overexpressing M1 cells compared to the control (Fig.\u00a03c). qRT-PCR revealed that GREM1 OE (Fig.\u00a03d) or rhGrem1 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S3c) increased the expression of transcriptional regulators YAP, TAZ, SOX2, and OCT4, which have been implicated in maintaining breast cancer stemness. Moreover, M1 cells treated with rhGrem1 or the BMP type I receptor inhibitor LDN193189 also displayed more CD44+/high CD24\u2212/low cells than non-treated control cells (Fig.\u00a03e). These results suggest that Grem1 enhances the mammosphere formation of M1 cells by repressing BMP signaling.

Student\u2019s t test, *P\u2009<\u20090.05To further characterize the role of Grem1 in breast cancer, we stably expressed Grem1 in the breast cancer cell lines M2 and MDA-MB-231 with a lentiviral vector. In a way, these transfected cell lines are somewhat reminiscent to the few breast cancer cell lines that express GREM1. In these GREM1-overexpressing cell lines, BMP-induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a04a) and expression of BMP target genes ID1 and 3 (Fig.\u00a04b) were clearly inhibited. Notably, the mRNA levels of the mesenchymal markers SLUG, SNAI1, VIM, and NCAD were increased by ectopic GREM1 expression (Fig.\u00a04c, d) or exogenous rhGrem1 treatment (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S4b), suggesting that Grem1 induces a slightly more mesenchymal phenotype in these breast cancer cells. To test whether exposure to Grem1 also results in more invasive behavior, we introduced these cells into the blood circulation of embryonic zebrafish via DoC injection and examined extravasation 5\u2009days post-injection (dpi) in the avascular tail fin area. Compared to the vector control, the GREM1 overexpression group showed a higher number of extravasated M2 cell clusters (Fig.\u00a04e) or MDA-MB-231 single cells (Fig.\u00a04f). The BMP/SMAD signaling could be inhibited by exogenous administration of rhGrem1 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S4b). Next, we injected MDA-MB-231 cells suspended in PBS supplemented with or without rhGrem1 into the perivitelline space of embryonic zebrafish and examined the level of cells in circulation at 3\u00a0dpi. Exogeneous rhGrem1 increased cellular intravasation significantly, as more cells were found in the head and tail regions of zebrafish embryos (Fig.\u00a04g).

Student\u2019s t test, **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01Grem1 is associated with fibrosis. To explore the role of Grem1 in fibroblast activation, we first compared GREM1 mRNA expression levels in foreskin fibroblasts, 19TT breast cancer CAFs, and HM, W18, and W21 human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). M2, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells served as a negative control. MSCs, which are considered fibroblast precursors and can differentiate into fibroblasts, showed the lowest expression of GREM1; GREM1 expression in the foreskin fibroblasts, which represent normal fibroblasts, was significantly higher than that in MSCs, and 19TT CAFs showed the highest levels (Fig.\u00a05a), indicating that GREM1 expression increases during different stages of fibroblast activation. We next knocked down GREM1 in 19TT CAFs. As shown in Fig.\u00a05b, two shRNAs-mediated GREM1 knockdown increased the mRNA expression of both ID1 and ID3 and decreased the expression of TGF\u03b2 signaling components and their target genes (plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), fibroblast activation markers, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). GREM1 knockdown in 19TT CAFs also led to decreased protein levels of FN1, S100A4, collagen I, FAP, and \u03b1SMA (Fig.\u00a05c). This result suggests that Grem1 is a pivotal factor in fibroblast activation. To examine whether Grem1 affects the cytoskeletal changes, we stained the cells with fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin to visualize filamentous (F)-actin. Indeed, GREM1 knockdown in 19TT CAFs resulted in less prominent stress fibers and less organized bundles in the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a05d). More significantly, the ability of 19TT CAFs to contract collagen gels (a 3D model widely used for evaluating fibroblast-mediated matrix remodeling capacity) decreased significantly with GREM1 knockdown (Fig.\u00a05e). Moreover, GREM1 overexpression in W21 MSCs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S5a) induced intensive myofibroblast-like characteristics (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S5b-e). Consistent with this result, W21 MSCs treated with rhGrem1 or the selective BMP receptor kinase inhibitor LDN193189 exhibited an upregulation of genes which were inhibited by GREM1 knockdown in 19TT CAFs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S5f). Overall, these observations imply that Grem1 is closely associated with the fibrogenic phenotype of breast CAFs.Fibroblast-derived Grem1 promotes breast cancer cell invasion in a 3D spheroid modelGREM1 knockdown in 19TT breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) impairs breast cancer cell invasion in a 3D spheroid invasion model. a, b Collagen invasion assay of co-culture spheroids.

Prompted by the profibrotic role of Grem1, we further explored the roles of Grem1 in fibroblast-mediated cancer cell invasion using a 3D spheroid model. As illustrated in Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S6a, spheroids were produced from hanging drop co-cultures of mCherry-labeled breast cancer cells, MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells, and AmCyan-labeled 19TT CAFs. CAFs with or without GREM1 knockdown were mixed with these breast cancer cells at a 1:1 ratio. The various resulting spheroids were embedded in collagen gel. As shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S6b, the monocultured MCF7 spheroid showed a collective cell invasion phenotype in collagen, and in the presence of 19TT cells, the increased invasion of CAFs was measured at day 4. However, upon GREM1 depletion in the 19TT CAFs, the co-culture spheroids showed strongly reduced invasion (Fig.\u00a06a). Likewise, GREM1 knockdown in the CAFs reduced the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in MDA-MB-231 and 19TT co-culture spheroids at days 2 and 4 (Fig.\u00a06b).

Grem1 expression in fibroblasts is induced by factors (such as TGF\u03b2 from breast cancer cells or maybe other stromal cells (that produce inflammatory cytokines). Grem1 could activate fibroblasts into CAFs. CAFs might present a desmoplastic microenvironment, thereby promote cancer cell invasion. Grem1 itself could promote the stemness and invasion of breast cancer cellsNext, we examined the role of fibroblast-expressed Grem1 in breast cancer cell invasion in vivo. We injected mCherry-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells into the perivitelline space of zebrafish in the absence or presence of either AmCyan-labeled W21 MSCs, foreskin fibroblasts, or 19TT CAFs. As depicted in Fig.\u00a07a, intravasation of the MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly increased when co-implanted with W21, validating a previous study in which MSCs promoted cancer metastasis. Importantly, this intravasation was much more enhanced by the foreskin fibroblasts and even more so by the 19TT CAFs, suggesting a correlation with their GREM1 expression level. Indeed, the ectopic expression of GREM1 in W21 cells resulted in enhanced MDA-MB-231 cell intravasation upon co-injection (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Figure S7). Consistent with this result, GREM1 knockdown mitigated the promotion role of 19TT CAFs on MDA-MB-231 cell intravasation (Fig.\u00a07b). DiscussionOur work has uncovered a strong association between high GREM1 expression in breast tumor biopsies and a poor prognosis. We provide mechanistic insights into GREM1\u2019s key role in facilitating breast cancer progression using in vitro and in vivo studies. Grem1 is highly expressed by CAFs at the invasion front; its expression can be promoted by factors, such as TGF\u03b2 released by breast cancer cells and inflammatory cytokines. Grem1 mediates the fibrogenic activation of CAFs in an autocrine manner. Grem1 has a direct effect on cancer cell invasion and stemness, evidenced by the fact that it promoted a slightly more mesenchymal/stemness phenotype in breast cancer cells. It could also contribute indirectly to this process via its potent effects on fibroblast activation. In this way, Grem1 promotes the formation of a microenvironment conducive to breast cancer cell invasion. Thus, Grem1 is a key determinant of the mutual interplay between breast cancer cells and CAFs (Fig.\u00a07c).Although we found an association between Grem1 and poor breast cancer prognosis, the prognostic significance of Grem1 in different cancer types is not consistent. For example, Grem1 expression correlates with progression-free survival in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and colorectal cancer, but it is an indicator of poor progression-free survival in cervical cancer. Grem1 may have different roles in different tumor types, but this may be dependent on the experimental setup, the analysis of expression in complete tumors vs stromal expression specifically, and/or the determining the levels of RNA vs protein. For instance, when testing commercial antibodies on tissue sections, including sections of GREM1-deficient animals, we found that the detected signals may not have been specific for Grem1 (data not shown). To avoid these putatively non-specific measurements, we determined GREM1 mRNA levels by in situ hybridization.The mRNA detection method revealed that GREM1 was exclusively expressed by CAFs. Our findings are supported by our data mining of publicly available datasets. We analyzed breast cancer dataset GSE14548 generated by Ma and colleagues, which separated epithelial and stromal tissues, and in this dataset, GREM1 was found mainly expressed in the (invasive) breast cancer stroma, and there was no GREM1 expression observed in normal epithelium and stroma (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure. S8a). In addition, we mined a colon cancer dataset GSE39396 in which epithelial cells, leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells were separately isolated by FACs and thereafter profiled. Consistent with our results, only fibroblasts were found to express GREM1 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S8b).We found that GREM1 expression in CAFs is particularly high in close vicinity of cancer cells. This is consistent with previous reports in which Grem1 was found to be highly expressed in CAFs in the microenvironment of basal cell carcinoma (and other tumors) compared to normal tissue counterparts and a study of colorectal cancer, in which Grem1 was found to be expressed at the invasion fronts in CAFs and to mediate the loss of cancer cell differentiation. We identified TGF\u03b2 secreted by cancer cells as a strong driver of GREM1 expression by CAFs. Moreover, clinical breast cancer samples were also found to highly express TGFB1/2/3 suggesting that these findings are of clinical relevance. Such invasion fronts are rich in inflammatory cells. Consistent with this result, we found that inflammatory cytokines IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b2 induced GREM1 expression in CAFs. Moreover, GREM1 expression correlated with mesenchymal marker expression in tumor samples. The latter observation indicates that Grem1 at the invasion front may contribute to the desmoplastic phenotype (Fig.\u00a07).We observed a striking activation of fibrogenesis in fibroblasts and in CAFs by Grem1. Depletion or ectopic expression of Grem1 in CAFs demonstrated that Grem1 expression is positively linked to the expression of TGF\u03b2 ligands and target genes, mesenchymal markers, extracellular matrix proteins, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) remodeling factors at the mRNA level, as well as with fibronectin, S100A4, collagen I, FAP, and \u03b1SMA at the protein level. In addition, Grem1 promoted actin stress fiber formation and collagen gel contraction. These expression patterns are a characteristic of a fibrogenic response and fibroblast activation. The Grem1-induced responses may be mediated by TGF\u03b2 pathway activation; TGF\u03b2 is a strong inducer of fibrogenesis and an activator of fibroblasts. With TGF\u03b2 being a strong inducer of Grem1 and vice versa, it may act in a feed-forward loop.Multiple studies have shown that CAFs create a microenvironment suitable for cancer cell invasion, which we further demonstrated in this study in vivo by co-injection of breast cancer cells with fibroblasts/CAFs into the zebrafish perivitelline space. Thus, the profibrogenic ability of Grem1 could contribute to its role in promoting cancer cell invasion mediated by activated fibroblasts and CAFs. 3D co-culture of breast cancer cells with CAFs in collagen demonstrated that Grem1 is critical for invasion. In accordance with these results, Grem1 strongly promoted intravasation in a zebrafish co-injection xenograft model. Moreover, by injecting ectopic Grem1-producing M2 and MDA-MB-231 cells into the DoC of zebrafish embryos, we found that Grem1 strongly promoted the extravasation of cancer cells. These results may explain the clinical association between Grem1 expression in tumors and a poor prognosis of MFS.Mechanistically, Grem1 exerts its effects by antagonizing selective BMPs. Consistent with this notion, we found that BMP-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation is inhibited in breast cancer cells and in CAFs. In addition, depletion of endogenous Grem1 in CAFs upregulates BMP/SMAD-dependent ID1/ID3 expression while the addition of rhGrem1 has the opposite effect. Moreover, treatment with a selective BMP receptor kinase inhibitor mimicked the effect of exogenous Grem1 protein by promoting mammosphere formation and fibrogenic marker expression. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that Grem1 also can act via BMP-independent pathways. For example, induction of TGF\u03b2 expression by Grem1 may occur independently of BMP antagonism. Grem1 was found to promote cell viability, migration, and invasion in glioma and the invasive phenotype of mesothelioma by activating TGF\u03b2/SMAD signaling. Moreover, Grem1 may promote breast tumorigenesis by acting on signaling pathways distinct from TGF\u03b2 family signaling; in renal tubular cells, Grem1 has been reported to signal via the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway to promote angiogenesis and to mediate inflammation and the infiltration of immune-inflammatory cells. Furthermore, Grem1 may act directly or indirectly by sequestering BMP on endothelial cells and immune cells and thereby promote tumorigenesis. Irrespective of the precise mechanisms, our results demonstrate potent pro-tumorigenic effects of Grem1 on cancer cells and CAFs in vitro in mono- and in co-culture, as well as a key in vivo role for Grem1 in stimulating extravasation and for Grem1-producing CAFs in mediating the intravasation of breast cancer cells. These two processes, extravasation and intravasation, are the key steps in the dissemination and distant colonization of primary cancer cells.ConclusionOur results identified Grem1 as a driving force of breast cancer progression by affecting the behavior of both cancer cells and neighboring CAFs. Antibodies that neutralize Grem1\u2019s function in the Grem1-BMP interaction have been described, which may be beneficial not only for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension but also for breast cancer (by inhibiting breast cancer progression). In addition, BMP agonists that are engineered to prevent interactions with Grem1, as has been performed for Noggin, or BMP-mimetic small-molecule drugs, could be beneficial in the treatment of breast cancer patients with high Grem1 expression.Additional filesAbbreviationsACTA\u03b2-Actin\u03b1SMA\u03b1-Smooth muscle actinBMPsBone morphogenetic proteinsBSABovine serum albuminCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCMConditional medium3DThree-dimensionalcDNAComplementary DNACOLCollagenDCISDuctal carcinoma in situDoCDuct of CurvierDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumdpiDays post-injectionECMExtracellular matrixEGFPEnhanced green fluorescent proteinEMTEpithelial to mesenchymal transitionEREstrogen receptorFACsFluorescence-activated cell sortingFAPFibroblast activation proteinFBSFetal bovine serumFNFibronectinFSP1Fibroblast-specific protein 1fRMAFrozen robust multiarray analysisGAPDHGlyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHERHuman epidermal growth factor receptorHRHazard rationID1Inhibitor DNNA bindingIL1\u03b2Interleukin 1\u03b2ISHIn situ hybridizationGrem1Gremlin 1M1MCF10AM2MCF10A-RasMEMMinimum Essential MediumMMPMatrix metalloproteinaseMSCMesenchymal stem cellsMFSMetastasis-free survivalPEIPolyethyleniminePen/StrepPenicillin/streptomycinrhRecombinant humans.d.Standard deviations.e.m.Standard errorSNPSingle nucleotide polymorphismTGF\u03b2Transforming growth factor \u03b2TNF\u03b1Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1TMATissue microarrayTHBSThrombospondinqRT-PCRQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsPtD, JWMM, and JR were responsible for the conceptualization and acquisition of the data.

Although there are initial responses to treatment, many cancers relapse and distant metastases occur in nearly one-third of woman; these are typically fatal. The biology behind BC metastases still remains undetermined. Therefore, understanding molecular determinants of metastasis is crucial for finding new therapeutic strategies. The tumour microenvironment consists of immune cells, blood vessels, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. This microenvironment plays key roles in disease outcome by inducing tumour cell proliferation and aggressiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an activated form of tissue-resident fibroblasts present within breast cancers, comprise a major component of the tumour microenvironment, characterised most commonly by expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. CAFs can induce cancer progression and metastasis by secreting various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (e.g., VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12, IL6 and IL8) and by modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) that facilitates tumour cell migration and invasion. CAFs also modulate immune cell function to create an immune-suppressive environment during cancer progression. The process of transformation of CAFs from resident normal fibroblasts is achieved by several growth factors, however, the mechanisms of transformation have not yet been fully explored and may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention; interestingly, once transformed into CAFs, the CAF phenotype has been regarded as stable, probably though maintenance of epigenetic changes.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3\u2032untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target genes, leading to post-transcriptional downregulation. MiRNAs can be oncogenic or act as tumour suppressors, depending upon the specific genes that they regulate. Dysregulation of miRNAs within the fibroblast component of breast cancer has been reported, and is therefore implicated in induction or maintenance of the CAF phenotype. For example, differential expression between breast CAFs and normal fibroblasts has been reported for many miRNAs, including miR-221, miR-31, miR-205, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-107, miR-30b, the let-7 family and miR-26b, although there is relatively little consistency between reports. Far fewer miRNAs have been shown experimentally to have functional impacts on the breast CAF phenotype, or most interestingly indirectly on cancer cell behaviour; examples include miR-26b, let-7b, miR-200 family and miR-29b. Although some of these studies have indicated functional roles for specific miRNAs within CAFs, very few studies have directly investigated miRNA roles on the transformation and maintenance of CAF phenotypes and on how this impacts on cancer behaviour, therefore how miRNAs in CAFs are involved in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we have focussed on miR-222 as a candidate regulator of CAF phenotypes and cancer behaviour. MiR-222 has previously been reported as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including BC, functioning within the cancer cells themselves, as opposed to stromal cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that upregulation of miR-222 induced growth of cancer cells by targeting p27/kip1, as well as chemoresistance by targeting PTEN/Akt. Interestingly, in the context of our study on function in fibroblasts, levels of miR-222 positively correlated with fibroblast viability in hypertrophic scar tissues, while miR-222 has been shown to induce replicative senescence in human lung fibroblasts. However, to date, no studies have been published on roles of miR-222 in CAFs. Therefore, the above observations suggest the importance of miR-222 as a post-transcriptional modifier, playing functional roles in BC progression. However, it is unclear whether expression of miR-222 is only tumour cell specific or the other cells also express miR-222 in tumour microenvironment. As miR-222 is an important oncogenic factor in breast cancer, we wanted to unveil whether CAFs also expressed miR-222 to influence disease progression.Materials and methodsReagentsFoetal bovine serum (FBS), DMEM and antibiotic/antimycotic (100X; 10,000\u2009units/mL penicillin, 10,000\u2009\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 25\u2009\u00b5g/mL amphotericin B) were purchased from ThermoFisher (MA, USA).

KpnI, XbaI, PmeI, NotI and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (MA, USA).Ethical issues and cell cultureEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East REC (references 06/Q1206/180, 09/H1306/108), and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015. Fresh samples of surgically removed breast cancer samples were minced, digested with collagenase IV from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai, India) and plated (collagenase I coated) to derive primary breast CAFs (from within tumour masses) and NFs (from\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm outside tumour margins). Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were obtained from the ATCC (VA, USA). The NF and CAF fibroblast lines were derived from breast cancer samples and immortalised using lentiviral transduction of hTERT, as previously described. All cell lines were cultured in the DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics in a humid atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. NFs were transfected with scrambled siRNA negative control (NC), siLBR, miR-222 mimic or mimic control using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher; MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Similarly, CAFs were transfected with scramble negative control, miR-222 inhibitor, pCDNA or pCDNA-LBR. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting, qRT-PCR analyses, senescence studies or migration/invasion studies. To collect NF and CAF conditioned medium, cells were seeded into six-well plates at 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well. As previously described, cells were transfected as appropriate for 24\u2009h, then medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. After 48 and 72\u2009h of incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 150\u2009g for 5\u2009min, and then the supernatant was collected.RNA isolation and qPCRMiR-222 is upregulated in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and controls breast fibroblast phenotype. a MiR-222 expression was determined by qPCR, and is shown for CAFs relative to NFs in three separate cell types.

The data represent technical triplicates. Middle plot: four matched pairs of primary cultured CAFs and NFs from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. The data represent technical triplicates. Right plot: immortalised breast CAF and NF cell lines. The data represent biological triplicates. b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and miR-222 expression was assessed using qPCR. Data represent biological triplicates. c Relative gene expression levels of the CAF markers, \u03b1-SMA, Fibroblast Specific Protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were assessed in immortalised CAFs as compared with immortalised NFs using qPCR. The data represent biological triplicates. d Relative expression levels of the same CAF markers were assessed using qPCR in NFs (left) or CAFs (right) transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC). The data represent biological triplicates. e NFs or CAFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and protein expression of the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA (ACTA2) and vimentin were assessed using Western blots, along with \u03b2-actin as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005For LMD samples, the total RNA was extracted from using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, or the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). RNA was reverse-transcribed for miR-222 using the TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and the resulting first strand was amplified using specific Taqman miRNA assay primers (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). The PCRs were performed by StepOne plus detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and amplification data were normalised using RNU6 expression. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. For cultured primary fibroblasts (in Fig.\u00a01b), RNA was isolated from a 90-mm dish of cultured cells using TRIzol (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction and RNA quantified by MULTISCANGO (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). For miRNA expression status and gene expression status, first strand cDNA and cDNA were synthesised with miScript RT-II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Superscript III (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), respectively. MiR-222 expression was analysed using PCR starter kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); U6 was used as an endogenous control. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) on StepOne detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Expression was normalised to the house-keeping gene 18S.Protein extraction and western blotsCells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer System (lysis buffer pH 7.4, 200\u2009mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail,\u00a0100\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate) (Santa Cruz-sc24948). The lysates were centrifuged at 12700\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u02daC. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) then transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk. The membrane was then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India). Bands were visualised using ECL.Histology, laser capture microdissection (LMD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)LMD was carried out on the Zeiss PALM Laser Capture Microdissection Microscope exactly as described previously. In brief, archival FFPE cancer blocks and matched normal blocks were obtained and sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm onto Membrane Slides NF 1.0 PEN (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A guide section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a histopathologist (LMW) to identify areas of fibroblasts with very few admixed inflammatory cells, epithelial cells or necrosis. The equivalent areas were then identified on other sections, and these were collected with the laser into lids of AdhesiveCap500 opaque PCR Tubes (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by laser pressure catapulting (LPC). The microscope settings used for LCM were cut energy 71, focus 65, LPC energy 100, focus 65 at \u00d7100 magnification. Areas dissected from each case varied between 5.2 and 27.4\u00d7106\u2009\u03bcm2 depending on fibroblast density. For IHC, FFPE human breast cancer resection tissue was available; cancerous and non-cancerous breast tissue were immunostained for \u03b1-SMA and LBR. The signal was amplified and visualised with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen, followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin.Luciferase reporter assaysLamin B Receptor (LBR) is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts and is downregulated in breast CAFs relative to matched NFs. a LBR was identified as a potential miR-222 target by bioinformatics. The potential miR-222-binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is shown (WT), along with a binding-dead mutant used experimentally (MUT). b Luciferase reporters were cloned that allow expression of luciferase transcripts containing the wild-type or mutant LBR miR-222 3\u2032UTR binding sites. These were transfected into NFs (left) or CAFs (right) along with either miR-222 mimic or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC), and relative luciferase activity was determined. The data represent two biological replicates. c, d NFs or CAFs were transfected as shown, and the relative expression of endogenous LBR was determined using qPCR (c) or western blots (d). qPCR data represent three biological replicates. e Representative matched pair of normal and breast cancer tissues was assessed for expression of LBR by immunohistochemistry (\u00d710 and \u00d720 magnification). Brown staining represents expression of the target protein, while pink is a counterstain. f Relative expression of LBR was assessed in eight pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour. The data represent technical triplicates. g Protein expression levels of LBR, and the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA and vimentin were assessed by western blotting in three pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05The potential miR-222 binding sequence from the LBR gene (WT LBR) and three nucleotide-mutated LBR (MUT LBR) (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned into pMiRGLO (Promega, WI, USA) under restriction sites PmeI and XbaI (primers listed in Table\u00a0S1). Luciferase activities were measured 48\u2009h after transfection using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays (Promega, WI, USA).Cell proliferation assaysNFs and CAFs were seeded in 96-well plates at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well and transfected the following day. Cell proliferation was monitored after 72\u2009h by MTT (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). In total, 10\u2009\u00b5l of MTT solution (10\u2009mg/ml) in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMEM media was added per well. After 4\u2009h of incubation, formazan complexes were dissolved in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMSO, and signals were measured using MULTISCANGO plate reader (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). To evaluate the effects of conditioned media, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were seeded in 96-well plates at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, condition media was applied. MTT assays were performed at 48\u2009h as above.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion ability were determined by Corning transwell insert chambers (8-\u00b5m pores; Corning, MA, USA) and Matrigel (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) coated in a transwell chamber for invasion analysis. Conditional media from different treatment conditions were used in lower chambers for migration and invasion study. The cells were prior treated with conditional media for 48\u2009h. In total, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 were added into chambers and incubated for 28\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells that had migrated or invaded were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, imaged and counted manually.Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) assaysSA-\u03b2-gal activity was detected by \u03b2-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing blue stain were counted manually as positive senescent cells, and images were taken under phase contrast.Cell immunostaining and confocal microscopyNFs and CAFs were allowed to attach to glass coverslips overnight at 37\u2009\u02daC. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20\u2009min) and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 (15\u2009min). Blocking was performed with 5% BSA for 1\u2009h followed by incubation with \u03b1-SMA and vimentin primary antibodies (4\u2009\u02daC overnight). AlexaFluor 488-conjugated and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1\u2009h. Coverslips were counterstained with DAPI and analysed on a confocal microscope (Olympus).CloningFor the LBR-overexpressing vector, LBR open-reading frame was cloned within pCDNA 3.1+ vector using KpnI and XbaI restriction sites and primers GTGGTACCACCATGCCAAGTAGGAAATTTG (forward) and GCTCTAGAGCTTAGTAGATGTATGGAAATATACGG (reverse).Statistical analysesAll data are representative of at least three independent experiments.

To investigate roles of miR-222 dysregulation in CAF biology, we first assessed relative expression of miR-222 in 14 matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that have been isolated from breast cancer resection samples using laser microdissection (LMD). We found miR-222 to be upregulated in CAFs relative to matched NFs in 11 out of 14 cases, representing significant upregulation overall by a mean fold of 3.63 (p\u2009<\u20090.04; Fig.\u00a01a, left plot). To expand this finding, we further assessed miR-222 expression in four matched pairs of primary human breast NFs and CAFs cultures extracted from breast cancer resections; we found a greater than twofold induction of miR-222 in CAFs as compared with matched NFs in all cases (Fig.\u00a01a, middle plot). Finally, miR-222 expression in immortalised human breast NFs was compared with immortalised human breast CAFs; this also showed higher expression of miR-222 in CAFs by more than threefold (Fig.\u00a01a, right plot). We concluded that miR-222 is more highly expressed in CAFs than NFs in breast tissue.To explore functional roles of miR-222 in transformation of NFs to CAFs, we conducted a series of experiments on immortalised human breast NFs or immortalised human breast CAFs using miR-222 mimics to upregulate expression in NFs, or miR-222 inhibitors to downregulate expression in CAFs. First, miR-222 expression was assessed using qRT-PCR to confirm appropriate over- or under-expression (Fig.\u00a01b); miR-222 was significantly overexpressed by more than eightfold and was knocked down to one-third of its original level. Next, the relatively \u201cnormal\u201d or CAF-like phenotypes of these cell lines were characterised to establish their baselines for subsequent analyses. Expression of a range of classical CAF markers was assessed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a01c), immunofluorescence or western blotting (Fig.\u00a0S1). Relative expressions of ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin), FSP, CCL2 and VEGF were all substantially higher in CAFs as compared with NFs (a minimum of fivefold higher as assessed by qRT-PCR), as indicative of the CAF phenotype. Upregulation in CAFs of ACTA2/smooth muscle actin and vimentin was also confirmed at the protein level (Fig.\u00a0S1). Next, NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control mimics, and CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or control inhibitors, and miR-222\u2032s influence on transformation of NFs to CAFs, or on maintenance of the CAF phenotype was examined using the same panel of CAF markers as previously. Transfection of miR-222 mimics in NFs resulted in significant upregulation of all the CAF markers (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, left plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). Furthermore, downregulation of miR-222 in CAFs using miR-222 inhibitors significantly downregulated expression of the CAF markers, with the notable and surprising exception of CCL2 (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, right plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). We concluded that miR-222 levels play key roles in controlling the CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.LBR is a direct target of miR-222To investigate potential mechanisms by which miR-222 plays roles in breast fibroblast biology, bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential target genes of miR-222. We analysed the best possible miR-222 seed matches using miRanda, TargetScan and miRDB software. Eleven predicted target genes were chosen for further analysis based on the target scores, containing seed matches for miR-222. On analysis of expression by qRT-PCR in NFs and paired CAFs from patient samples three of these genes, RECK, THOP1 and LBR, demonstrated differential expression in the predicted direction. LBR showed the most substantial and consistent dysregulated result in NFs and CAFs, and therefore LBR was prioritised for subsequent analyses. The potential miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is depicted in Fig.\u00a02a. We performed a number of different assays to assess whether LBR is a true direct target of miR-222 within breast fibroblasts. First, luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type miR-222 binding site from the LBR 3\u2032UTR or a mutated (non-binding) version of the site (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned. Reporters were co-transfected with miR-222 mimics and inhibitors, or appropriate controls, in NFs and CAFs respectively, and luciferase assays were performed. MiR-222 mimics significantly inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter containing the wild-type LBR site, while the mutated site was insensitive to miR-222 overexpression in NFs (Fig.\u00a02b, left plot), whereas miR-222 inhibitors significantly increased the activity of the wild-type reporter, while the mutated reporter was again insensitive in CAFs (Fig.\u00a02b, right plot). Next, endogenous LBR expression was assessed in NFs after transfection to overexpress miR-222, and in CAFs after transfection with miR-222 inhibitors (Fig.\u00a02c, d). LBR expression was downregulated by miR-222 overexpression and upregulated by miR-222 inhibition at the level of both transcript (Fig.\u00a02c) and protein (Fig.\u00a02d), findings that were in accordance with it being downstream of miR-222 function. We concluded that LBR is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts, via a canonical miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR.Downregulation of LBR induces a CAF-like phenotypeOur next aim was to determine whether LBR downregulation is involved in determining the breast CAF phenotype, since we have already determined that CAFs overexpress miR-222 and that this can downregulate LBR. In one approach, we examined whether breast normal stroma or tumour stroma exhibit differential expression of LBR using immunohistochemistry. LBR expression (Fig.\u00a02e) was relatively reduced in tumour stroma, in contrast to ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin) (Fig.\u00a0S2), which was relatively high in tumour stroma. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed on eight matched pairs of primary NF and CAF cultures. LBR expression was significantly reduced by a mean of 4.3-fold in CAFs compared with the NFs (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in contrast to expression of the CAF markers ACTA2 and vimentin, which were upregulated in CAFs as expected and indicative of the CAF phenotype (Fig.\u00a02f, g).LBR regulates the NF vs CAF breast fibroblast phenotype. a, b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or control (NC), or plasmid to allow overexpression of LBR (LBR OE) or control plasmid (pCDNA), and LBR expression was assessed using qPCR (a) or western blots (b). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. c\u2013e Immortalised breast NFs (c, e) or CAFs (d, e) were transfected as shown, and the relative expression levels of the CAF marker genes \u03b1-SMA, fibroblast-specific protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were determined by qPCR (c, d), or of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin by western blot (e). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005We next assessed whether LBR downregulation was sufficient for transformation of NFs to CAFs, and conversely whether LBR overexpression would reduce CAF features. We transfected immortalised breast NFs with siRNA targeted against LBR or with an appropriate non-targeting control, and also transfected immortalised breast CAFs with plasmids to allow overexpression of LBR, or with appropriate control plasmids. The efficacy of knockdown and overexpression was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a) and western blots (Fig.\u00a03b); knockdown was to ~30% of the original levels, while overexpression was by more than ninefold. Next, we assessed expression of our panel of CAF markers in these cells after knockdown or overexpression of LBR using qRT-PCR or western blots as previously. Reduction of LBR expression in NFs, and increased expression of LBR in CAFs, significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the expression of all the CAF markers (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). We concluded that LBR is a key regulator of the breast CAF phenotype, and that knockdown of LBR alone is sufficient to transform NFs into cells that resemble CAFs.MiR-222 and LBR regulate migration, invasion and senescence in breast fibroblastsMiR-222 and its downstream target LBR modulate the behaviour of breast fibroblasts. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). a, b Migration (a) or invasion (b) of fibroblasts was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (a, b, upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (a, b, lower panels). c Expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase was also assessed by X-gal staining and is shown as blue green colouration (upper panels). Positive cells were quantified in data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). d Expression of the senescence markers MMP3 and osteopontin (OPN) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers IL6 and IL8 were assessed by qPCR in NFs (left plot) and CAFs (right plot). The data represent biological triplicates. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Since it has been previously demonstrated that CAFs are characterised by higher cell motility than their adjacent NFs, we also investigated whether miR-222 overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of LBR would induce increased NF migration or invasion, and conversely whether miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression would reduce CAF migration or invasion. Immortalised breast NFs or CAFs were transfected as previously with miR-222 mimics or inhibitors, respectively, or with siRNA targeted against LBR or overexpression of LBR, respectively. We then performed migration or invasion assays using transwell assays. NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siRNA targeting LBR had significantly higher migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, left plots), whereas inhibition of miR-222 or LBR overexpression in CAFs significantly reduced their migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, right plots). In order to confirm that these apparent effects on migration and invasion did not relate to differences in cell numbers induced by the transfections, we also evaluated proliferation capabilities of fibroblasts after these manipulations of miR-222 or LBR expression. We performed MTT assays after the same transfected conditions as mentioned above; there were no significant differences in proliferation of NFs or CAFs after any of these treatments (Fig.\u00a0S3). We concluded that miR-222 and its target LBR have key influences on aspects of CAF-like fibroblast behaviour, namely migration and invasion.It was previously reported that loss of LBR is associated with induction of cellular senescence, therefore, we also specifically evaluated senescence by determining senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activities in NFs and CAFs after dysregulation of expression of miR-222 or LBR. We found an increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siLBR compared to controls (Fig.\u00a04c, left plot). In addition, inhibition of miR-222 activity or increased LBR expression in CAFs significantly reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right plot). We also further examined features of this senescence phenotype by determining whether it was also associated with differential expression of other senescence markers. NFs and CAFs were transfected as before, and qRT-PCR was used to assess expression of MMP3, OPN, IL6 and IL8, which are upregulated in senescent cells particularly those showing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Expression of all four markers was significantly upregulated in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimic or siLBR (Fig.\u00a04d, left plot), while expression was significantly downregulated in CAFs transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or to overexpress LBR (Fig.\u00a04d, right plot). This provided strong support that changes in \u03b2-gal activity we had detected were indeed associated with senescence, and that miR-222 and LBR expression impact on senescence phenotypes in breast fibroblasts.miR-222 and LBR in breast fibroblasts regulate proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cellsMiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to influence cancer cell proliferation and metastatic potential. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. a, b Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled was determined using MTT assay. The data represent biological triplicates. c\u2013f Migration (c, e) or invasion (d, f) of epithelial cancer cells was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05To better understand the exact effects of miR-222 and its action on LBR in fibroblasts on epithelial breast cancer cell behaviour, we assessed abilities of NFs and CAFs after manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression to induce growth or migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. In particular, we focused on the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and the relatively less metastatic and triple-negative MDA-MB-157 cell lines. In order to assess influences of fibroblasts on the cancer cells, we decided to collect conditioned medium from fibroblasts and treat cancer cells with this. Fibroblast-conditioned medium has frequently been shown to influence cancer cell behaviour in this context. NFs or CAFs were transfected exactly as previously. Conditional medium (CM) was collected from these cells after transfection, and was added to cultures of epithelial breast cancer cells. First, proliferation of epithelial cells was assessed using MTT assays after treatment with CM (Fig.\u00a05a, b). In both epithelial cell lines, CM from control NFs caused a marginal, but not significant, reduction in proliferation, while CM from control CAFs caused a marked and significant increase in proliferation when compared with cells without CM (p\u2009<\u20090.005), as has been reported previously. More interestingly, overexpression of miR-222 in NFs and knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs significantly altered the activity of these CMs on both epithelial cell lines; miR-222 overexpression in NFs produced CM that had similar growth inducing effects to that from control CAFs, while knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs reduced this growth stimulation (Fig.\u00a05a). Changes in LBR expression within NFs and CAFs also had similar significant effects, with LBR knockdown allowing CM from NFs to induce relative growth increases, while overexpression of LBR in CAFs reduced the growth stimulatory effect of CAF CM (Fig.\u00a05b). We concluded that upregulation of miR-222 and downregulation of LBR were both necessary and sufficient for CAF function with respect to inducing proliferation of breast cancer cells. Next, we investigated the influences of these CMs on the motility of BC cells. BC cells also responded dramatically and significantly to these CMs in terms of migration and invasion capacities. CM from NFs had little influence on migration, while CM from CAFs significant and consistently induced migration (Fig.\u00a05c, e) and invasion (Fig.\u00a05d, f) in both epithelial cell lines. Overexpression of miR-222 or knockdown of LBR in NFs led to enhanced migration in the epithelial lines. Knockdown of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs led to reduced migration in the epithelial lines. Exactly the same result was evident in terms of invasion, with miR-222 and LBR having a key influence on abilities of NFs or CAFs to induce invasion in both epithelial cell lines (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f). To further clarify that differences in migration/invasion of the breast cancer epithelial cells treated with CM did not solely relate to changes in proliferation rate, we additionally performed an experiment assessing proliferation in the cells treated exactly as for the migration/invasion assay (Fig.\u00a0S4), which involves an earlier time point than that used for Fig.\u00a05a, b. There were no significant differences in almost all combinations, supporting the conclusion that true differences in migration/invasion were seen. An exception is MDA-MB-157 cells treated with CAF CM, in which a significant reduction in proliferation was seen with CM after miR-222 knockdown and LBR overexpression; however, this change in proliferation was only up to 20% (Fig.\u00a0S4), whereas decreases in migration/invasion were up to 50% (Fig.\u00a05e, f), indicating that\u2014again\u2014true influences on migration/invasion were seen.MiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to activate EMT in breast cancer cells. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. Expression levels of the EMT-associated genes slug and vimentin were assessed in MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled using qPCR (a, c) or western blots (b, d). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Finally, to determine whether the fibroblasts were influencing migration and invasion capacity of epithelial cells by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, we analysed expression of EMT markers slug and vimentin in the BC cells after culture with the same CMs, using both qRT-PCR and western blots (Fig.\u00a06). CM from NFs had little influence on slug or vimentin expression at either transcript or protein level, while CM from CAFs induced up to a sixfold increase in expression. Manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression in the fibroblasts consistently and significantly altered slug and vimentin expression in accordance with the changes in migration and invasion, with greater slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade more by miR-222 mimics or LBR siRNA in NFs, and reduced slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade less by miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression in CAFs. We concluded that miR-222 and, downstream of this, LBR have key influences on abilities of breast fibroblasts to control critical cancer-related behaviours of breast epithelial cancer cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT.DiscussionIncreasing evidence supports the proposal that miRNA dysregulation within CAFs modulates function of the tumour microenvironment. However, it is worth highlighting that most studies have emphasised investigation of miRNA roles within the tumour cells themselves, therefore it remains the case that relatively little is known about roles of miRNAs in the tumour microenvironment. In this study, we have focussed on roles of miR-222 within fibroblasts.We initially compared the miR-222 expression difference between CAFs and adjacent NFs in breast cancer tissue samples. Our study demonstrated that miR-222 was significantly upregulated in CAFs. Although others have made similar comparisons for multiple miRNAs in this context, miR-222 has not previously been identified as differentially expressed. This may be because studies have not always effectively purified only the fibroblasts for their analyses, as we have by LMD, or may be because miR-222 was not always included in the analyses. Next, we identified that miR-222 targets Lamin B receptor (LBR) expression in the CAFs. Various targets of miR-222 have been published previously, but LBR is a novel target on which we focused since we were able to confirm its downregulation in CAFs in accordance with negative regulation by the upregulated miR-222. Most importantly, downregulation of LBR with siRNA phenocopied miR-222 overexpression in functional experiments using breast fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that LBR is a key functionally important target of miR-222 in these cells.In terms of cellular function, we showed that miR-222 and LBR were both involved in defining and maintaining the breast CAF phenotype in terms of expression patterns, and fibroblast behaviours including migration and invasion. MiR-222 has previously been assigned roles in promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and drug resistance within cancer cells, so our findings are in accordance with this, although they represent the first observations to our knowledge in a cancer stromal cell type. With respect to functions of LBR, a role in senescence has previously been reported in fibroblasts and we also observed a related result with manipulation of LBR expression by siRNA, overexpression or via miR-222 all impacting on senescence in breast fibroblasts. LBR encodes the lamin B receptor, a 70.4-kD protein of the inner nuclear membrane, which is known to interact with heterochromatin and B-type lamins. Other functions for the protein have been implied by observations that ectopic LBR expression deregulates differentiation of olfactory neurons inducing an un- or early-differentiated state.More excitingly, we showed that fibroblasts with differential expression of miR-222 or LBR have potent differential influences on behaviour of two independent breast epithelial cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that conditioned medium from fibroblasts that were stimulated to be more CAF-like by miR-222 overexpression or siLBR promoted breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Similarly, abilities of conditioned medium from CAFs to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion was inhibited by reduced miR-222 levels or by LBR overexpression. Next, we investigated possible pathways involved in the breast tumour motility effects. We found that the enhanced migration and invasion were associated with increased expression of vimentin and slug in the BC cells, suggesting involvement of the EMT pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-222 upregulation, and subsequent LBR downregulation, within fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment contribute to progression of BC, through induction of proliferation and EMT-related motility. It is established that cancer progression is not only dependent on tumour cells themselves but also dependent on the tumour microenvironment and, in particular, CAFs, which promote growth and invasion of cancer cells through synthesis and remodelling of ECM and secreting some growth factors. Hence, blocking CAF activity may be a key approach to effectively control cancer metastasis. Manipulation of either miR-222 expression or LBR function provide candidate approaches for development of these types of anti-cancer therapies. In particular, our data demonstrate that reduced expression of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs greatly reduces their ability to promote aggressive behaviours in cancer cells, supporting the proposal that CAF phenotypes are not fixed and could be normalised therapeutically.Surprisingly, our data also implicate the miR-222/LBR axis in senescence induction in CAFs. Previous studies have indicated that increased miR-222 or loss of LBR induces senescence, so this is not a surprise in itself; however, it is unexpected that high levels of senescence in CAFs would be associated with cancer cell behaviours that promote progression, since senescence is often regarded as a tumour-suppressor mechanism in cancer cells. However, more recent evidence shows that senescent cells may promote oncogenesis through secretion of secretory factors (SASP) and several reports describe abilities of senescent human fibroblasts to promote growth and tumorigenesis. In support of this, here, we demonstrated that miR-222 overexpression in NFs induces a SASP phenotype, leading to increased secretion of at least the SASP factors IL6 and IL8, and the classical senescence marker MMP3.In conclusion, we present miR-222 and LBR as key molecules involved in transformation and maintenance of breast CAFs, which in turn therefore impacts on the aggressive tumorigenic behaviour of breast cancer cells. These molecules are novel targets for therapeutic intervention.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-019-0566-7.Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.Ethics approval and consent to participateEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, references 06/Q1206/180 and 09/H1306/108, and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015.FundingThe study has been funded by University Grants Commission (UGC), India [F.101-5/2014(IC)] and Royal Society, UK (Ref No. IE160146).

        "content": "The biological heterogeneity of breast cancer leads to the need for finding new approaches to understand the mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression. The tumor stroma appears as a key in the progression of solid tumors towards a malignant phenotype. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may orchestrate a functional \"corrupted\" stroma which in turn helps metastatic spread. In this study, we investigated by real-time PCR, the expression of 19 factors by normal breast-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) and CAFs, which were implicated in several actions promoting tumor growth, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation and invasion. Also, we explored the influence of inflammatory cells phenotypes (MMP11 status) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) on the molecular profile of CAFs. If we consider that one of the major sources of CAFs are resident NAFs, the transition of NAFs into CAFs is associated with molecular changes involving the overexpression of some molecular factors of biological importance in tumor progression. In addition, the characterization of the tumor stroma regarding to the MMP11 status by MICs reflects a type of fibroblasts which contribute even more to tumor progression. Moreover, different patterns in the induction of the expression of factors by CAFs were observed, depending on the tumor cell line which they were co-cultured with. Furthermore, CAFs influence TGF\u03b2 expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, this study can help to a better characterization of tumor stroma in order to improve the prognostic evaluation, as well as to define the different populations of CAFs as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The tumor microenvironment has been found to play a crucial role in the process of tumor metastasis, and is primarily composed of immune cells, vascular cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, fat cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Among these cell types, fibroblasts can be activated to become cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are the most abundant cell type in the BC matrix, accounting for 80% of BC tissue. Via both autocrine and paracrine pathways, these activated CAFs acquire an invasive phenotype and promote tumor cell proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis, angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, inflammatory responses and tumor microenvironment reprogramming, thus promoting the evolution of BC. Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong association between CAFs and poor prognosis in several types of cancer, including BC. However, the mechanism by which CAFs promote the development of BC remains undefined.Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1), originally identified as an upregulated gene in injured rat arteries, is involved in vascular remodeling, osteoblast formation and wound repair. In injured and diseased arteries, CTHRC1 increases cellular motility to repair the injury by restricting the deposition of collagen matrix and promoting cellular migration. In previous years, studies have revealed that the upregulation of CTHRC1 is associated with a variety of solid tumors, to include the invasion and metastasis of tumor tissues such as those of BC. Immunohistochemical results have indicated significantly higher expression of CTHRC1 in BC than in normal tissues or precursor lesions. The results of cDNA microarray and in situ hybridization also suggested high CTHRC1 expression in BC. High CTHRC1 expression was also reported to be of prognostic value in multiple cancer types, including pancreatic, gastric, non-small cell lung and gastrointestinal stromal cancer. Furthermore, CTHRC1 overexpression was recently reported to promote human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness by activating the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. As an important component of the tumor matrix, CAFs are a key component for regulating tumor progression; active communication between CAFs and cancer cells is achieved through growth factors or inflammatory cytokines that promote tumorigenesis and progression. Although several studies have revealed the involvement of CAFs in solid tumor progression, it remains unclear whether CTHRC1 is also involved in this process, and whether it acts as an intermediary between BC and CAFs.Wnt, a member of the family of secreted signaling molecules, plays a key role in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation, embryogenesis and organogenesis, cell carcinogenesis, tumor invasion and other pathological processes. At the cellular level, such versatility of Wnt signaling is achieved by activating various intracellular signaling pathways. The canonical Wnt pathway is the best- characterized pathway, which stabilizes \u03b2-catenin proteins. An increase in \u03b2-catenin level results in its translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family of transcription factors to trigger the expression of target genes. Abnormal activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), promotes the metastasis and invasion capacities of cancer cells by decreasing the expression of cell-cell contact protein E-cadherin in vitro and in vivo. The role of CTHRC1 in the biological behaviors of BC (by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activity), especially the invasion and EMT mediated by the tumor microenvironment, remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine how CAFs regulate the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells, and how CAFs are associated with the activation of CTHRC1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in BC progression.In the current study, the expression of CTHRC1 was first verified in BC cancer tissues and serum, and their secretion sources were investigated. Then, changes in BC cell malignant behaviors were evaluated by altering the expression of CTHRC1 in the microenvironment. Finally, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) was introduced to explore the mechanisms of action of CTHRC1.Materials and methodsTissues samplesPreoperative blood samples from 43 patients with BC (provided by Cangzhou Central Hospital between August 2016 and April 2018), as well as tumor and adjacent tissues removed during surgery, were analyzed. The tumor tissue was removed from the deepest infiltration of the tumor, and the adjacent tissue was within 3 cm of the tumor. Each patient was sampled and numbered. Concurrently, blood samples from 27 healthy subjects, collected at the same hospital between July 2017 and February 2018, were selected for comparative analysis. The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Histopathological sections identified as BC; and ii) complete pathological information. The exclusion criteria were as follows: i) Patients aged <18 years; ii) patients with a history of tumor disease; and iii) patients who had received chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy. All tissue samples were identified by a clinical pathologist. Written informed consent was obtained from each study participant, and the research program was reviewed and approved by the Human Subject Research Ethics Committee of Cangzhou Central Hospital, and implemented under the guidelines formulated by the Committee. Detailed clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table I.Cell lines and reagentsCAFs and their matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from primary BC and adjacent tissues, respectively. The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 150 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and 25 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at 37\u00b0C temperature for 4 h. Thereafter, the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) until a confluent monolayer was obtained. After 2~3 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All stromal fibroblasts (CAFs and NFs) were passaged <8 times. Normal human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A (cat. no. SCSP-575) and BC cell lines HCC1937 (cat. no. TCHu148), Hs578T (cat. no. TCHu127), MCF7 (cat. no. TCHu74) and MDA-MB- 468 (cat. no. TCHu136), were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank, and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 37\u00b0C (5% CO2) in humidified air. The neutralizing CTHRC1 antibody (Ab-CTHRC1) and IgG isotype control antibody (IgG) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA. DKK1, an inhibitor of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, was purchased from StemRD, Inc.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and CTHRC1 expression detectionThe CAFs and their matching NFs were seeded into 6-well plates (2\u00d7106/well) containing serum-free DMEM. After culture at 37\u00b0C for 48 h, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for 5 min, and the supernatant (CM) was subjected to further experimentation. Prior to in vitro experiments, the CTHRC1 protein expression level in the CAF-CM and NF-CM was determined by western blotting. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.ELISAThe CTHRC1 protein levels in serum, tissue homogenates and cell culture media were quantified using a Human CTHRC1 ELISA kit (cat. no. EH135RB; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The absorbance (450 nm) of each sample was detected using a standard automatic microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). Each sample of blood, cancer tissue and adjacent tissue was divided into three for ELISA, and the CTHRC1 protein level is presented as an average value according to the experimental results. Finally, independent or paired samples were tested and analyzed according to grouping.Immunohistochemical stainingBC and adjacent tissues from the same patient were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 24 h, embedded in paraffin and cut into 5\u20136 \u00b5m-thick slices for immunohistochemical staining. Briefly, the tissue slices were placed onto a slide and heated at 60\u00b0C for 20 min, and then exposed to xylene and graded alcohol (100, 95, 90, 80 and 70%) in turn, each at room temperature for 10 min. After rinsing with water, the sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 for 10 min to remove endogenous catalases, and 10% serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used for blocking at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Rabbit anti-human CTHRC1 primary antibodies were applied at 4\u00b0C for 12 h (1:500; cat. no. MABT889; MilliporeSigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase- conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:1,000; cat. no. ab6721; Abcam) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The sections were then stained using a DAB kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) at 37\u00b0C for 5 min, and images were captured under an optical microscope. This experiment was repeated twice, and the most representative images are displayed.Invasion and migration assaysTo evaluate cellular invasiveness, an 8-\u00b5m pore polycarbonate membrane filter was inserted into each Transwell chamber and coated with 50 \u00b5l Matrigel at a final concentration of 4 mg/ml (37\u00b0C for 30 min). Then, 5\u00d7103 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded into the upper chamber with 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium, and 1 ml DMEM containing 20% FBS was added to the bottom chamber (Control group). For the experimental groups, 1 ml CAF-CM, 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 \u00b5g lgG, 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 \u00b5g Ab-CTHRC1, 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 ng DKK1, and 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 \u00b5g Ab-CTHRC1 and 100 ng DKK1 were added to the respective lower chambers. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, and the non-invasive cells were removed from the upper surface of the filter membrane. The invaded cells on the lower surface were stained with crystal violet at room temperature for 1 h, rinsed with water, and dried. Images of cells from three random visual fields per filter were captured using an optical microscope (Olympus Corporation) at \u00d7200 magnification, and then counted manually. A cellular migration assay was performed in the same manner, but without Matrigel. The experiment was performed in triplicate.MTT AssayA total of 5\u00d7103 cells per well were seeded into 96-well plates. The absorbance value was determined after incubation with CM at different concentrations of DKK1 (0, 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml) for 24 h (each concentration was repeated three times). After 24 h, the absorbance of each group of cells was measured according to the instructions of the MTT cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), and the proliferation rate was calculated based on the absorbance at 0 h. Western blotting was subsequently used to verify the effects of DKK1, and to determine the optimal concentration.Protein extraction and western blottingThe total cellular protein was extracted using a total protein extraction kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) and quantified using the BCA method. Then, 100 \u00b5g protein per lane was then electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, after which the membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight: Rabbit anti-human E-cadherin (cat. no. ab15148), rabbit anti-human N-cadherin (cat. no. ab18203), rabbit anti-human vimentin (cat. no. ab92547), rabbit anti-human \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab16051), rabbit anti-human cyclin D1 (cat. no. ab134175) and rabbit anti-human c-myc (cat. no. ab32072); all at 1:1,000, all purchased from Abcam. A GAPDH antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. ab37168; Abcam) was used as the internal reference control. Then, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody IgG (HRP) (1:5,000; cat. no. ab6721; Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, images were obtained using the multifunctional Gel Imaging System (Gel Doc XR; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), and the gray value of each band was quantified and analyzed using Quantity One software (v4.6.6; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Furthermore, the detection and evaluation of CTHRC1 protein expression levels in the CAF-CM and NF-CM were assessed in the same manner using Rabbit anti-human CTHRC1 (1:2,000; cat. no. MABT889; MilliporeSigma) as primary antibodies and GAPDH as the internal control. This experiment was performed in triplicate.Statistical analysisAll values are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp). Differences between two groups were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. However, the differences in CTHRC1 expression level between BC and adjacent tissues were examined using a paired t-test. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare differences between multiple groups (>2), followed by Tukey's post hoc test or Bonferroni's correction. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsCTHRC1 is highly expressed in CAFs in the BC tumor microenvironmentPrevious studies have shown the relevance of CTHRC1 to specific epithelial tumors, including BC. To determine the protein level and cellular source of CTHRC1 in BC, an ELISA kit was used to detect the level of CTHRC1 in the serum and tumor tissues of patients with BC. Fig. 1A and B show significant elevation of CTHRC1 protein levels in the serum and BC tissues of patients compared with healthy volunteers (P<0.01). To confirm which BC cellular component was associated with the high expression of CTHRC1, the expression pattern in BC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Fig. 1C suggests that CTHRC1-positive cells were primarily located at the boundary between tumor and stroma tissues, in stroma between tumor nests, and rarely within tumor tissues. However, CTHRC1-positive cells could not be detected in adjacent non-tumor tissues. Thus, we hypothesize that CAFs are the source of CTHRC1, and are the most abundant cell type in the breast tumor stroma. Therefore, the expression levels of CTHRC1 in CAFs, NFs, BC cell lines (HCC1937, Hs578T, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468) and normal human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A were evaluated by ELISA. CTHRC1 levels were significantly higher in BC cell lines compared with MCF10A cells (Fig. 1D; all P<0.01). Furthermore, the CTHRC1 level in CAFs was significantly higher than that in NFs (P<0.01). To confirm these results, the CTHRC1 protein expression level was evaluated in CAF-CM and NF-CM by western blotting, and revealed that the relative expression of CTHRC1 was significantly higher in CAF-CM than in NF-CM (Fig. 1E; P<0.01). These results suggest that CTHRC1 is significantly upregulated in BC, and that CAFs are a primary cell source of CTHRC1 in the BC microenvironment.CAFs enhance the migration and invasiveness of BC cells by secreting CTHRC1As BC cells are the key determinants of metastasis in tumor progression, the migration and invasion capacities of MDA-MB-468 cells (induced by CAFs) were determined. The CAF-CM-induced migration ability of MDA-MB-468 cells was significantly increased compared with that of the control group (Fig. 2A and B; P<0.01). However, the addition of a neutralizing CTHRC1 antibody (Ab-CTHRC1) significantly decreased migration compared with that of the isotype control (CAF-CM+lgG) (P<0.01). Furthermore Fig. 2C and D demonstrate that CAF-CM induction enhanced the invasive ability of MDA-MB-468 cells (P<0.01). Ab-CTHRC1 also reduced the invasiveness of MDA-MB-468 cells compared with the isotype control antibody (P<0.01). Hence, these findings indicate that CAFs enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of BC cells by secreting CTHRC1.CAFs promote EMT alterations in BC cells by secreting CTHRC1EMT is a recognized biological process that plays a key role in tumor metastasis, and is characterized by the loss of epithelial markers (such as E-cadherin) and the acquisition of stromal markers (such as N-cadherin and vimentin). To ascertain the role of CAFs in the EMT regulation of BC cells, MDA-MB-468 cells that crossed the filter membrane (under the premise of repeating the migration assay) were collected. Fig. 3A and B show that the expression of E-cadherin induced by CAF-CM was significantly decreased, while the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin was increased (all P<0.01). To determine whether CTHRC1 contributes to the EMT effect of CAFs on BC cells, Ab-CTHRC1 was added into the CAF-CM induction system. EMT was induced by CAF-CM, but was impaired by Ab-CTHRC1, revealing a reduction in E-cadherin and an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin (all P<0.01). Therefore, these findings indicate that CAFs promoted EMT alterations in BC cells by secreting CTHRC1.CAF-secreted CTHRC1 mediates the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathwayStudies have reported that CTHRC1 drives human oral cancer cell migration by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, and promotes human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness by activating Wnt/PCP signaling. However, to the best of our knowledge, their reports identifying whether CTHRC1 enhances the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation. Therefore, the effects of different induction systems on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway were determined using MDA-MB-468 cells. Fig. 4A and B suggest that CAF-CM induction markedly increased the expression of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc in MDA-MB-468 cells (all P<0.01). However, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling induced by CAF-CM and lgG was disrupted when CTHRC1 was inhibited by Ab-CTHRC1, which showed a degree of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression inhibition (all P<0.01).The blocking effect of DKK1 on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway was also assessed for its ability to inhibit the tumorigenic effects on BC cells. Fig. 4C and D indicate that the effect of DKK1 was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner, with a significant anti-proliferative effect at high concentrations. Therefore, an optimal concentration of 100 ng/ml was selected. In this instance, Fig. 4E-H indicate that compared with CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1 or CAF-CM/DKK1, CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1/DKK1 significantly reduced cellular migration and invasion ability (all P<0.01). For EMT changes, CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1/DKK1 further decreased the EMT of MDA-MB-468 cells compared with CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1 and CAF-CM/DKK1 (P<0.01). Finally, to confirm the involvement of CAF-secreted CTHRC1 in malignant phenotypes via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation, the expression changes of pathway-related proteins were assessed. Fig. 4I and J show that compared with CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1 or CAF-CM/DKK1, the CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1/DKK1 combined induction system significantly inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation (all P<0.01). The results suggest that the CTHRC1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is essential for the CAF-induced migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells.DiscussionCAFs have been reported to promote tumor growth and provide an appropriate microenvironment for the proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and invasion of a variety of cancers, by secreting different pro-oncogenic factors. Therefore, CAFs may serve as an effective tool for cancer treatment in the future. Consequently, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism by which CAFs stimulate tumor growth is of great significance for understanding BC progression and potential treatment strategies. The current study concluded that CAF-secreted CTHRC1 plays a vital role in the progression of BC. We hypothesize that CAFs promote the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells by secreting CTHRC1, which activates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Suppressing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway with a neutralizing antibody to deplete CTHRC1, or a specific inhibitor (DKK1), significantly attenuated these CAF-induced malignant phenotypes. Therefore, activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by CTHRC1 may play a useful role in the interaction between CAFs and BC cells.CTHRC1 is a secretary protein that is reportedly upregulated in various solid tumors, including melanoma, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), hepatocellular carcinoma and BC. Hou et al reported that the overexpression of CTHRC1 promoted the EMT of EOC, and was associated with poor prognosis. Ip et al revealed that CTHRC1 protein expression was weak or undetectable in non-invasive melanoma tumors, but highly expressed in invasive melanoma. In melanoma cell line-related studies, overexpression of CTHRC1 enhanced cellular migration and adhesion, and protected melanoma cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Jin et al reported that CTHRC- knockdown inhibited the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. In BC patients with bone metastasis, the stromal expression of CTHRC1 is markedly enhanced. In the current study, CTHRC1 protein levels in the serum and tumor tissues of patients with BC were significantly elevated compared with those of healthy volunteers. Furthermore, CTHRC1-positive cells were primarily located at the boundary between tumor and stroma tissues, and in stroma between tumor nests. Similar clinical results for CTHRC1 expression level have also been demonstrated in colorectal and endometrial cancer, and in others solid human tumors. In a comprehensive review, Jiang et al also noted that the multidimensional function of CTHRC1 was closely associated with its abnormal expression. Collectively, these data suggest that CTHRC1 is an important regulator of the tumor microenvironment. However, there are few studies on the specific microenvironmental origin of CTHRC1. Using cellular isolation and validation experiments, the results of the present study further demonstrated that the cells were derived from CAFs, which was the basis of subsequent experimentation. Considering previous reports, CTHRC1 was found to be a migration- and invasion-promoting protein in the tumor microenvironment. Secretion of CTHRC1, mainly by CAFs, strongly suggests that CAF-generated CTHRC1 promotes BC cell metastasis through several autocrine and paracrine processes.EMT is an important embryonic process, and a vital reversible process by which fully differentiated cells lose their epithelial features and gain a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. EMT contributes to the metastatic potential of several types of solid tumor via activating invasion-metastasis cascade responses, including in BC. A previous study reported that knockdown of CTHRC1 expression in EOC cells resulted in the downregulation of both N-cadherin and vimentin. Similarly, downregulation of CTHRC1 markedly accelerated the expression of E-cadherin, suppressed the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, and inhibited the migration and invasiveness of RCC cells. E-cadherin is an epithelial calcium-binding transmembrane glycoprotein, whose downregulation is a representative biomarker of EMT, enabling tumor cells to develop an invasive phenotype, while N-cadherin exhibits the opposite function. Migration and invasiveness are prominent biological characteristics of cancer cells, and related experiments can be used as a means to study their EMT ability. In epithelial ovarian cancer, SKOV3 and HO8910 cell migration and invasion activities were significantly increased by the CM of recombinant CTHRC1-treated macrophages. In the current study, EMT induced by CAF-CM was retarded following CTHRC1 depletion by specific neutralizing antibodies, showing a reduction in E-cadherin, an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin, and the attenuation of migration and invasion ability. These results indicate that CAF-secreted CTHRC1 significantly induced EMT. In summary, the two studies have something in common: altering the microenvironment necessary for the proliferation of cancer cells to study malignant biological changes, and achieving the desired results (that decreasing CTHRC1 expression in the tumor microenvironment significantly inhibited the migration, invasion and EMT abilities of BC cells). Thus we hypothesize that the success of the experiment lies in an understanding of the primary source of CTHRC1 and its secretion characteristics, which is of great significance for subsequent in-depth research.A growing body of evidence suggests that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway plays a key role in the carcinogenesis and progression of several types of solid tumor, including BC. Therefore, in the medical community, influencing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway has been considered an effective way to treat BC. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation leads to the stabilization and accumulation of \u03b2-catenin protein in the cytoplasm, which translocates into the nucleus and induces the transcription of downstream target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Several studies have reported that activation of these genes increases cellular proliferation, reduces cell-cell adhesion, and promotes EMT, migration and invasiveness. In the present study, CTHRC1 from CAFs promoted the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which primarily manifests in significantly upregulated levels of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. However, depleting CTHRC1 partially blocked CAF-induced activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. In addition, the combination of neutralizing antibodies and the specific inhibitor (DKK1) of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway further weakened CAF-induced pathway activation. These data demonstrate that CTHRC1 promotes the malignant biological properties of BC cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.Overall, we hypothesize that the crosstalk between BC cells and CAFs is conducive to migration, and invasiveness and EMT via the CTHRC1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Similar to normal mammary epithelial cells, CAFs are a major source of CTHRC1 protein. Extracellular CTHRC1 produced in the tumor microenvironment promotes the malignant behaviors of BC cells through autocrine and paracrine pathways. Therefore, weakening CAFs-BC cell communication by suppressing CTHRC1 expression may be a novel strategy for BC treatment. Although the present study achieved the expected results, there were some design limitations. For example, the effect on EMT of directly knocking down or increasing the expression of CTHRC1 in cancer cells was not investigated, as was by Wang et al in gastric cancer. In addition, following the administration of DKK1, necessary controls (such as without CAF-CM or lgG control) for migration and invasion were not introduced, thus it remains to be seen whether the observed effects on migration and invasion are specific to CAF-secreted CTHRC1. Future improved experiments will enhance the level of research, and focus on demonstrating the EMT-promoting effects of CTHRC1 secreted by CAFs in vivo.FundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYW conceived the present study.

Despite significant advancements in the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, there is still no licensed targeted therapy available for the treatment of TNBC, and therefore little improvement in survival has been observed for this patient population over the last years. This highlights the need for better understanding of TNBC and identification of mechanisms involved in disease progression and treatment response.It is now well recognized that breast cancer progression can be influenced by a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment surrounding the malignant epithelial cells. This environment consists of a heterogeneous mixture of stromal cells, including a diversity of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a biological active network comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM), in addition to the interstitial fluid and its solutes. New knowledge about the components of the microenvironment and how they interact with tumor cells can hopefully identify new biomarkers or potential targets in TNBC.The aberrant stroma affects the physiological forces within the tumor. Indeed, the hydrostatic pressure in the tumor interstitium, known as interstitial fluid pressure (PIF), is considerably increased in the majority of solid tumors, including human breast cancer, and this poses a major physiological barrier to transport of soluble factors within the tumor.Increased PIF has been shown to predict poor prognosis in some solid tumors, and can also hinder effective delivery of drugs into the tumor. Finding ways to lower tumor PIF may therefore increase efficiency of cancer therapy.Fibroblasts can actively modify PIF and transcapillary fluid exchange (reviewed in) and the molecular mechanisms are outlined by collagen contraction assays and heterospheroids, as well as parallel in vivo experiments. Dysfunctional blood and lymph vessels will lead to fluid accumulation in the tumor interstitium, and swelling of hyaluronan and proteoglycans would in normal conditions hinder an increase in PIF. Tension exerted by fibroblasts and collagen network can probably counteract this swelling, resulting in a persistent increased PIF. However, although fibroblast-mediated contraction has previous been shown to be dependent on \u03b21-integrins, fibroblast-mediated PIF influence is still not fully understood.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is a collagen binding integrin expressed during differentiation of myofibroblasts and is involved in collagen organization and tumor stiffness. As a collagen organizer and a link between contractile fibroblasts and the complex collagen network, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 could be a regulator of tumor PIF. Although a few studies indicate that it has a physiological role in the regulation of PIF in dermis, its influence on PIF in tumors remains to be demonstrated. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate pressure homeostasis within a tumor, can probably lead to a new insight into breast carcinogenesis, and we therefore investigated the effect of stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency on pressure homeostasis, ECM organization and tumor growth using two human TNBC xenograft models.MethodsCell linesMDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) was provided by Professor James Lorens (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway), and MDA-MB-468 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-132\u2122) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA., USA). The MDA-MB-231 cells were fingerprinted before use and matched with the cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) in the ATCC database. MDA-MB-231 was used at passage number five to nine, while the MDA-MB-468 cells were used at passage number two to five. These TNBC cell lines have high tumor take in SCID mice and slowly forming tumors, which may be more stromal dependent than more rapidly growing xenografts. Wild type (WT) and integrin \u03b111-deficient (\u03b111-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from mouse embryos of embryonic day 14.5 as described previously. In order to obtain immortalized MEFs, primary MEF cultures were infected with recombinant retrovirus-transducing simian virus 40 (SV40). All cell lines were grown in Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 100\u2009units/ml penicillin, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 1\u20132% L-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were grown as single monolayers in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and in all experiments used at log phase. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Xenograft modelsThe integrin \u03b111-deficient heterozygous SCID mouse strain was generated as previously described. PCR-genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from ear biopsies. The animals were kept in individually ventilated cages, cared for regularly and efforts were made to age- and weight match the animals. All animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Permit Number 20168751) which is the competent body responsible for authorizing research projects in animals in Norway. This is in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63 article 36.A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 or 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-468 tumor cells in 0.15\u2009ml PBS were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad (orthotopic), and for the MDA-MB-231 also subcutaneously on the mouse flank (ectopic). Tumor size was measured using a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula; tumor volume (mm3)\u2009=\u2009(\u03c0/6)\u2009\u00d7\u2009a2\u00a0\u00d7\u2009b, where a represents the shortest diameter and b represents the longest diameter of the tumor. All animals were anesthetized using Isofluran (Isoba\u00aevet. 100%, Schering-Plough A/S, Farum, Denmark) and eventually sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia. For investigation of the primary tumor, all the MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed day 57 post injection. For the MDA-MB-468 injected mice, some of the tumors showed tendency to ulcerate the skin, and these mice were sacrificed immediately. To make the groups comparable, one mouse from the opposite group and with similar tumor load was sacrificed on the same day.To evaluate metastatic spread to the lungs, they were processed and fixed as previously described (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 5 \u03b111-KO and n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 4 \u03b111-KO for the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 injected mice, respectively).All measurements and analysis in this study were performed blinded to genotype.Measurement of interstitial fluid pressureThe wick-in-needle technique was used to measure the tumor PIF. Briefly, a standard 23-gauge needle with a side hole filled with nylon floss and saline was connected to a PE-50 catheter, a pressure transducer and a computer for pressure registrations, using the software Powerlab chart (version 5, PowerLab/ssp. AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). The needle was inserted into the central part of the tumor after calibration. After a period of stable pressure measurements, the fluid communication was tested by clamping the catheter which shall cause a transient rise and then return to pressure prior to clamping. Measurements were accepted if the pre- to post-clamping value was within \u00b11\u2009mmHg.PIF in heterospheroids was measured with the micropuncture technique described previously. Briefly, the spheroids were collected and transferred to 10-cm Lysine-coated cell culture dishes (Nunc, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA., USA) and left to attach for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. PIF was measured using sharpened glass capillaries (tip diameter 3\u20135\u2009\u03bcm) connected to a servo-controlled counter pressure system. The glass capillaries were filled with hypertonic saline (0.5\u2009M) colored with Evans blue dye and inserted into the central parts of the spheroid with the help of a stereomicroscope (Wild M5, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). PIF in the cell culture medium directly outside the spheroid was defined as the zero reference pressure.Electron microscopy of collagen fibrils in the tumorTumor samples were taken from the tumor periphery and were fixed and processed as previously described. A JEM-1230 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the diameter and organization of the collagen fibrils, and images from four to six different areas of the tissue were analyzed. Pictures were captured at \u00d7\u2009100,000 magnification and analyzed using Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) to measure the fibril diameter. To investigate the organization of the collagen fibrils, pictures were captured at \u00d7\u200930,000 magnification and scored from one to four considering collagen fibril organization and alignment within the collagen fibers.A JSM-7400F Scanning Electron microscope (Jeol) was used to study the tumor collagen fibril scaffold architecture. Five images from different areas of the tumor were captured from each tumor at \u00d7\u200910,000 magnification.Immunostaining and Picrosirius-red stainingHistological analysis was performed on both paraffin embedded sections and cryosections. For paraffin embedded sections, 5\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were deparaffinizated and rehydrated, followed by heat induced antigen retrieval at pH\u20096 (#S1699, Dako, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA., USA) for Ki67 (100\u2009\u00b0C, 20\u2009min) and \u03b1SMA (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min), pH\u20099 (#2367, Dako) for Coll III (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min) or pH\u200910 (#T6455, Sigma Aldrich) for PDGFR\u03b2 (110\u2009\u00b0C, 5\u2009min). After antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated with peroxidase block (#K006, Dako) and then primary antibody. Envision+ System-HRP (#K4006 or #K4010, Dako) was used as secondary antibody, in addition to rabbit anti-goat for collagen III (1:1000, #6164\u201301, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL., USA), and DAB was used as chromogen, except for \u03b1SMA staining, where a FITC-conjugated antibody was used. Analysis of immunohistochemistry was performed using Leica DN 2000 Led (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The following primary antibodies were used on paraffin sections: rabbit anti-mouse PDGFR\u03b2 mAb (1:100, #3169, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA., USA), goat anti-mouse Type III Collagen pAb (1:100, #1330\u201308, Southern Biotech), anti-mouse \u03b1SMA mAb (F3777, dilution 1:200, Sigma Aldrich) and mouse anti-human Ki67 mAb (1:100, #M7240, Dako).Cryosections with a thickness of 6\u2009\u03bcm were fixed in ice-cold methanol (\u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C, 8\u2009min) and rehydrated with PBS, followed by blocking with 10% goat serum. Afterwards, the following primary antibodies were supplied: rabbit anti-mouse integrin \u03b111 pAb (1:200, custom-made, Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden,), mouse anti-human cytokerain AE1/AE3 mAb (1:200, #M3515, Dako) and mouse anti \u03b1SMA mAb (1:200, #A5228, Sigma Aldrich). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1:400, #111\u2013585-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ink., West Grove, PA., USA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:400, #315\u2013545-045, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. Mounting was done with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (#P36934, ThermoFisher). The staining results were evaluated under an Axioscope fluorescence microscope and micrographs were acquired using a digital AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Picrosirius-red stain (Polysciences inc, Warrington, FL., USA) was used for a semi-quantitative measurement of collagen type I and III as previously described.Evaluation of the stainingFor Picrosirius-red, collagen III, PDGFR\u03b2 and \u03b1SMA, a total of four to six pictures were captured from each tumor with \u00d7\u2009100 magnification. Images were taken in the tumor periphery in order to avoid the necrotic central area. The software Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) was used to identify the amount of positive pixels.For Ki67, the tumors were examined using light microscopy with an eye-piece grid at \u00d7\u2009630 magnification. A total of 500 tumor cells from the tumor periphery were evaluated, and distinct nuclear staining regardless of intensity was registered as positive. Areas with necrosis, bleeding or inflammation were avoided.MicrodialysisMicrodialysis was performed as previously described on the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors. Briefly, after anesthesia with Ketalar (Pfizer Inc., NY., USA) and Dormitor (Orin Pharma AS, Espoo, Finland), one microdialysis probe was placed in the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor (CMA12 Elite Microdialysis probe, ref.nr 8,010,434) and one in the jugular vein (CMA12 Elite Metal free, ref.nr 80,111,204). The probes were connected to a PE-50 catheter, perfused by a pump (CMA100 Microinjection pump, ref.nr 8,210,040) at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcl/min and left to stabilize for 30\u2009min. After intravenous injection of 0.15\u2009ml 0.65\u2009MBq 3H-5FU (Nycomed Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), dialysate was sampled and pooled every 10\u2009min for a total of 90\u2009min. Scintillation counting solution (Optiphase Hisafe 3, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA., USA) was added, and the radioactivity measured using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Carb 2900TR, PerkinElmer, Inc.). The probes and pump were delivered by CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden.The area under the curve (AUC) for the plasma and tumor was calculated with Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA., USA) as the total radioactivity collected, i.e. as the product of radioactivity (counts per minute) and time. Finally, transport of 3H-5FU was expressed as AUC tumor divided by AUC plasma.After each experiment, the probes were tested in saline with a known amount of 3H-5FU, and experiments with probes that differed more than 15% in permeability were excluded.HeterospheroidsHeterospheroids containing a mixture of SV40-immortalized MEFs and MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared using the hanging drop method as described previously. Briefly, sub-confluent cells were trypsinized and suspended in culture medium to a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/ml. The MEFs (WT or integrin \u03b111-KO MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 cell suspensions were then mixed at a ratio of 4:1 to make WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 and \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. Approximately 40 drops (25\u2009\u03bcl/ drop, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/drop) were dispensed onto a lid of a cell culture dish. The lid was then inverted and placed over a cell culture dish containing medium for humidity, and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5\u2009days.Statistical analysisSigmaplot 13.0 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL., USA) and Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) were used for statistical analysis. Either the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Mann- Whitney U test, was used to analyze statistical differences between the two groups. Results were accepted as statistically different when p\u2009<\u20090.05. Data are given as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and number of measurements (n) refers to number of tumors or heterospheroids unless otherwise specified.ResultsEffect of stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 on breast tumor growthTumor growth. The growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (a-c) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 and 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 MDA-MB-468 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad, and for MDA-MB-231, also subcutaneously (s.c.) on the back. All MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed at day 57 post injection. The MDA-MB-468 injected mice were sacrificed at different time points starting with n\u2009=\u200920 WT and n\u2009=\u200916 \u03b111-KO. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. ** p\u2009<\u20090.01.

Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmMDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 tumor cells were injected into WT and \u03b111-KO mice. As expected, we found that integrin \u03b111 was expressed in the tumor stroma in WT mice, but not in \u03b111-KO mice (Fig.\u00a01d). Furthermore, the immunofluorescent staining of integrin \u03b111 (Fig. 1d) did not show differences in the amount of integrin \u03b111 expression between the MDA-MB-231 orthotropic and subcutaneous model (n\u2009=\u20093\u20135). The tumor volumes in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors were significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in \u03b111-KO mice compared to tumors grown in WT mice during their 57\u2009days growth period (Fig. 1a). A clear tendency towards reduced MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor growth was also seen, but this did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.059) (Fig. 1b). Of note, there was no difference in MDA-MB-231 tumor growth when the cells were injected subcutaneously on the back (Fig. 1c).Tumor cell proliferation.

However, in the two other tumor models, there were no significant differences in number of proliferating tumor cells (Fig. 2b-d).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduces tumor interstitial fluid pressureTumor interstitial fluid pressure.

Transmission electron microscopy pictures from the xenograft tumors were scored from 1 to 4 according to collagen organization. The average collagen organization score per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) were lower in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (n\u2009=\u20098 WT and n\u2009=\u20097 \u03b111-KO mice in both models).

Scale bar indicates 1\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril organization and structure in the xenograft tumors were investigated using TEM. As seen in Fig.\u00a05a-b and d, integrin \u03b111-deficiency lead to more disorganized collagen fibril architecture with fewer aligned collagen fibrils in both the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor models. In these tumors, there was also a shift towards thinner collagen fibrils in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice (Fig. 6a-b and d). No difference was seen in either collagen fibril alignment or collagen fibril diameter in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors when comparing \u03b111-KO mice with WT (Figs. 5c and 6c). In addition, SEM did not demonstrate visual differences in the collagen fibril structure between tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice versus WT (Fig. 7).\u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2. The total fraction of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), \u03b1SMA (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (c). Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmImmunostaining of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2, common markers of activated fibroblasts and pericytes, was used to quantify the relative amount of activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. Although integrin \u03b111 partially co-localized with \u03b1SMA in xenograft tumors in WT mice (Fig. 8c), no significant differences in the amount of PDGFR\u03b2 or \u03b1SMA expression (Fig. 8a-b and Additional file 1: Figure S1) in tumors in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice were found.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 does not affect uptake of 3H-5FUMicrodialysis. Dialysate was sampled for 90\u2009min after i.v. injection of 3H-5FU, and the ratio between 3H-5FU level in plasma and in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor was calculated as Area Under Curve (AUC). There was no significant difference in uptake when WT and \u03b111-KO mice were compared (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDThe reduced tumor PIF found in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice was not associated with increased uptake of 3H-5FU measured by microdialysis (Fig. 9).Pressure homeostasis and integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in heterospheroidsHeterospheroids. The individual interstitial fluid pressures (PIF) in heterospheroids containing a mixture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells (4:1) (a). \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids showed a significant reduction in PIF compared to WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. *** p\u2009<\u20090.001. Transmission electron microscopy images show collagen fibrils in both heterospheroid types (b)Since the in vivo results demonstrate that stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining pressure homeostasis in triple-negative breast xenograft tumors, we also investigated the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on tumor PIF in a simplified system. Spheroids composed of fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b111 grown together with MDA-MB-231 cells had significantly lower PIF compared to spheroids with MDA-MB-231 cells and WT fibroblasts (Fig. 10a-b). These data indicate that the difference in PIF is, at least in part, due to integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Tumor metastasesNo lung metastases were seen when investigating coronal HE stained sections from lungs at end stage.DiscussionIntegrins are essential adhesion receptors necessary for intercellular communication, attachment of cells to the ECM and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we have demonstrated that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency markedly decreased PIF in vivo using two orthotopic human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. A perturbed collagen structure was seen, with fewer aligned and thinner collagen fibrils. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency impeded orthotopic breast tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 model, and the same trend was also found in the MDA-MB-468 orthotopic model. By investigating the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on MDA-MB-231 tumor cells in vitro, we provide here evidence that PIF regulation is, at least partly, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has arisen as a possible marker of a pro-tumorigenic subset of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in the stroma of lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Further, it stimulates lung cancer cell growth in vitro, and lung and prostate cancer growth in vivo. However, its role in tumor growth and progression is still not clear, especially in breast tumors where we recently reported that it did not affect the growth of the murine TNBC cell line 4\u2009T1 in vivo.In the present study, we found that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to reduced tumor PIF in both orthotopic xenograft models. This demonstrates for the first time that integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining an elevated PIF in solid tumors. A dense ECM, contractile fibroblasts, leaky blood vessels and dysfunctional lymphatic drainage are possible causes of increased PIF in tumors. PIF can be actively modulated through interactions between contractile fibroblasts and ECM molecules, where fibroblasts have been proposed to normally exert a tension on the collagen network through collagen-binding integrins. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 contracts collagen matrices experimentally, and we therefore suggest that integrin \u03b111\u03b21-mediated PIF modifications can involve a contraction of the interstitial space mediated by direct or indirect binding of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts to collagen.The involvement of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts in tumor PIF homeostasis is supported by our study of heterospheroids, where we observed a similar PIF reduction in spheroids composed of MDA-MB-231 cells and integrin \u03b111-deficient fibroblasts. This simplified system allows us to investigate how fibroblasts grown together with tumor cells can influence PIF. In line with our results, a similar integrin \u03b111\u03b21 function in pressure regulation has previously been shown in fibroblasts/lung cancer heterospheroids. However, although these avascular spheroid studies indicate that the pressure regulatory abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is, at least in part, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts, the mechanisms behind integrin \u03b111-mediated effect on PIF in heterospheroids are not investigated in detail in this study. In addition, we cannot exclude additional factors in the more complex in vivo system, such as influence of the tumor vasculature, which has been shown to have an important impact on tumor PIF.Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to less organized and thinner collagen fibrils in the orthotopic models, which could be a contributing factor to reduced tumor PIF. Although it has been shown that the collagen-binding proteoglycan fibromodulin promotes the formation of a dense stroma and increased tumor PIF, it is nevertheless difficult to predict how different components in the extracellular matrix affect the hydraulic conductivity of tissues and thereby fluid flow and PIF.Although the present study is the first to identify integrin \u03b111\u03b21 as participating in regulation of pressure in solid tumors, it is already known to maintain a homeostatic PIF in dermis. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated the function of \u03b21-integrins in the regulation of dermal PIF by inhibiting \u03b21-integrins.Numerous studies have highlighted the role of CAFs in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis, either directly by stimulation of tumor cells via production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors or indirectly by for example remodeling the ECM (reviewed in). Here we show that integrin \u03b111\u03b21, known to be expressed during myofibroblast differentiation, seems to facilitate breast tumor growth in vivo.In previous studies, the pro-tumorigenic abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 have been associated with increased matrix stiffness, collagen reorganization and increased levels of IGF-2. In the present study, changes in pressure homeostasis and collagen organization could both influence tumor growth and invasion. Of interest, increased tumor PIF has been linked to tumor aggressiveness in some human cancers, and is an independent poor prognostic factor in cervical cancer.There have been reports suggesting that increased tumor PIF can both facilitate and inhibit tumor progression. First, major pressure gradients due to increased tumor PIF can enhance interstitial fluid flow at and lymph drainage from the tumor margins, which probably increase the risk of cancer cells leaving the tumor. Increased flow can also facilitate tumor progression indirectly by either mechano-modulation of the tumor stroma or by changing the host immune response and thereby promote immunological tolerance (reviewed in). Further, in vitro elevation of tumor PIF increased proliferation of human osteosarcoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Similarly, in vivo lowering of tumor PIF, and thereby reduction of mechanical stretch for 24\u2009h, reduced tumor cell proliferation in vulva and lung xenograft tumors. However, contrary to these findings, increased tumor PIF may also limit uptake of nutrition and growth factors into the tumor and thereby inhibit tumor cell progression. In the context of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 cells have actually been shown to invade towards regions of higher pressure in vitro, indicating that the elevated tumor PIF may in fact restrain breast tumor invasion. In summary, these findings demonstrate that maintenance of a high tumor PIF may be a contributing factor to integrin \u03b111\u03b21\u2019s pro-tumorigenic effects, but at the same time, it can have opposite effects during tumorigenesis, pinpointing the need for further preclinical investigation.Although increased tumor PIF can be a major barrier in cancer treatment, lowering of tumor PIF by integrin \u03b111-deficiency did not increase the uptake of the low molecular weight drug 3H-5FU into MDA-MB-231 tumor interstitium. Low molecular weight compounds are transported by both diffusion and bulk flow/convection, and we have previously shown that reducing PIF can increase the uptake of the small molecular weight drugs 3H-5FU and 51Cr-EDTA into the tumor interstitium. However, in parallel with the results in the present study, it is evident that lowering of PIF will not always increase the uptake of low molecular weight drugs. Similarily, Flessner et al. showed that decapsulation of ovarian xenografts markedly decreased PIF to zero, but did not increase penetration of the high molecular weight drug trastuzumab into the tumor. In summary, probably other features of the tumor microenvironment can also contribute to the failure of transport within solid tumors.Our data show that integrin \u03b111-deficiency leads to thinner and less organized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumor stroma. Changes in collagen composition and organization are already known to influence tumorigenesis and can predict breast cancer behavior. For example, progressive deposition of collagen and increased collagen fiber linearization are associated with breast cancer aggressiveness.While integrin \u03b111-deficiency influenced tumor growth and reduced PIF with concomitantly more disorganized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumors, no effect was seen in the MDA-MB-231 ectopic tumors. Interestingly, there was similar amount of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression in both the MDA-MB-231 models. In a previous study, we also observed that while integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduced RM11 tumor growth, but did not affect 4\u2009T1 tumor growth, the integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression was not higher in RM11 than in 4\u2009T1 tumors. Thus, differences in integrin \u03b111\u03b21-expression cannot explain the contrasting effect seen in these in vivo models.The different effects seen between the MDA-MB-231 orthotopic and ectopic tumors show that tumor location significantly influences the effect of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in vivo. The tumor microenvironment displays a significant heterogeneity, and the subcutaneous location probably does not always give rise to a representative tissue-specific stromal infiltration. Supporting the fact that the organ-specific fibroblasts influence breast tumor growth differently, co-injection of breast fibroblast with breast tumor cells increased tumor growth, whereas no enhancement was seen with the co-injection of skin fibroblasts. The significance of the local microenvironment illustrates the complexity of in vivo studies, and may explain some of the discrepancies seen with different mouse models. This underlines the importance of choosing the appropriate preclinical model, particularly when investigating the tumor microenvironment. If possible, orthotopic models should be preferred rather than ectopic ones.ConclusionOur findings indicate an important role for integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in interstitial fluid pressure regulation in the breast tumor microenvironment. Further, since integrin \u03b111\u03b21 seems to impede breast cancer growth, it may be an interesting candidate for stromal targeted therapy.Additional fileAbbreviations3H-5FU3H-5-Fluorouracil5FU5-FluorouracilAUCArea under the curveCAFSCancer associated fibroblastsDAB3,3\u2032-DiaminobenzidineECMExtracellular matrixHEHematoxylin and eosinHER-2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IGF-2Insulin-like growth factor 2MABMonoclonal antibodyMBqMegabecquerelMEFsMouse embryonic fibroblastsPABPolyclonal antibodyPBSPhosphate buffered salinePDGFR\u03b2Platelet-derived growth factor receptor betaPIFInterstitial fluid pressureS.C.SubcutaneousSCIDSevere combined immunodeficiencySEMScanning electron microscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerWTWild type\u03b111-KOIntegrin \u03b111-deficient\u03b1SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinAuthors\u2019 contributionsConceived and designed the experiments: HYHS LS RKR.

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. SUM149PT, SUM159PT and SUM229PE (provided by Dr. Stephen P Ethier) were grown in F-12 HAM'S nutrient mixture (HyClone Laboratories, Inc. Logan, Utah, USA) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

MDA and SCPs cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b21 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine. For stable cell line generation, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and pools of stable cells were selected with 10 ng/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs in the absence of insulin and hydrocortisone before TGF\u03b21 stimulation.Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitationCells were lysed in cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin hydrochloride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal protein was analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-p21 (F5), mouse anti-c-myc, mouse anti-p15, rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-cofilin and cofilin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and followed by secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or rabbit. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4\u00b0C using antibodies against p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (Abcam\u00ae, Cambridge, MA, USA) and p21. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was added for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and washed four times with cold lysis buffer. The immunocomplexes were boiled with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.Histone proteins extractionTotal histone proteins were extracted as previously described. Briefly, 80% confluent of SCP2 cells from a 100-mm tissue culture plate were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 or 1 \u00b5M trichostatin A (TSA). SCP2 cells were harvested and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 \u00b5M TSA and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u00b5l trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes. Total histone proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an acetylated lysine antibody (Millipore).DNA affinity precipitation assaySCP2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated siRNAs were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. Cell lysate were extracted in cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors as described above. A total of 5 \u00b5g Poly (dI-dC) competitor (Sigma) was incubated with 1 mg of total cell lysate for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. A total of 500 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides (IDT) was added and incubated with cell lysates for two hours at 4\u00b0C. Streptavidin-agarose beads (65 \u00b5l; Sigma) were added, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose beads containing biotinylated oligonucleotides and protein complex were boiled with 2\u00d7 SDS Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting. The sequences of biotin labeled double-strand oligonucleotides (IDT) were previously described.

Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equipment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s). The primer sequences were as follows: IL8 forward primer, GCAGAGGCCACCTGGATTGTGC; reverse primer, TGGCATGTTGCAGGCTCCTCAGAA; IL6 forward primer, CTCCCCTCCAGGAGCCCAGC; reverse primer, GCAGGGAAGGCAGCAGGCAA; PLAU forward primer, GCCCTGGTTTGCGGCCATCT; reverse primer, CGCACACCTGCCCTCCTTGG; MMP9 forward primer, TGGACACGCACGACGTCTTCC; reverse primer, TAGGTCACGTAGCCCACTTGGTCC; PTGS2 forward primer, AGCTTTCACCAACGGGCTGGG; reverse primer, AAGACCTCCTGCCCCACAGCAA; TGFBI forward primer, CGGCTGCTGCTGAAAGCCGACCA; reverse primer, GGTCGGGGCCAAAAGCGTGT; p21 forward primer, TGTCCGCGAGGATGCGTGTTC; reverse primer, GCAGCCCGCCATTAGCGCAT; GAPDH forward primer, GCCTCAAGATCATCAGCAATGCCT; reverse primer, TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGAT.Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assayA total of 100 \u00b5l of cell suspension (1\u00d7 105 cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS) was stimulated or not in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 and cultured in 96-well plates for two days. After two days, 25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity.

B, Overall pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF immunohistochemistry staining intensity between lymph node negative (LN-) and positive (LN+) tissues. C, Percentage of case distribution according to immunoreactivity of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF in tumor cells, the score for negative (0), low (1 to 2) and high (3 to 4).DiscussionWhile p21 was initially characterized as an important cell cycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic p21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatory functions. The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.IntroductionThe cooperative interactions among tumor cells and reactive stroma strongly contribute to cancer development and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been indicated as the main cellular component of the tumor microenvironment involved in cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. In breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics through multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of new blood vessels, mainly generated by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Indeed, mechanisms of cell sensing and adaptation to stressful environments are activated within the hypoxic tumor mass, leading to the growth and aggressiveness of malignant cells. The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) primarily mediates the cell responses to a low oxygen tension playing a crucial role in cancer development. In particular, HIF-1 activates a signaling transduction network which drives the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of the hypoxia-inducible \u03b1 subunit and the constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 dimerize upon exposure to hypoxia, generating a complex which binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of target genes. In this regard, it has been shown that HIF-1 is a leading regulator of tumor angiogenesis following hypoxia, as it regulates the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors, like the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Recently, we discovered a further HIF-1-regulated gene, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), which contributes to the adaptation to a low oxygen environment in breast cancer cells and in cardiomyocytes. In particular, we found that the cooperation between GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 upon exposure to hypoxia leads to the up-regulation of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which is a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER. Surprisingly, we also assessed that in CAFs derived from breast cancer malignancies GPER acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. On the basis of these data, GPER-mediated functions may be included among the mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment.Considering that hypoxia regulates HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of both GPER and VEGF in different model systems, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential involvement of GPER in the expression and function of VEGF in CAFs and breast cancer cells. In this regard, we demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates the up-regulation of VEGF as well as the endothelial tube formation, suggesting that this transduction pathway may be involved in the intricate stimulatory responses to hypoxia within the cancer stroma. Our data may open new perspectives towards innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the breast cancer microenvironment.Materials and methodsReagentsCobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Srl (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) was obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). Human CTGF was purchased from MBL International Corporation, distributed by Eppendorf, (Milan, Italy). Human VEGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC, CTGF and VEGF, which were solubilized in water.Ethics statementAll procedures conformed to the Helsinki Declaration for the research on humans. The experimental research has been performed with the ethical approval provided by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital in Cosenza, Italy.Cell culturesThe SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The murine cardiomyocyte-like cell line HL-1 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA). In particular, the HL-1 cell line was established from a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor excised from an adult female Jackson Laboratory-inbred C57BLy6J mouse (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). HL-1 cells were cultured according to the published protocol in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Bioscience, Sigma-Aldrich Srl), 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 0.1 mM norepinephrine (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). All cell lines were grown in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were treated with CoCl2 or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) in a HeraCell incubator (ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy). Cells were switched to medium without serum the day before experiments.Isolation, cultivation and characterization of CAFsCAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies as previously described. Signed informed consent from all the patients and IRB approval were obtained. In particular, tissues obtained were cut into smaller pieces (1 to 2 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for two minutes. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485 \u00d7 g for eight minutes, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham's F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) and cultured at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. In each patient, a second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. We used CAFs and fibroblasts passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. Primary cells cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001), all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy). In order to assess fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All experiments were performed in each CAF population obtained from six patients. Data presented were obtained in CAFs derived from one patient; however, results similar to those shown were found in CAFs derived from the other five patients.Gene reporter assaysThe 2.6 kb VEGF promoter-luciferase construct containing full-length VEGF promoter sequence (22,361 to +298 bp relative to the transcription start site) used in luciferase assays was a kind gift from Dr. Pal Soumitro (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). CAFs or SkBr3 cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u03bcL/well culture medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 h with control shRNA, shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER. Next, a mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was transfected within cells. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). After 8 h, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed to low oxygen (2% O2) for 12 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) normalized to the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as one-fold induction, from which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.Gene expression studiesTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not degraded and showed clear 18S and 28S bands under ultraviolet light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected genes was quantified by both real-time RT-PCR using Step One\u00ae sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Milan, Italy) and semiquantitative RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and are as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'-TGCATCTCCATCTTCTACCCAAGT-3' and Rev: 5'-CCGACTGTGAGTGCCACTGT-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'-ACACACCTGGGTGGACACAA-3' and Rev: 5'-GGAGCCAGAAGCCACATCTG-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ACCTGTGGGATGGGCATCT-3' and Rev: 5'-CAGGCGGCTCTGCTTCTCTA-3'; VEGF (human): Fwd: 5'- TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-3' and Rev: 5'- TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'- GGAGATCCTTCGAGGAGCACTT-3' and Rev: 5'- GGCGATTTA GCAGCAGATATAAGAA-3'; 18S (human, mouse) Fwd: 5'-GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-3' and Rev: 5'- GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT -3. The ribosomal protein 18S was used as a control gene to obtain normalized values.For semiquantitative PCR, primers were as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'- GCTGATTTGTGAACCCAT TC-3' and Rev: 5'- CTGTACTGTCCTGTGGTGAC-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'- CTGGGGAGTTTCCTG TCTGA -3' and Rev: 5'-GCTTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ATGGCATGAAGCCAGAGAGT-3' and Rev: 3'-GGTCAGTGAGCACGCTAAAA-3'; VEGF (human) Fwd: 5'-GAGCTTCAGGACATTGCTGT-3' and Rev: 5'-AGGAAGGTCAACCACTCACA-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3' and Rev: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3'; 36B4 (human) Fwd: 5'-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3' and Rev: 5'-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3'; GAPDH (mouse) Fwd: 5'-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3' and Rev: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'. 36B4 and GAPDH were used as control genes to obtain normalized values.Western blot analysisTo prepare lysates, CAFs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 50 mM Hepes solution, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to the Bradford method. Cell lysates (10 to 50 \u03bcg of protein) were electrophoresed through a reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary polyclonal IgG antibody for HIF-1\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Celbio, Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), CTGF (L-20), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), \u03b2-actin (C2), b-tubulin (H-235-2) and appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA). The levels of proteins and phosphoproteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and revealed using the ECL\u00ae System (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).Gene silencing experimentsCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected for 24 h before treatments with a control vector or an independent shRNA sequence for each target gene using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics). The shRNA plasmid for HIF-1\u03b1 and the respective control plasmids were purchased from SABioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA). The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by the construct which we have previously described and used.Immunofluorescence microscopyFifty percent confluent cultured CAFs, SkBr3 and HL-1 cells grown on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed for 12 h to low oxygen tension (2% O2). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments, cells were previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids (as described above) and then treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, or cultured under hypoxia as indicated. Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging System supported by quantification and image processing software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (Leica Microsystems CMS, GbH Mannheim, Germany) were used for experiment evaluation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCAFs were grown in 10-cm dishes to 60 to 70% confluence, serum deprived for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, USA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primer for the -1,216 to -883 region of the human VEGF promoter containing the HRE site is 5'-CACAGACCTTCACAGCCATC-3' (forward hHRE) and 5'-CCCAGCGTAGACAGTTGAGT-3' (reverse hHRE). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation. For knockdown experiments CAFs were previously transfected in serum-free medium for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and the respective control shRNA (as described above) and then treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2.Migration assayMigration assays were performed with CAFs in triplicate using Boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8 mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich Srl). CAFs were transfected with shRNA constructs directed against HIF-1\u03b1, GPER or with an unrelated control shRNA construct in regular growth medium. After 24 h, cells were exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 6 h in medium without serum. Then, cells were maintained for 24 h in normoxic conditions (20% O2) in medium without serum. This experimental condition has been designed in order to reproduce the unbalanced oxygenation occurring within solid tumors, where the irregular blood flow is responsible for hypoxia and reoxygenation phases. CAFs were, therefore, trypsinized and seeded in the upper chambers. CTGF (100 ng/mL) was added to the medium without serum in the bottom wells where applicable. Six hours after seeding, cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed and counted.Conditioned mediumCAFs were cultured in regular growth medium to 80% confluence. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with shHIF-1\u03b1, shGPER or control shRNA using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions for 12 h. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in HUVECs.Protein precipitation with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)Conditioned medium from CAFs (see above) was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and 10 \u03bcg/mL BSA (final concentration) was added as a control for precipitation efficiency. TCA (100% solution) was added to a final concentration of 20% to conditioned media. After a 20-minute incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 31,000 g for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C). Pellets were washed with cold acetone, centrifuged at 31,000 g for 30 minutes (4\u00b0C), air dried and resuspended in protein lysis buffer (described above). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford Method and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using 100 \u03bcg protein/lane.Tube formation assayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37\u00b0C in serum free medium (EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen, Inc., Helgerman Court, Gaithersburg, USA) was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates and left at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Invitrogen), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel\u00ae and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls' testing to determine differences in means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsHypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression in CAFsIn order to provide further insight into the response to hypoxia in main components of the tumor microenvironment like CAFs, we began our study showing that hypoxia induces the mRNA expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene GPER, as ascertained by real time PCR (Figure 1) and semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). In particular, CAFs were treated from 1 h to 24 h with the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2 (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 1a) or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1b). The induction of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mRNA expression was paralleled by increased protein levels of these factors in CAFs treated from 1 h to 24 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 1c) or exposed to a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1d). Next, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the induction of GPER by CoCl2 was abrogated (Figure 1e, Additional file 1a), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in CAFs exposed to hypoxic conditions. In order to assess the transduction signaling involved in the aforementioned responses, we determined the rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation (from 15 minutes up to 60 minutes) following the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 2a). Accordingly, we observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation culturing CAFs in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (Figure 2b). Next, the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 30 minutes in the presence of 300 \u03bcM of the ROS scavenger NAC did not induce the ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). Moreover, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER observed treating CAFs for 3 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 was no longer evident in the presence of 300 \u03bcM NAC and 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor PD (Figure 2d). On the basis of these results, it could be argued that hypoxia-induced ROS may trigger the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is involved in the up-regulation of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression.Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs. (a-d) The exposure to 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a, c) or low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 3 h) (b, d) up-regulate the mRNA (a, b) and protein (c, d) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER as evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In RNA experiments, values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle.

Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to ERK/2 or \u03b2-actin.

As shown in Figure 3a, the treatment with CoCl2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF in a time-dependent manner in both CAFs and SkBr3 breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in a completely different model system, such as HL-1 cardiomyocytes (Additional file 2). Next, CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) activated a VEGF promoter reporter gene which was transfected in CAFs and SkBr3 cells (Figure 3b, c). Notably, the aforementioned transcriptional response to hypoxia was abrogated knocking-down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 3d, e and Additional file 1c, d). CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) promoted also VEGF protein expression in CAFs, as evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4). The induction of VEGF protein levels was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 5 and Additional file 1a, b), further highlighting their involvement in the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia. Analogously, the up-regulation of VEGF protein expression upon exposure to hypoxia in SkBr3 (Figure 6a) and HL-1 cells (Figure 7a) was no longer evident, knocking down the expression of GPER (Figures 6b and 7b and Additional file 1e) and HIF-1 \u03b1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the regulation of VEGF expression induced by hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF.

The transactivation of the VEGF promoter observed in SkBr3 cells treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER expression (e). The luciferase activities were normalized to the internal transfection control and values of cells receiving vehicle or cultured under normoxia were set as one-fold induction upon which the activities induced by CoCl2 treatment or hypoxia were calculated.

Images shown are representative of 20 random fields of three independent experiments.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the VEGF promoter and involved in VEGF-mediated tube formation induced by hypoxiaAs HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are required for the hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, we next determined by ChIP assay that HIF-1\u03b1 (Figure 8a) and GPER (Figure 8b) are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter sequence in CAFs exposed to CoCl2 for 1 h. Interestingly, GPER was required for the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of VEGF, as evidenced knocking-down the expression of GPER (Figure 8c). In parallel, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the recruitment of GPER to the HRE site within the VEGF promoter sequence (Figure 8d). Altogether, these findings suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER leads to the hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence. CAFs treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 were submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (a) or anti-GPER (b) antibodies. For knockdown experiments, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPER (c) or with control shRNA and shHIF-1\u03b1 (d), treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 and then submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (c) or anti-GPER (d) antibodies. The amplified sequences were evaluated by real-time PCR. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle vs CoCl2 treatment.On the basis of these data, we then examined whether conditioned medium from hypoxia-stimulated CAFs could promote in HUVECs the formation of tubule-like structures that represent a useful model system for the evaluation of the neoangiogenesis process. In particular, HUVECs were cultured on GFR-Matrigel\u00ae-coated plates which prevent the formation of capillary-like structures, as previously reported. Notably, HUVECs cultured in normoxic medium from CAFs did not assemble into cord-like structures, while HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs maintained in hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h) displayed a complex ramified network of tubules (Figure 9a). Moreover, in HUVECs cultured with hypoxic medium (2% O2 for 12 h) collected from CAFs, which were previously transfected with a shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER, tube formation was no longer observed (Figure 9b, c). The addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF to the hypoxic medium from GPER-silenced CAFs restored the ability to form tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure 9c). The aforementioned findings were quantified and recapitulated in Additional file 3. Next, we determined that the up-regulation of VEGF protein levels in hypoxic medium from CAFs is no longer evident, knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Additional file 4). Hence, these results clearly suggest that VEGF may be considered as a target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced tube formation. Tube formation was evaluated in HUVECs cultured for 2 h in medium collected from CAFs which were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). To this end, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA (a), shHIF-1\u03b1 (b) or shGPER (c) and exposed to hypoxia, as indicated. Tube formation is rescued in HUVECs treated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and cultured in medium from CAFs transfected with shGPER and cultured under hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). Data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFsIn order to further corroborate the stimulatory role exerted by HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in hypoxic conditions, we turned to a different model system. CoCl2 and low oxygen tension (2% O2) induced CTGF up-regulation at both mRNA (Figure 10a) and protein level (Figure 10b, c) in CAFs. Silencing HIF-1\u03b1 as well as knocking down GPER expression, the up-regulation of CTGF upon CoCl2 was abolished (Figure 10d, e). As a biological counterpart, the migration of CAFs cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2) was prevented, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression and rescued, adding CTGF (Figure 10f). Collectively, our data may suggest that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates different biological outcomes in CAFs exposed to hypoxia.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFs. (a) The mRNA expression of CTGF is induced after the stimulation of CAFs with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as indicated. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. The protein expression of CTGF is induced by 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (b) or low oxygen tension (2% O2, for 4 h) (c). The up-regulation of CTGF protein expression observed upon 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 treatment is abrogated silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER (e) expression. The migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) is prevented knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression. Cell migration is rescued in CAFs transfected with shGPER, exposed to hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) and treated with 100 ng/ml CTGF (f). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.DiscussionIn the present study, we provide novel evidence regarding the regulation of VEGF, which plays a fundamental role in mediating hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In particular, our results demonstrate that a low oxygen tension stimulates through the ERK1/2 transduction pathway the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent expression of GPER, which contributes to the regulation of VEGF in both CAFs and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that following hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter region and cooperatively act as a functional complex for the transcription of VEGF. As a biological counterpart, we evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mediate endothelial tube formation in HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs which were previously exposed to hypoxia. Further corroborating these findings, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER regulates the expression of the migratory factor CTGF, which has been acknowledged as a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.HIF-1 is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and acts as a survival factor in hypoxic tumor environment, mainly activating the transcription of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, oxygen consumption, cell migration and invasion. Besides, hypoxia stimulates through HIF-1 the expression of anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic factors that drastically change the biological properties of tumor cells towards malignant features. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that GPER may be included among the HIF-1 target genes as the up-regulation of GPER induced by hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in breast cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. In particular, GPER-mediated the antiapoptotic effects exerted by estrogens in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the adaptation of cancer cells to a low oxygen environment.GPER may be considered as a predictor of cancer malignancy and aggressiveness considering that its expression has been associated with negative clinical features and poor survival rates in diverse types of tumors. Therefore, huge efforts are currently underway to unravel the mechanisms that rule its regulation and function. Indeed, the development and characterization of drugs that target key players of cancer progression like GPCRs, and particularly GPER, are currently innovative topics under investigation.In this context, estrogenic GPER signaling has been shown to trigger relevant biological effects like proliferation and migration in diverse cancer cells and in CAFs derived from breast tumors. Notably, GPER exhibited the peculiar property to act in CAFs as a transcriptional regulator together with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hence leading to the up-regulation of Cyclin D, which has been largely involved in cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has suggested that CAFs may drive cancer phenotype mainly through a paracrine action exerted by the production of various growth factors and chemokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the stromal contribution to the development of a wide variety of tumors has been supported by animal models of cancer pathogenesis and extensive clinical studies. In this vein, it has been shown that malignant cells recruit into the tumor mass diverse stromal components like CAFs, inflammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate towards cancer progression. In particular, CAFs elicit in breast carcinomas relevant biological activities, including the stimulation of new blood vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth, metastasis and poor prognosis. In this context, our present data add a further mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment may promote angiogenesis, as the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling was shown to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Considering that VEGF is one of the most important factors mediating the complex process of angiogenesis, its action has been widely involved in the development of many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been shown that the ectopic expression of VEGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may promote tumor growth in vivo , whereas the blockade of VEGF has been associated with the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude mice. Thus, given the crucial role exerted by VEGF in tumor development and prognosis, a great deal of interest is currently addressed to a better understanding of its regulation and function. In this regard, VEGF was shown to be regulated by hypoxia mainly through HIF-1\u03b1, which may interact with numerous factors to boost VEGF expression. Further extending the current knowledge on the complex regulation of VEGF, our data suggest that GPER may contribute to the HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional responses in hypoxic tumor microenvironment towards new blood vessel formation. Notably, an increased VEGF production was recently shown to parallel an elevated GPER expression in endometrial cancer patients with low survival rates. These data in combination with our findings may suggest that in estrogen-dependent cancer cells diverse molecular mechanisms could converge on the production of cytokines and growth factors, promoting an enhancement of malignant epithelial growth and invasion through autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Interestingly, we have determined that the up-regulation of VEGF relied on HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling also in HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this transduction mechanism may be implicated in additional pathophysiological conditions, such as the hypoxic myocardium. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective role exerted by GPER in stressful conditions following hypoxia. These data in combination with the results obtained in the present study may indicate that GPER could elicit cardiotropic effects also through its ability to regulate the expression of VEGF, which mainly contributes to adaptive responses following myocardial ischemic injury.As it concerns the signaling cascades activated by hypoxia, we here demonstrate that the ROS-mediated ERK1/2 activation is involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression upon low oxygen tension. In this regard, it should be mentioned that ROS play a relevant role in the biological responses to re-oxygenation; however, decreased oxygen levels may be sufficient to trigger HIF-1-dependent gene expression through the ROS production. In addition, the rapid responses to hypoxia are mediated by multiple transduction pathways activated also upon GPER stimulation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the functional cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER, particularly following both hypoxic and estrogenic stimulations. For instance, estrogens regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression and function in a stressful environment, indicating an intricate cooperation between these two main factors mainly involved in tumor progression. Interestingly, in the current investigation, the biological interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER upon hypoxic conditions was corroborated by the up-regulation of an important migratory stimulator and GPER target gene like CTGF. Accordingly, the migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression, hence confirming their contribution to this relevant cell response.The results obtained in the current study may also disclose a unique ligand-independent action elicited by GPER. This issue could be a further attractive topic which remains to be elucidated in future studies.Altogether, our findings recapitulate in CAFs exposed to hypoxia the engagement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling towards the regulation of pivotal genes involved in angiogenic and metastatic processes. Anyway, further studies are required to better define the role exerted by this transduction pathway in diverse pathophysiological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia through the functional interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.ConclusionsWithin the tumor microenvironment exposed to hypoxia, CAFs have been involved in the generation of new blood vessels which mainly support cancer progression. Our current data highlight the stimulatory role exerted by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the multistep process of tumor neoangiogenesis fostered by CAFs. Considering the crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma, the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway may be pointed out as a further biological target towards innovative treatments in breast cancer.AbbreviationsCAFs: Carcinoma activated fibroblasts; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; DAPI: 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EGM: endothelial growth medium; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAP\u03b1: fibroblast activated protein \u03b1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GPER: G-Protein estrogen receptor; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; HREs: hypoxia-responsive elements; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TCA: trichloroacetic acid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEMDF designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the paper.

Pulmonary metastasis accounts for 90% of the distant metastases and is the main cause of treatment failure and death in patients with OS. The 5-year survival rate has remained at 60-70% among patients with localized tumors, but this is only 20% in patients who had lung metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying OS metastasis and develop effective approaches to suppress lung metastasis.Collagen type VI alpha 1 (COL6A1) belongs to a family of collagens that are widely distributed in several tissues, including the skeletal muscle, skin, lungs, and blood vessels. The COL6A1 gene is located at chromosome 21q22.3 and encodes the alpha 1 chain of type VI collagen, which is a component of microfibrillar structures. The COL6A1 has one N-terminal and two C-terminal von Willebrand factor type A (vWFA) modules. The COL6A1 protein is known to be localized in the extracellular matrix and is involved in cell adhesion and collagen remodeling. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that COL6A1 has diverse biological functions, including cell migration, differentiation, embryonic development, and maintenance of cell stemness. There are a few studies regarding the expression and role of COL6A1 in human malignancies, although high expression of COL6A1 observed in prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer was associated with poor survival outcome. Furthermore, overexpression of COL6A1 enhances pancreatic cancer cell motility and metastasis, while COL6A1 knockdown leads to suppression of this metastatic ability. However, there are no studies regarding the potential role of COL6A1 in the biological processes leading to OS development and progression.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that reside within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are one of the most prominent cell types in the stroma, where they produce large amounts of extracellular matrix molecules, chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors. However, CAFs are very heterogeneous and express different specific markers that can be used for identification. The most used markers for CAFs are \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, fibroblast activation protein, and vimentin. Moreover, CAFs are thought to promote tumor cell growth, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and stemness. In the TME, CAFs build up and remodel the extracellular matrix, which enables the tumor cells to invade through the TME and interact with other cancer cells or stromal cells. This interaction involves the secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and collagen, although the interaction of OS cells with CAFs remains to be studied in details.Exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication, which contain microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs, DNA fragments, and proteins in small vesicular bodies (diameter: 30-100 nm). Exosomes mediate cell-to-cell communication and activate signaling pathways by delivering their contents from donor cells to target cells. Accumulating evidence also suggests that exosomes are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis. Specific exosomes released from CAFs can be internalized by cancer cells and contribute to progression and metastasis by transferring various substances. Thus, exosomes secreted from tumor cells may facilitate tumor invasion and metastasis by converting fibroblasts into CAFs and promoting the development of a TME that supports tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and pre-metastatic niche preparation.The present study revealed that COL6A1 was significantly upregulated in OS tissues and was related to lung metastasis and poor survival among patients with OS. The c-Jun transcription factor bound p300 and increased the enrichment of H3K27ac at the promoter region of the COL6A1 gene, which resulted in the upregulation of COL6A1 in OS tissues. Furthermore, COL6A1 downregulated STAT1 by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which promoted OS metastasis. Moreover, COL6A1 could be packaged into exosomes and transferred from OS cells to fibroblasts, which drive conversion into activated CAFs. The activated CAFs could promote OS cell invasion and migration by secreting TGF-\u03b2. Therefore, we found that COL6A1 promoted OS metastasis by suppressing STAT1 expression and activating CAFs.Materials and MethodsPatient samples and cell linesThis study included 181 randomly selected patients with primary OS who underwent radical resection at the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Medical College and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from 2010 to 2019. None of the patients received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy (Table S1). OS samples (n = 181), non-tumor tissues (n = 44) and lung metastasis tissues (n = 9) were used to analyze COL6A1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. 181 OS cases included tissues with metastatic (n = 29) and without metastatic (n = 152). 98/181 (54%) were male and 83/181 (46%) were female. The median age was 24.5 years (range 8-79 years). 41 pair of case-matched OS and non-tumor tissues were obtained to evaluate COL6A1 expression by western blot and 22 fresh OS tissues and 7 non-tumor tissues were used to analyze COL6A1 expression at mRNA level. Human serum specimens were collected from healthy donors and OS patients before resection in the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. The serum samples included 10 healthy controls, 25 OS patients without lung metastasis, and 5 OS patients suffering lung metastasis. This study was approved by the ethical review committees of the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. All participants involved in our study provided written informed consents.Three human OS cell lines MG63, U2OS and Saos-2 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1\u00d7 antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

GFP-tagged wild type STAT1 (wt), GFP-tagged STAT1 (Y701A), and GFP-tagged STAT1 (S727A) were purchased from Addgene (Watertown, MA, USA).Establishment of stable overexpression or knock-down cell linesFor overexpression of COL6A1 or STAT1 in OS cell lines, the full-length cDNA encoding COL6A1 was subcloned into the pENTER vector (Invitrogen). After virus packaged in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000, COL6A1, STAT1 or mock vectors were transfected into target cell lines. For knockdown of COL6A1 or STAT1, shRNA sequences targeting was cloned into a pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector. ShRNA-containing plasmids were packaged and transfected into target cell lines. Transfected cells used for overexpression or knockdown were selected with puromycin (5 \u00b5g/mL) for 2 weeks.Western blot analysisWestern blot assay was performed as described previously. Briefly, total protein from cells was extracted using RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) supplemented with complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The extracted protein was separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to the PVDF membranes. Western blotting was performed using antibodies against human COL6A1 (Abcam, Milton, Cambridge, UK), N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Vimentin, FAK, Src, p-FAK, p-Src, p-STAT1 (Tyr701), p-STAT1 (Ser727), p-STAT3 (Tyr705), STAT1, STAT3, CD133, ABC2G, SOX2, Nanog, CD63, CD9, TSG101, SOCS5, Flag, GFP, HA, Ubiqution (Ub), GAPDH, p300, c-Jun were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (CST, USA).Immunohistochemistry (IHC)IHC staining was performed using the Envision Labeled Peroxidase System (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) as described previously. IHC staining of COL6A1 and STAT1 was examined by two pathologists. Expression of COL6A1 and STAT1 were analyzed by an individual labeling score considering the proportion of positively stained tumor cells and the intensity of staining. Intensity of stained cells was graded into four levels: 0: negative staining; 1: weak staining; 2: mild staining; and 3: strong staining. The area of staining was evaluated and recorded as a percentage: 0: no staining; 1: positive staining in 1 to 25% of tumor cells; 2: 26% to 50%; 3: 51% to 75%; 4: > 76% of tumor cells. Intensity and fraction of positive cell scores were multiplied and thus the scoring system was defined as low expression for scores of 0-6, and high expression was defined when the score is 8-12.RNA extraction and Quantitative RT-PCRRNA was extracted from the OS cells by RNAeasyTM Plus Animal RNA Isolation Kit with Spin Column (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were performed for three independent experiments and results were normalized to \u03b2-actin. The primer sequences used can be found in the Table S2. The mean\u00b1SD of three independent experiments is shown.RNA sequenceTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and checked using RNase free agarose gel electrophoresis. After total RNA was extracted, eukaryotic mRNA was enriched by Oligo(dT) beads, while prokaryotic mRNA was enriched by removing rRNA by Ribo-ZeroTM Magnetic Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA). Then the enriched mRNA was fragmented into short fragments using fragmentation buffer and reverse transcripted into cDNA with random primers. Second-strand cDNA were synthesized by DNA polymerase I, RNase H, dNTP and buffer. Then the cDNA fragments were purified with QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), end repaired, poly(A) added, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation products were size selected by agarose gel electrophoresis; PCR amplified, and sequenced using Illumina Novaseq 6000 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China).Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assaysChIP assays were performed using an EZ-Magna ChIP kit (Millipore,Billerica, MA, USA). ChIP assays were essentially performed as protocol described with slight modifications: For OS tissues and case matched non-tumor (bone) tissues, weigh fresh frozen tissue and cut it into 1-3 mm3 pieces. Then grind in liquid nitrogen and add 10 mL of 1X PBS. Add formaldehyde until the final concentration is 1%. Rotate for 15-20 min at room temperature. Add 2.5 m Glycine to the final concentration of 0.125 m then rotate 10 mins and centrifuge. Wash with 1X PBS and remove the supernatant. Add 2 mL of frozen 1X PBS. The homogenizer cracked the tissue with the ChIP lysis buffer with protease inhibitor and incubated for 10-15 mins on ice, then centrifuged and flowed, following the manufacturer's protocol. For OS cells MG63 and osteoblast cell line hFOB1.19, 5\u00d7106 cells were fixed with formaldehyde (1% final volume concentration, Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped with the addition of 1/10 volume 1.25 M glycine and the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The sonication step was performed in a Covaris sonicator (5 min, 20 s on, 20 s off), and 200 \u00b5g of the protein-chromatin complex was used in each immunoprecipitation. Antibody-protein complexes were captured with preblocked dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen). ChIP DNA was analyzed by qPCR with SYBR Green (Takara) on an ABI-7500 (Applied Biosystems) using the primers specified in Table S1. The antibodies used are as followed: H3K27ac (CST), p300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and normal mouse IgG (Millipore).Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)Co-IP was performed using indicated antibodies and IgG (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instruction. In brief, cell lysates were incubated with antibody-conjugated beads at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. Then, the beads were washed extensively and boiled in SDS loading buffer. Western blot was used to study the immnuoprecipitated proteins.Cell proliferation assayCell viability was tested with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction. OS cells were trypsinized, counted and then plated at a density of 2\u00d7103 cells per well in 96-well plates. The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. The attached cells were added with CCK8 dilution for 1 h, and then the absorbance of each well of the plates was measured at 450 nm.Flow cytometryThe apoptosis assay was performed after transfection using the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and assessed by flow cytometry. CD133 antibodies were obtained from eBioscience (CA, USA). OS cells were incubated with CD133 antibodies (1:1000) in PBS containing 1% bovine for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. After washing with PBS, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Cyto FLEX, Beckman, Germany). The results were analyzed using Cyt Expert.Transwell assayOS cells were seeded into transwell chambers (Millipore) in triplicate at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells per well in 200 \u00b5L serum-free DMEM medium. Then 750 \u00b5L DMEM containing 10% FBS was added into the lower compartment of the transwell chamber. Cells could migrate for 24 h or invade through the Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for 48 h. Migrated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet, and then counted under a light microscope at a magnification of 200.Colony formation assayAfter COL6A1 or empty vector transfection, cells were added after 500 cells/well were plated in six-well plates and incubated 10 days at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were fixed with 4% buffered formalin for 15 min and then stained with 1% crystal violet (Sigma Aldrich) for 30 min. The plates were gently washed with PBS and dried before microscopic evaluation. Cell clusters with >30 cells were considered as a colony.Cell adhesion assayOS cells were trypsinized, counted and then plated at a density of 3 \u00d7 104 cells per well in 96-well plates coated with collagen I, collagen IV, laminin or fibronectin (10 \u03bcg/mL). The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The attached cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and stained with 1% crystal violet in water for 30 min. After washing with distilled water, the stained cells were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100. The absorbance of each well of the plates was measured at 570 nm.Anoikis AssayTo prevent cell adhesion, tissue culture six-well plates were coated with 200 \u03bcL (6 mg/mL in 95% ethanol) of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA) and left to temperature. 104 Suspended cells were treated and incubated at 37 \u00b0C before harvested several days for cell viability test using MTT assay. Afterwards, 50 mL of 250 mg MTT was supplemented and incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. The precipitate was dissolved in cell lysis buffer (10% sodium dodecylsulfate, 0.01 mol/L HCl), and cell viability was determined by the absorbance value at 570 nm.Collagen contraction assaysA total of 2 \u00d7 105 MRC5 were suspended in 100 \u03bcL DMEM. Then the cell suspension was mixed with 100 \u03bcL of collagen mix containing 68.75 \u00b5L DMEM, 0.72 \u00b5L 1 N NaOH, and 31.25 \u00b5L Type 1 Rat Tail Collagen (Corning, NY, USA), and added to 1 well of 24-well plates and allowed to solidify for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation with media containing tumor-derived exosomes, the gels were photographed at different time points. Image J software was employed to measure gel area and evaluates contraction.Luciferase activity assayTranscription activity was measured by a luciferase reporter gene assay using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Reporter gene expression was measured and quantified by using a dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the Renilla luciferase control. Extracts from each transfection were assayed in triplicate from at least three independent transfection experiments. The results were expressed as means \u00b1 SD.Subcellular fractionation and DNA binding assaysSubcellular fractionation and DNA binding assays were conducted. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein of OS cells was extracted using an NE-PER protein extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For western blot analysis, tubulin and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) were used for the cytoplasmic and nuclear loading control, respectively.Oligonucleotide pull-down assays were performed with an annealed nucleotide comprising the STAT1 consensus site (5\u2032-CATGTTATGCATATTCCTGTAAGTG-3\u2032) and STAT3 consensus site (5'-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3') with a 5-biotin label. Nuclear extracts (50-100 \u03bcg) were incubated for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C with 1 \u03bcg oligonucleotide in binding buffer, and then Sepharose-streptavidin (50 \u03bcL; Sigma) was added for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. After three washes in PBS, the complexes were suspended in SDS sample buffer and processed for western blotting, as described above, and probed with anti-STAT1, STAT3 antibodies (CST).ELISAConditioned media from cancer cells plated with same cell numbers were transfected with COL6A1 or control, harvested, and analyzed using the Human IL-6, IL-8 (Absion, China) and TGF-\u03b2 quantikine ELISA kit (Novus, China), following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the 50 \u03bcL of sample and standard lysate were added to microplate wells respectively. Then 100 \u03bcL of detection reagent was added to each assay well. After incubation for 20 min, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an ELISA microplate reader.Culture medium protein extractionThe indicated OS cells at 80% confluence were incubated in serum-free DMEM for three days. The CM were collected, filtered, and then added 4 volumes of cold acetone. After mix and keep at -20 \u00b0C overnight. Then spin at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and discharge supernatant and retain the pellet. Dry samples under vacuum and resuspend samples in a minimal volume of RIPA buffer. The expression of indicated protein was detected by western blot.Exosome isolation and identificationExosomes were isolated from culture medium by using ExoQuick-TC (SBI, PA, USA). The purified exosomes were resuspended in PBS for functional assays or used for protein detection. The protein concentration of exosomes was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). The size and quality of exosomes was determined using a LM10-HS NanoSlight instrument and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) software and transmission electron microscope (TEM).Exosomes tracingFor exosome-tracing experiments, tumor cells were pre-treated by a PKH67 green Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation with recipient cells that were pre-treated with exosomes labeled with PKH67. Cells were washed thrice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and stained with DAPI for 20 min at RT. Finally, cells were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems AG).Co-culture assayThe co-culture assay was established using transwell membranes (pores 0.4 \u03bcm, Merck Millipore, USA) in a 12-well format. OS cells were pretreated with GW4869 (Selleck, USA; 20 \u03bcM) or DMSO for 24 h in advance. The co-culture was performed for 3-6 days whereas OS (5 \u00d7 104 cells) on the permeable membranes were treated with GW4869 (20 \u03bcM) or DMSO, and then MRC5 cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells at the beginning) below the membranes were ready for further cytological experiments.Animal studyFor in vivo metastasis assays, each experimental group consisted of six 6-week-old male BALB/c-nu/nu mice. Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 107 cells with stably COL6A1 overexpressed or knockdown were suspended in 40 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM for each nude mouse (6 in each group), were injected intravenously through the tail vein into mouse. The mice were killed 8 weeks after injection. Tumor nodules formed on the lung surfaces were macroscopically determined and counted. The lungs were excised and embedded in paraffin. Our protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center.Statistical analysisDifferences among the treatment groups were assessed via ANOVA using statistical software (SPSS, IBM, USA). The significance of differences between groups was estimated by Student's t-test, Wilcoxon test, as appropriate. The survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Two-sided p-values were calculated, and a probability level of 0.05 was chosen for statistical significance. The data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of at least three separate experiments.ResultsCOL6A1 is upregulated in human OS tissues and is related to poor outcomesTo identify genes that might predict OS metastasis, we analyzed three microarray datasets (GSE14827: N = 27, GSE85537: N = 6, GSE37552: N = 4) that included primary OS tissues, lung metastasis tissues, and OS primary and metastasis cell lines. Four of these genes (encoding THY1, COL6A1, ADGRL3, and IGFBP5) were present in all the three datasets (Figure 1A). As COL6A1 was shown to associate with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancer types, we selected it for further analysis. Moreover, the OS metastasis samples had significantly elevated COL6A1 expression (3.53-fold in GSE37552 and 1.56-fold in GSE85537), relative to non-metastasis samples (Figure 1B).Expression of the COL6A1 protein in OS tissues (n = 181) was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, which revealed significantly higher expression in the OS tissues than in non-tumor tissues (n = 44) (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we found that COL6A1 expression was higher in metastatic OS cases (n = 29) than in non-metastatic OS cases (n = 152). The immunohistochemical scores were also higher in the lung metastasis tissues (n = 9) than in primary OS tissues (n = 181) (Figure 1D). Moreover, western blotting revealed significantly higher COL6A1 protein expression in the OS tissues than in case-matched non-tumor tissues (n = 41) (Figure 1E). We also performed qRT-PCR and found that the COL6A1 mRNA expression levels were higher in the OS tissues (n = 22) than in non-tumor tissues (n = 7). The clinical significance of COL6A1 expression was evaluated based on the clinicopathological characteristics of 181 patients with OS (Table 1). The results revealed that COL6A1 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, although COL6A1 expression was not significantly associated with age, sex, tumor location, or distinct metastasis. Clinical follow-up data revealed that high COL6A1 expression was strongly associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.012) (Figure 1G). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses also confirmed that distinct metastasis was an independent predictor of survival among patients with OS (Figure 1H). Taken together, the results indicate that upregulation of COL6A1 was significantly associated with poor outcome in patients with OS.COL6A1 promotes in vitro and in vivo metastasis in OS modelsFurther, we explored the functional role of COL6A1 in the tumorigenesis and/or progression in human OS. Relative to an osteoblast cell line (hFOB1.19), the OS cell lines (U2OS, Saos-2, and MG63) had higher COL6A1 mRNA and protein expression based on the qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence analyses (Figure S1A). The strongest COL6A1 expression was observed in the MG63 cell line, which also exhibited the highest metastatic potential based on the transwell assay than in other cells (Figure S1B). Next, the COL6A1 plasmid and siRNA transfection efficiency was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting (Figure S1C). Without influencing cell proliferation, the expression of COL6A1 significantly increased colony formation, migration capability, and invasion capability, but decreased apoptosis in the OS cells (Figure 2A-C and Figure S1D-G). Anoikis is a special apoptotic process that is caused by a loss of or inappropriate cell adhesion, which leads to tumor recurrence and metastasis. We observed that COL6A1 transfection significantly promoted anoikis resistance under suspension culture conditions, and that COL6A1-knockdown cells were more sensitive to detachment-induced apoptosis than control cells (Figure 2D). Considering that COL6A1 is an important extracellular matrix protein, we used recombinant human COL6A1 (rhCOL6A1) to evaluate the effects of extracellular secreted COL6A1 on OS migration. However, COL6A1 protein expression and OS cell migration were not affected by rhCOL6A1 treatment (Figure S1H-J). These results indicate that intracellular COL6A1, rather than extracellular COL6A1, positively regulated OS cell migration, invasion, and resistance to anoikis.We measured the OS cell-matrix adhesion and observed that COL6A1 overexpression was associated with a significant increase in cell adhesion via collagen I, collagen IV, and fibronectin. In addition, COL6A1 knockdown had the opposite effect (Figure 2E and Figure S2A), which indicated that COL6A1 facilitated OS cell-matrix adhesion. The focal adhesion kinase/Src kinase (FAK/Src) pathway regulates cell-matrix adhesion, which prompted us to evaluate the potential regulation of the FAK/Src pathway by COL6A1 in OS cells. We observed that COL6A1 overexpression markedly increased the phosphorylation levels of FAK and Src, and that shRNA mediated COL6A1 knockdown led to a significant decrease in FAK and Src phosphorylation (Figure S2B). Treatment of OS cells with a Src inhibitor significantly suppressed the effect of COL6A1 overexpression on Src and FAK activation, cell-matrix adhesion, and cell migration (Figure 2F-H). These results indicate that COL6A1 mediated OS cell-matrix adhesion and cell migration via increasing phosphorylation of Src and FAK. Cell lines with stable COL6A1 overexpression or COL6A1 knockdown were used to evaluate the in vivo effects of COL6A1 on metastasis using mouse xenograft models. Figure 2I shows that the COL6A1 group had a remarkably higher average number and size of metastatic pulmonary nodules relative to the control group. These results indicate that COL6A1 promotes OS cell invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo.p300/c-Jun induces COL6A1 upregulation by modulating H3K27 acetylationThe potential mechanisms underlying COL6A1 overexpression in OS were evaluated using the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). Figure S3A shows substantial enrichment of H3K27ac in the promoter region of COL6A1. We also found that expression of COL6A1 and H3K27ac enrichment levels were remarkably increased by treating OS cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate (NaBu) (Figure 3A-B). Moreover, we found greater enrichment of H3K27Ac at the COL6A1 promoter in OS tissues and cells MG63 than in normal tissues and osteoblast cell hFOB1.19 (Figure 3C). These results suggest that histone acetylation/histone deacetylase-mediated histone modification may be an epigenetic mechanism that regulates COL6A1 transcription.To evaluate whether histone acetyltransferase p300 plays a role in the activation of COL6A1 gene transcription, we treated OS cells with two p300 inhibitors (C646 and A485). Figure 3D shows that this treatment decreased the COL6A1 mRNA and protein expressions. Furthermore, p300 overexpression in U2OS cells increased the expressions of COL6A1 mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E). As expected, upregulation of p300 in OS cells increased the enrichment of H3K27ac at the COL6A1 promoter, and p300 inhibition using A485 decreased the enrichment of H3K27ac (Figure 3F and Figure SB). As a transcriptional co-activator, p300 must be recruited to the target promoter by specific transcriptional factors, and the COL6A1 promoter includes two c-Jun binding sites (-180 and-1970 bp). We found that c-Jun increases the expression and transcription activity of COL6A1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S3C). Western blotting revealed strong COL6A1 expression in cell co-transfected with p300 and c-Jun, which was significantly stronger than expression in cells transfected with p300 or c-Jun plasmids alone (Figure 3G). Figure 3H shows the nuclear co-localization of c-Jun and p300. To evaluate whether the two c-Jun-binding sites in the COL6A1 promoter contribute to the c-Jun-mediated activity of p300, we constructed three reporter plasmids with mutation at the -180-c-Jun site, -1970-c-Jun site, and both sites (Figure S3D). As shown in Figure 3I, relative to the wild type cells, all mutations reduced the synergistic action of p300 and c-Jun at the COL6A1 promoter, and the double-mutated plasmid was associated with a significantly decreased synergistic action of p300 and c-Jun. These results indicate that binding of c-Jun with p300 promoted the enrichment of H3K27ac at the COL6A1 promoter, which increased the transcription of COL6A1.COL6A1 promotes OS cell invasion and migration by suppressing STAT1 expression and activationWe performed RNA sequencing to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the COL6A1-overexpressing cells and control cells. A 2-fold screening filter was applied, which identified 71 upregulated genes and 136 downregulated genes in the cells with COL6A1 overexpression. The most differentially expressed genes (DEG) are shown in Figure S4A; six DEGs were validated using qRT-PCR (Figure S4B). Analysis of gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes revealed that the DEGs were related to cell adhesion molecules, Janus kinase (JAK)/ signal transducers and the activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway (Figure 4A). Considering that STAT1 and STAT3 are key regulators in the JAK-STAT pathway, we evaluated whether COL6A1 expression influenced STAT1 and STAT3 expression and activation in OS cells. Figure 4B and C show that STAT1 and p-STAT1 protein and mRNA levels are decreased after COL6A1 transfection, while the STAT3 and p-STAT3 levels are increased. Previous research has indicated that STAT3 is a novel target for treating OS, although the role of STAT1 in OS remains unclear. Thus, we explored the effect of COL6A1 on STAT1 activity in OS. COL6A1 overexpression decreased nuclear translocation, transcriptional activity and DNA binding of STAT1 based on the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction assay, luciferase reporter and biotin pull down assay (Figure 4D-F). Moreover, we found that COL6A1 upregulated STAT3 expression and activation through inhibiting STAT1 expression (Figure S4C-F). These results indicate that COL6A1 suppresses STAT1 expression and activation in OS cells.We confirmed the function of STAT1 in OS cells using gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. Relative to an empty vector, transfection of the STAT1 vector resulted in significant increases in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, as well as decreases in colony formation, cell migration, and cell invasion by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in OS cells (Figure S5A-I). Rescue experiments were also used to determine whether the effect of COL6A1 on metastasis was mediated by repression of STAT1 in OS cells. The results revealed that the positive effects of COL6A1 knockdown on cell migration were significantly impaired by STAT1 depletion. Moreover, transfection of STAT1 significantly decreased the cell migration capability and EMT in cells with COL6A1 overexpression (Figure 4G). Furthermore, we evaluated STAT1 protein expression by western blotting and observed higher expression in the non-tumor tissues than in OS tissues (Figure 4H). Based on immunohistochemistry, we observed that the expression of STAT1 and COL6A1 were inversely related (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.028) (Figure 4I). In vivo, the group with expression of STAT1 plus COL6A1 has less metastasis nodules than COL6A1 group, which suggested that elevated STAT1 expression suppressed the in vivo lung metastasis in COL6A1-overexpressing OS cells (Figure 4J). Taken together, these results indicate that COL6A1 promotes OS cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo by suppressing STAT1 expression and activation.COL6A1 interacts with E3 ligase SOCS5 to promote STAT1 degradationNext, we explored the mechanism by which COL6A1 regulated STAT1 activity in OS cells. Confocal microscopy experiments indicated co-localization COL6A1 and STAT1 in the Saos-2 and U2OS cell lines (Figure 5A). Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that STAT1 interacted with VWFA1 domain of COL6A1 (Figure 5B and Figure S6A). Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation lead to STAT1 downregulation in several cancer types, and western blotting revealed dramatic dose-dependent increase in the STAT1 protein levels after MG132 treatment (Figure S6B). COL6A1-overexpressing cells had significantly shorter STAT1 protein half-lives, and the depletion of COL6A1 expression restored STAT1 protein stability compared with control cells, as detected by cycloheximide chase assay (Figure 5C). These results supported that COL6A1 promoted proteasomal degradation of STAT1. We performed immunoprecipitation and western blotting and identified that COL6A1 expression was associated with increased STAT1 ubiquitination (Figure 5D). However, COL6A1 was pulled-down with and increased ubiquitination of the wild-type STAT1 and STAT1 mutated at two functionally active sites (Y701A and S727A), indicating that COL6A1-mediated degradation of STAT1 was independent of phosphorylation at Y701 or S727 (Figure S6C-D). COL6A1 increased the ubiquitination of STAT1 on the K63-linked ubiquitin chain, but not the K48-linked ubiquitin chain (Figure S6E).We next investigated which E3 ubiquitin ligase mediated the protein degradation of STAT1 induced by COL6A1. Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS5) is predicted with the highest confidence as a primary E3 ligase for STAT1 in UbiBrowser database (Figure S6F). We then confirmed a strong interaction between endogenous STAT1 and SOCS5 after COL6A1 transfection (Figure 5E). Moreover, deletion of the STAT1 SH2 domain abolished the interaction with SOCS5 (Figure S6G). To test whether SOCS5 affects the cellular level of STAT1, we overexpressed wild-type (wt) SOCS5 in U2OS cells and found that the endogenous protein level of STAT1 was sharply reduced. However, ectopic expression of SOCS5R406K, which lacks ubiquitin ligase activity, did not affect the levels of STAT1, indicating that the E3 catalytic activity of SOCS5 was required for STAT1 protein destabilization (Figure 5F). Consistently, the half-life of STAT1 was significantly reduced in SOCS5 overexpression cells (Figure 5G) but not in SOCS5R406K overexpression cells (Figure S6H). These results suggest that SOCS5 E3 ligase destabilizes STAT1 in OS cells. To investigate whether endogenous SOCS5 contributes to the COL6A1-induced protein degradation of STAT1, we transfected U2OS with SOCS5 siRNA. Depletion of SOCS5 resulted in a slight increase in the levels of STAT1, and the effect of SOCS5 was more substantial after COL6A1 transfection (Figure 5H). Furthermore, knockdown of SOCS5 extended the half-life of STAT1, and the effect of SOCS5 was more significant after COL6A1 transfection (Figure 5I and Figure S6I). Consistent with these observations, overexpression of SOCS5, but not SOCS5R406K, significantly increased the ubiquitination of STAT1. Additionally, knockdown of SOCS5 markedly reduced the ubiquitination of STAT1 (Figure 5J). To further understand the molecular basis of how STAT1 is ubiquitinated, we searched for specific sites in STAT1 isoforms that respond to SOCS5 E3 ligase and identified the K592 and K652 sites located in the SH2 domain of STAT1 to possibly affect STAT1 degradation. We generated series mutations in which the two K sites were mutated individually and in combination. As shown in ubiquitination assays, both individual and combination mutants of STAT1 were resistant to ubiquitination by SOCS5 (Figure 5K). Further, the half-lives of STAT1 2KR mutants were significantly extended in U2OS cells transfected with SOCS5 (Figure S6J). Taken together, these results demonstrated that COL6A1 interacted with E3 ligase SOCS5 to promote STAT1 degradation.Exosomal COL6A1 induces cancer-associated fibroblast activation to foster lung metastasisWe previously found that the expression of COL6A1 was positively correlated with \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), an activated CAF biomarker, in mouse lung metastasis tissues detected by IHC (data not shown). Thus, we chose MRC5 cells (human embryonic lung fibroblasts) as a model to explore whether tumor cell derived COL6A1 could promote OS metastasis by activating CAF. The COL6A1 protein was detectable in the culture medium (CM) from COL6A1-transfected cells and control cells, which suggested that both exogenous and endogenous COL6A1 can be secreted into the CM (Figure 6A). The wound healing assay and transwell assay results revealed that CM from the COL6A1-transfected cells (CM/COL6A1) significantly promoted the migration of MRC5 cells relative to CM from control cells (CM/NC) (Figure 6B). Figure S7A shows that MRC5 cells that were exposed to CM/COL6A1 had a higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b2, relative to MRC5 cells exposed to CM/NC. However, COL6A1 expression and MRC5 cell migration was not affected by rhCOL6A1 expression (Figure S7B). These results suggest that intracellular COL6A1, rather than extracellular COL6A1, promotes lung fibroblasts MRC5 cell migration.Thus, we speculated that COL6A1 could be transferred from OS cells to MRC5 cells via exosomes, vital mediators between cancer cells and the stroma to transfer genetic messages. We purified and identified exosomes from the supernatant of OS cell cultures based on electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and immunostaining (Figure S7C). Furthermore, increased COL6A1 protein expression and cell migration ability was observed in the recipient MRC5 cells after treatment using U2OS CM/COL6A1, although an exosome blocker (GW4869) abolished this effect (Figure S7D). These results indicate that the unique COL6A1 content of OS-derived exosomes functions as a migratory regulator in MRC5 cells. The exosome tracing assay showed green (PKH67-labelled OS cell-derived exosomes) and red (Cy3-labeled, COL6A1 plasmid-transfected OS cell-derived exosomes) spots in the recipient MRC5 cells after co-culturing with OS cells (Figure 6C). The expression of COL6A1 was also increased in MRC5 cells following treatment with exosomes derived from COL6A1-expressing tumor cells (EXO/COL6A1) (Figure 6D). Transwell and wound healing assays revealed that a greater number of fibroblasts migrated in the EXO/COL6A1 group than in the EXO/NC group (Figure 6E). Moreover, activated CAFs can enhance matrix adhesions, which results in increased contraction of the collagen gel matrices. Therefore, we assessed the effects of OS cell-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction, which revealed markedly enhanced contraction abilities after treatment with EXO/COL6A1 (vs. EXO/NC, Figure 6F). The MRC5 cells exposed to EXO/COL6A1 showed significantly higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes and enhanced secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b2 based on the qRT-PCR and ELISA results (Figure 6G-H and Figure S7E). As IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 are well-known targets of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), we evaluated NF-kB signaling in the experimental models. The MRC5 cells that had been exposed to CM/COL6A1 had increased NF-kB expression and activation (vs. the CM/NC group, Figure 6I), and similar results were obtained when the MRC5 cells were transfected with COL6A1 or control vectors (Figure S8A-F).Intravenous administration of exosomes from COL6A1-transfected OS cells markedly contributed to the in vivo formation of lung metastasis and CAF enrichment based on the immunohistochemical evaluation of \u03b1-SMA expression (Figure 6J). We then evaluated serum-derived exosomes from OS patients and healthy controls, and revealed that OS patients with lung metastasis from OS had higher serum exosome concentrations and serum-based exosomal expression of COL6A1 than non-metastasis OS patients and the healthy controls (Figure S8G-H). These results suggest that exosomes derived from COL6A1-overexpressing OS cells contributed to fibroblast activation and led to lung metastasis.Activated fibroblasts promote OS metastasis by mediating TGF-\u03b2/COL6A1 signaling pathwayTumor progression is mediated by CAFs secreting multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, we transfected the COL6A1 or control vectors into MRC5 cells and co-cultured them with the OS cell lines (U2OS and Saos-2).Figure S9A-C shows that OS cells co-cultured with COL6A1-overexpressing MRC5 cells (MRC5 COL6A1) exhibited enhanced cell motility, a higher proportion of CD133+ cells, and greater EMT progression, relative to the control cells (MRC5 NC). However, a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (LY2109761) partially reversed these effects in OS cells, which suggests that COL6A1-transfected activated fibroblasts promoted OS cell stemness, EMT, and cell invasion by secreting TGF-\u03b2.As TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway plays an important role in EMT and tumor metastasis, we found that TGF-\u03b2 increased the migration ability of OS cells in a dose-dependent manner and also profoundly induced COL6A1 mRNA and protein expression in OS cell lines (Figure 7A-B and Figure S9D). To confirm that TGF-\u03b2 induced COL6A1 expression through SMAD complex (a major regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling), we depleted SMAD2 levels by siRNA transfection in Saos-2 and U2OS cells. Figure 7C shows that SMAD2 knockdown abolished the TGF-\u03b2-induced COL6A1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in both the cell lines. Moreover, silencing of COL6A1 expression suppressed the OS cell migration ability that was induced by TGF-\u03b2 (Figure 7D). These results indicate that TGF-\u03b2 may be a critical regulator of COL6A1 expression in OS cells. Further, we measured the expression of EMT-related factors in Saos-2 and U2OS cells and found that knockdown of COL6A1 significantly increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin; whereas, overexpression of COL6A1 rescued these expression changes (Figure 7E-F). We examined the effects of COL6A1 silencing on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT markers; the analysis indicated that COL6A1 silencing significantly increased the TGF-\u03b2-induced inhibition of E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression in U2OS cells (Figure 7G). Immunofluorescence further confirmed that ectopic expression of COL6A1 potentiated TGF-\u03b2-induced changes in EMT marker expression (Figure S9E). A previous study indicated that COL6A1 promotes tumor metastasis partially via enhanced TGF-\u03b2 signaling; we also observed that COL6A1 expression increased the expression of TGF-\u03b2 based on the results from western blotting, qRT-PCR, and ELISA (Figure 7H). By ELISA, serum samples from patients with OS had higher TGF-\u03b2 concentrations than samples from healthy controls. Moreover, patients with lung metastasis from OS had higher serum TGF-\u03b2 concentrations than patients with non-metastatic OS (Figure 7I). These results indicate that COL6A1 plays an important role in TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT and highlights a positive feedback loop that activates COL6A1 and TGF-\u03b2 in OS.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that COL6A1 strongly modulates the metastatic phenotypes of OS cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms include suppression of STAT1 expression and activation by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in OS cells. Furthermore, COL6A1 was packaged in exosomes and helped activate CAFs to promote OS metastasis (Figure 7J). We believe that this is the first study to evaluate that COL6A1 acts on intracellular signaling pathway and extracellular fibroblasts to promote OS metastasis.Previous studies have indicated that COL6A1 is upregulated in several malignancies, including glioblastoma and astrocytoma, although they failed to investigate the underlying mechanism(s). The present study revealed that H3K27ac was enriched at the COL6A1 promoter in OS cells. This is important because histone acetylation and deacetylation are elaborately controlled and highly specific regulatory processes that lead to activation and repression, respectively, of some cancer-related genes. For example, histone deacetylation around the NOTCH1 promoter inhibits its protein expression in small cell lung carcinoma. The p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase can also be recruited at the PD-L1 promoter, which leads to increased PD-L1 expression in breast cancer. The results indicate that the c-Jun transcription factor functions synergistically with p300 to activate the COL6A1 promoter, suggesting that histone acetylation modification plays an important role in regulating the transcription and expression of COL6A1.Under physiological conditions, COL6A1 exerts different cytoprotective functions, including inhibition of apoptosis, regulation of cell differentiation, and promotion of cell growth. However, other studies have indicated that COL6A1 can promote metastasis as knockdown of COL6A1 suppressed the metastatic ability of lung cancer and pancreatic cancer by regulating expression of proteins related to EMT.The present study indicated that increased expression of COL6A1 in OS cells significantly promoted cell adhesion, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The gain- and loss-of-function experiments also provided strong evidence that COL6A1 promoted OS cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components (collagen I, collagen IV, and fibronectin) and increased the phosphorylation levels of FAK and Src, which is consistent with the KEGG analysis of RNA-seq results that COL6A1 was closely related with cell adhesion molecular pathway. Furthermore, we found that COL6A1 enhanced anoikis resistance, which is a prerequisite for tumor metastasis. Taken together, these results indicate that COL6A1 plays important roles in OS cell invasion by promoting cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and cell survival after detachment from extracellular matrix.We also explored the downstream molecular mechanisms by which COL6A1 induced metastasis in the OS cells. We determined that the JAK/STAT pathway was involved and that STAT1 was one putative target. The experiments revealed that STAT1 plays a tumor suppressor role in OS, which is consistent with previous reports that showed that the forced expression of STAT1 can repress tumor metastasis in variety of cancer types, such as fibrosarcoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma. We observed that the reintroduction of STAT1 in COL6A1-overexpressing OS cells antagonized the effects of COL6A1 in OS cell invasion and migration. Previous study indicated that proteasomal degradation led to low expression of STAT1 in cancer, consistent with the data that proteasome inhibitors can prolong the activation and increase total expression of STAT1. Moreover, the ubiquitination and degradation of STAT1 could be mediated by several proteins, including E3 ligase, ERK, osteopontin, and SMAD ubiquitination-regulatory factor 1/Smurf1, in human breast cancer cells and murine mammary epithelial tumor cells. The present study revealed that the E3 ligase SOCS5 could bind with COL6A1 to promote the degradation of STAT1 via ubiquitination, which regulated its expression in OS cells. These results suggest that the COL6A1/STAT1 axis plays an important role in OS invasion and migration.CAFs enhance tumor invasion via specific communications with cancer cells. Thus, based on our previous study, we speculated that COL6A1, as an extracellular protein, could have significant effects on the tumor-CAF interaction. We observed that COL6A1 exists in the OS cell culture medium and promotes the migration of lung fibroblasts (MRC5 cells) and increases the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, IL-6, and IL-8, which are biomarkers for CAF activation. However, rhCOL6A1 had no effect on the migration of MRC5 or OS cells, which suggested that COL6A1 could be internalized through some carriers to intracellularly drive the activation of CAFs. Exosomes are also important mediators of cell interaction by which tumor-derived exosomes can drive the activation of normal fibroblasts and differentiation into CAFs, as observed in colon cancer and ovarian cancer models. For example, liver tumor-derived exosomal miR-1247-3p could convert fibroblasts to CAFs in the lung pre-metastatic niche. The present study indicated that COL6A1 was present in OS cell-derived exosomes and helped drive the conversion of fibroblasts into CAFs. As the most abundant cells in the tumor stroma, CAFs enhance the metastasis of the head, neck, and oral cancers. However, it remains unclear how CAFs participate in cancer cells acquiring an aggressive phenotype, as well as the molecular mediators that are involved in these processes. Ren et al. reported that CAF-mediated increased transcription of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells promoted invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b2, which is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment. The present study also revealed that activated CAFs enhanced the invasive potential of OS cells by secreting TGF-\u03b2, which induced COL6A1 expression and the EMT, and ultimately facilitated OS metastasis. All results suggest that exosomal COL6A1 in the extracellular environment may serve as a significant factor that promotes OS metastasis via tumor cell-fibroblast interactions.The present study has a few limitations. First, although we detected exosomal COL6A1 expression in the serum samples of OS patients, more cases would be needed to strengthen the findings. Second, how OS cell-derived exosomes were internalized by OS cells and fibroblasts, or COL6A1 was packaged into exosomes remained to be studied. Third, the expression of COL6A1 in CAFs and normal fibroblasts from patients with OS was not evaluated.ConclusionOur results indicated that COL6A1 was upregulated in OS tissues and related with lung metastasis and poor survival of OS patients. The transcription factor c-Jun bound p300 increased the enrichment of H3K27ac at the promoter region of COL6A1, thus resulting in the upregulation of COL6A1 in OS. Furthermore, COL6A1 promoted OS metastasis by suppressing STAT1 via promoting its ubiquitination proteasome degradation. Moreover, COL6A1 can be packaged as OS cell-derived exosomes, activating CAFs to promote OS metastasis. The activated CAFs could promote OS cell invasion and migration by secreting TGF-\u03b2. In conclusion, we demonstrated that COL6A1 promotes OS metastasis via suppressing STAT1 expression and activating CAF. Our study elucidates a new molecular mechanism underlying OS cells metastasis to lung and the crosstalk between tumor cells and fibroblasts, which contributes to efficient prevention and therapeutic strategies for OS.Supplementary MaterialAbbreviationsCOL6A1Collagen type VI alpha 1CAFsCancer Associated FibroblastsCSCsCancer Stem CellsChIPChromatin ImmunoprecipitationCHXCycloheximideDEGsDifferentially Expressed GenesDMEMDulbecco's Modified Eagle's MediumECMExtracellular matrixEMTEpithelial-Mesenchymal TransitionELISAEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayFBSFetal Bovine SerumFAK/SrcFocal Adhesion Kinase/Src kinaseGOGene ontologyHATHistone AcetylationHDACAistone DeacetylaseIHCImmunohistochemistryILInterleukinJAKJanus KinaseKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesMiRNAmicroRNAsMTT3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromideNF-\u03baBNuclear Factor-\u03baBNCNegative ControlUbUbiqutionOSOsteosarcomarhCOL6A1Recombination Human COL6A1SOCS5Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 5STATSignal Transducers and Activators of TranscriptionTMETumor MicroenvironmentTGF-\u03b2Transforming Growth Factor-\u03b2WTWild typeOsteosarcoma, Chondrosarcoma, and ChordomaPulmonary Metastases from Chondroblastic OsteosarcomaTranslational biology of osteosarcomaCollagen VI at a glancePosition of glycine substitutions in the triple helix of COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 is correlated with severity and mode of inheritance in collagen VI myopathiesCollagen VI disorders: Insights on form and function in the extracellular matrix and beyondExpression of COL6A1 predicts prognosis in cervical cancer patientsCOL6A1 promotes metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancerUpregulation of COL6A1 is predictive of poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patientsTurning foes to friends: targeting cancer-associated fibroblastsA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsCancer-associated fibroblasts as abettors of tumor progression at the crossroads of EMT and therapy resistanceCancer exosomes trigger fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiationThe biology, function, and biomedical applications of exosomesExosomes mediate stromal mobilization of autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling in breast cancer cell migrationExosomes Induce Fibroblast Differentiation into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts through TGFbeta SignalingMesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes in Cancer Progression, Metastasis and Drug Delivery: A Comprehensive ReviewCancer-associated fibroblasts contribute to oral cancer cells proliferation and metastasis via exosome-mediated paracrine miR-34a-5pTumor-derived exosomal miR-1247-3p induces cancer-associated fibroblast activation to foster lung metastasis of liver cancerERK is a negative feedback regulator for IFN-gamma/STAT1 signaling by promoting STAT1 ubiquitinationCancer Stem Cells, Their Microenvironment and AnoikisFAK-Src signalling through paxillin, ERK and MLCK regulates adhesion disassemblySTAT3 inhibitor, cucurbitacin I, is a novel therapeutic agent for osteosarcomaExtracellular vesicles of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts creates a pre-metastatic niche in the lung through activating fibroblastsQuantitative secretome analysis reveals that COL6A1 is a metastasis-associated protein using stacking gel-aided purification combined with iTRAQ labelingCollagen VI ablation retards brain tumor progression due to deficits in assembly of the vascular basal laminaThe Histone Acetylation Modifications of Breast Cancer and their Therapeutic ImplicationsCorrelation between histone acetylation and expression of Notch1 in human lung carcinoma and its possible role in combined small-cell lung carcinomap300/CBP inhibition enhances the efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 blockade treatment in prostate cancerSTAT1 in cancer: friend or foe?ERK and the F-box protein betaTRCP target STAT1 for degradationSmurf1 protein negatively regulates interferon-gamma signaling through promoting STAT1 protein ubiquitination and degradationPhenotypic and functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast within the tumor microenvironmentCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts promote the stemness and chemoresistance of colorectal cancer by transferring exosomal lncRNA H19Cancer-associated Fibroblast-derived IL-6 Promotes Head and Neck Cancer Progression via the Osteopontin-NF-kappa B Signaling PathwayParacrine and epigenetic control of CAF-induced metastasis: the role of HOTAIR stimulated by TGF-ss1 secretion Expression of COL6A1 in OS tissues with its clinical significance.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).  Correlation between CAFs infiltration and immune featuresCorrelation between CAFs and hallmark signaling and immune cells. a-c, Bar plots showing the GSVA scores of cancer hallmark signaling in the high infiltration group compared with the low CAF infiltration group.

Significantly positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue lines, respectively. The color and size of the nodes indicate the type of cells and P values from Cox regression. Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively. Representative image of primary fibroblasts is shown. b, Heatmap showing the top 40 expressed genes upregulated in CAFs. c, Heatmap showing the top 40 secreted proteins identified by label-free mass spectrometry in culture medium derived from CAFs and the corresponding NAFs. d.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

        "content": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.",

        "content": "Normal fibroblasts produce extracellular matrix\u00a0(ECM) components that form the structural framework of tissues. Cancer-associated fibroblasts\u00a0(CAFs) with an activated phenotype mainly contribute to ECM deposition and construction of cancer masses. However, the stroma of breast cancer tissues has been shown to be more complicated, and the mechanisms through which CAFs influence ECM deposition remain elusive. In this study, we found that the activated fibroblast marker \u03b1-smooth muscle actin\u00a0(\u03b1-SMA) was only present in the stroma of breast cancer tissue, and the CAFs isolated from invasive breast cancer sample remained to be activated and proliferative in passages. To further assess the difference between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts\u00a0(NFs), MALDI\u00a0TOF/TOF\u2011MS was used to analyze the secretory proteins of primary CAFs and NFs. In total, 2,903 and 3,023 proteins were identified. Mass spectrum quantitative assay and data analysis for extracellular proteins indicated that the CAFs produce less collagens and matrix-degrading enzymes compared with NFs. This finding was confirmed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, we discovered that reduced collagen deposition was present in the stroma of invasive breast cancer. These studies showed that although CAFs from invasive breast cancer possess an activated phenotype, they secreted less collagen and induced less ECM deposition in cancer stroma. In cancer tissue, the remodeling of stromal structure and tumor microenvironment might, therefore, be attributed to the biological changes in CAFs including their protein expression profile. ",

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

        "title": "Experimental generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

        "content": "Loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is predictive of poor prognosis in breast cancer, but its function has not been established. Our study tested the hypotheses that loss of Cav-1 expression in breast fibroblasts was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, through promotion of breast cancer cell invasion. Cav-1 stromal expression was immunohistochemically assessed in 358 breast cancers. Cav-1 expression in primary breast fibroblasts was analysed by western blot. Modified Boyden chamber assays determined fibroblast ability to promote invasion of breast cancer cells. The impact of siRNA silencing of Cav-1 in fibroblasts was evaluated using invasion assays and 3D co-culture assays. Loss of Cav-1 expression in breast stroma was significantly associated with decreased breast cancer-specific and disease-free survival (p = 0.01). Mean survival was 72 months (Cav-1(+) group) versus 29.5 months (Cav-1(-) group). This was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Cav-1 expression was significantly decreased in CAFs compared to normal fibroblasts (p = 0.01) and was associated with increased invasion-promoting capacity. Cav-1 siRNA-treated fibroblasts promoted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-468 and T47D breast cancer cells from 27% (control) to 67% (p = 0.006) and from 37% to 56%, respectively (p = 0.01). 3D co-cultures of MDA-MB-468 cells with myoepithelial cells led to the formation of organized cohesive structures when cultured with conditioned media from fibroblasts but resulted in a disorganized appearance in the presence of conditioned media from Cav-1 siRNA-treated fibroblasts, accompanied by loss of E-cadherin expression in tumour cells. Our data confirm that loss of stromal Cav-1 in breast cancer predicts poor outcome. At a functional level, Cav-1-deficient CAFs are capable of significantly increasing the invasive capacity of breast cancer cells.",

        "content": "This study investigated the modulation of type I collagen gene expression in normal fibroblasts by breast tumour cells. Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from stages I, II and III breast tumour tissue revealed that collagen mRNA levels were elevated in stage I tumours compared to the adjacent normal breast tissues, whereas they were decreased in stages II and III breast tumours. This aberrant collagen gene expression was confirmed by non-radioactive RNA:RNA in situ hybridization analysis of 30 breast carcinomas which localized the production of type I collagen mRNA to the stromal fibroblasts within the vicinity of the tumour cells. In order to determine whether the tumour cells were directly responsible for this altered collagen production by the adjacent fibroblasts, breast tumour cell lines were co-cultured with normal fibroblasts for in vitro assessment of collagen and steady-state collagen RNA levels. Co-culture of tumour cells and normal fibroblasts in the same dish resulted in down-regulation of collagen mRNA and protein. Treatment of the fibroblasts with tumour-cell conditioned medium also resulted in decreased collagen protein levels but the mRNA levels, however, remained unaltered. These results suggested that the tumour cells either secrete a labile 'factor', or express a cell surface protein requiring direct contact with the fibroblasts, resulting in down-regulation of collagen gene expression. Modulation of the ECM is a common characteristic of invading tumour cells and usually involves increased production of collagenases by the tumour cells or stromal fibroblasts. This study showed that tumour cells were also able to modulate collagen mRNA production by stromal fibroblasts, which may facilitate tumour cell invasion and metastasis.",

However, the selection of genotypes that are more tolerant to salinity will influence on Damask cultivation in salt stress-affected regions. For this purpose, a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replicates was performed under in vitro conditions on four Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl and Kashan) at 5 concentrations of NaCl (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mM), and the physico-chemical traits were measured 14 and 28 days after treatment.The results showed that Atashi genotype with high levels of Chl a, Chl b, total Chl content, carotenoids, relative leaf water content, proline, total soluble protein, TPC, TFC, TAA, and the highest increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as GPX, APX, CAT, SOD, and POD as well as the lowest amount of hydrogen peroxide showed a better protection mechanism against oxidative damage than the other three genotypes (Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl and Kashan) in the 14th and 28th days by maintaining the constructive and induced activities of antioxidant enzymes, it was shown that Bi-Khar genotype had moderate tolerance and Kashan and Chahar-Fasl genotypes had low tolerance to salinity stress. In vitro selection methods can be used effectively for salt tolerant screening of Damask rose genotypes, although the same experiment should be conducted in open filed cultures to verify the in vitro experimental results.IntroductionDamask rose (Rosa damascena) is known as an aromatic plant, and most researchers consider its origin to be Bulgaria, Iran, Turkey and India. Considering the various uses of Damask rose in medicinal products, perfumery and cosmetics, it has caused a lot of attention to develop its cultivation. According to the ability of Damask rose to be somewhat tolerant to environmental stresses it seems that the selection of a more resistant genotypes has a greater advantage for the development of its cultivation in the mentioned regions. Different degrees of resistance to salinity have been seen among rose and pistachio genotypes which depends on various factors, including cultivar, rootstock, irrigation and planting system. Therefore, it is of vital need to screen and choose the salt tolerance genotypes for sustainable agriculture.In recent years, drought stress is going to be widespread through the world and subsequently salinity is un-avoidable phenomenon as a secondary stress, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Iran is one of the countries where major abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity cause yield reduction, loss of soil fertility and impossibility of agriculture in most of its parts. Salinity is the major limiting factors in the soil which effect on plant performance and its chemical constituents. The harmful effects of salinity on plant growth are categorized in four items; (1) osmotic effect, (2) specific ion effects, (3) nutritional imbalance, and (4) production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Salinity caused to increase in the cellular antioxidant pool components such as carotenoids, ascorbate, proline, total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total antioxidant activity (TAA) especially in the tolerant variety of A. tricolor, while the sensitive variety accumulated the proline much more than other variety. Against negative effect of salinity on morphology and physiology of plant, increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POD) activity under salinity have been reported also in plants. It is suggested that the increment of ascorbate and APX is the sign of tolerance in plants under stress. On the other hand, decrease in carbohydrates was expected because of prevention of the Rubisco and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase activities in plants under salinity. Attia et al. concluded that the salt resistance of R. damascena at 100\u00a0mM NaCl was correlated the maintenance of high water and chlorophyll contents, although lipid peroxidation was occurred by increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents in Damask rose at 100\u00a0mM NaCl. It is also demonstrated that treatment of R. rubiginosa with 150\u2013200\u00a0mM NaCl resulted in higher extent of leaf chlorosis compared to lower concentrations (25\u201350\u00a0mM), and it is more tolerant to salinity- induced by NaCl than CaCl2. Our previous study showed that the tolerance threshold of Damask rose \u02bbKashan\u02bc to salinity was 50\u00a0mM (about 6.5 dS m\u22121), although the antioxidant capacity of explants exposed to 100\u00a0mM NaCl was higher than 50\u00a0mM. According to the our previous studies the Damask rose genotypes enriched with antioxidants were screened across to drought stress. Due to the high economic value of the Damask rose as a suitable medicinal plant in dry regions, it is necessary to evaluate some developmental and performance under salinity. In addition, one of the ways to select the genotypes with the best performance under abiotic stresses is to use of the tissue culture, which requires very little space and time. Considering that Iran as the main origin of Damask rose, it is located in the arid belt of the world and had the ancient history of growing the mentioned medicinal and valuable ornamental plant in saline areas, it shows that Damask rose can be an effective option for the development of cultivation in saline areas.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of salinity on some physiological and biochemical traits, under in vitro culture after 14th and 28th days salinity treatment to better elucidate non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidative defense pathways, regarding salt-tolerant by comparing four genotypes of R. damascena.ResultsPhysiological traitsThe effect of sampling time (14th and 28th day) and salinity on (a) RWC and (b) MSI of four Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan). Different letters indicate significant differences according to LSD test at P\u2009<\u20090.05.Salt stress in all Damask rose genotypes caused to a gradual reduction in leaf relative water content (RWC) and membrane stability index (MSI) in a concentration and time-dependent manner up to 100 mM NaCl (Fig.\u00a01a,b) RWC decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in four genotypes under the different salt concentrations (Fig.\u00a01a). At the 14th day, the reduction percentage in RWC in \u2018Atashi\u2019 was less (180%) at 100 mM NaCl, while \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 showed a greater reduction (348%). Significant differences were observed between the 14th and 28th days, \u2018Atashi\u2019 had 244% loss and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had 434% loss in the shoots water content (Fig.\u00a01a). The membrane stability index (MSI) was significantly reduced in the Damask rose genotypes due to salinity stress (Fig.\u00a01b). \u2018Chahr-Fasl\u2019 genotype had the maximum decrease (334 and 264%) while the \u2018Atashi\u2019 genotype had the minimum decrease (260 and 170%) compared to the control shoots (Fig.\u00a01b) and other genotypes on the 14th and 28th days, respectively.Photosynthetic pigmentsThe effect of salt stress\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes on (a) Chl a, (b) sampling time (14th and 28th day)\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) on Chl a, (c) salt stress\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes on Chl b, and (d) sampling time\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes on Chl b.

The least and the highest decrease in Chl a were related to the \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Chahar-Fasal\u2019 with a 170% and 340%, respectively (Fig.\u00a02a) compared to the control explants (Fig.\u00a02a). In the 14th and 28th days, the highest Chl a was observed in the \u2018Atashi\u2019 and the lowest amount in both times was obtained in the \u2018Chahar-Fasal\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 (Fig.\u00a02b). \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 had the lowest decrease up to 7% compared to the other genotypes on the 14th day (Fig.\u00a02b). On the other hand, \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 displayed the lowest Chl b on the 28th day, at sever salinity stress (100 mM NaCl) compared to the control. The highest amount of total Chl (1.441 mg g\u22121 FW) was related to the \u2018Atashi\u2019 in the control shoots while the lowest amount (0.179 mg g\u22121 FW) was related to the 100 mM NaCl and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u02bc (Fig.\u00a02c). In comparison with the control shoots, the \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had the least and maximum decrease by 170% and 460%, respectively. (Fig.\u00a02c). In the 14th and 28th days, the \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had the least total Chl (0.499 and 0.417 mg g\u22121 FW) and the \u2018Atashi\u2019 had the most total Chl (1.383 and 0.912 mg g\u22121 FW) (Fig.\u00a02d). According to the Table 1 \u2018Atashi\u2019 displayed the least decrease, with a reduction of 150% (Table 1) in Chl b compared to the control on 14th day. \u2018Atashi\u2019 had the most CARs content also on 14th day under control condition, while \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 at 100 mM NaCl on the 28th day, had the lowest CARs content.

Furthermore, \u2018Bi-Khar\u02bc and \u2018Kashan\u02bc at 100\u00a0mM NaCl showed the maximum (626%) and the minimum (387%) increment in GPX on the 14th day, respectively compared to the control. At 75\u00a0mM NaCl, \u02bbAtashi\u02bc and \u02bbKashan\u02bc had the greatest (258%) and the lowest (119%) increment on the 28th day (Table 2). The activity of SOD in \u02bbAtashi\u02bc and \u02bbBi-Khar\u02bc showed the greatest and lowest amount (429% and 200%, respectively) in comparison with the control shoots on the 14th day, which were followed up to 204% and 160%, respectively on the 28th day (Table 2). Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in all genotypes was increased at 75 and 50\u00a0mM level of NaCl on the 14th and 28th days, although it was decreased at higher concentrations of NaCl (Table 2). The highest PPO activity was obtained in \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 50\u00a0mM NaCl on the 28th day, while the lowest activity was obtained in the control shoots on the 14th day. Finally, the highest increment was recorded in \u2018Atashi\u2019 (630%), and the lowest was recorded in \u2018Kashan\u2019 (390%) on the 28th day (Table 2). The activity of CAT and APX was increased in all Damask rose genotypes on 14th day and then reduced at higher concentrations of NaCl on 28th day. The most and the least CAT activity was detected in \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 75\u00a0mM NaCl on the 28th day and control treatment, respectively (Table 2). Our findings revealed that the highest increase was noted in \u2018Atashi\u2019 (420%) and the lowest was recorded in \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 (250%) on 14th day (Table 2). The most APX activity was observed in \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 75\u00a0mM NaCl on 28th day, while the least was observed in \u2018Kashan\u2019 under control conditions on 14th day. Our findings showed that the highest and the lowest increase in APX were obtained in \u02bbAtashi\u02bc (470%) and \u2018Kashan\u2019 (330%) on 28th day, respectively (Table 2).The effect of salt stress\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes on (a) POD activity, (b) sampling time (14th and 28th day)\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) on POD activity, and (c) salt stress\u2009\u00d7\u2009sampling time on POD activity. Different letters indicate significant differences according to LSD test at P\u2009<\u20090.05.POD enzyme activity also increased along with increase in the level of NaCl, so that it showed the maximum and minimum value respectively in \u02bbAtashi\u02bc and \u02bbKashan\u02bc at 100\u00a0mM NaCl (Fig.\u00a03a). \u02bbAtashi\u02bc had the most POD activity on both times after treatment, while the least POD activity was related to \u02bbChahar-Fasl\u02bc. (Fig.\u00a03b).

S. O. V. and CV refer to the source of variation and coefficient variation, respectively.The triple interaction between time, genotype, and salinity had a statistically significant (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) impact on TPC and TFC content (Table 3) of Damask rose genotypes. Along with increase in the concentration of NaCl, the level of TPC also increased in all genotypes as the highest TPC was obtained in Atashi genotype under 100mM NaCl on 28th day (Table 3). The lowest TPC content was observed in the control explants of \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019, on 14th day. A marked enhancement of TPC content (324%) belonged to \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 100 mM NaCl on 14th day and the lowest was displayed in \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 (176%) on 28th day (Table 3). In the 14th day up to 100 mM NaCl and in the 28th day up to 75 mM salinity, all of the salt treated Damask rose genotypes showed a substantial increase in their TFC (Table 3). Also, \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 at 100 mM NaCl showed the greatest (270%) and the lowest (387%) increment in TFC on 14th day, respectively compared to the control shoots. On the other hand, under 75 mM NaCl, \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had the greatest (258%) and the lowest (265%) increment in TFC on 28th day (Table 3).Total antioxidant activity (TAA) TAA was significantly affected by time, genotype and salt stress (Table 3). In all four genotypes, an enhancement in TAA was observed by increasing in NaCl concentration compared to the control. The highest TAA was obtained at 100 mM NaCl of the \u2018Atashi\u2019 on 28th day and the lowest was recorded for \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 control shoots on 14th day. The most significant increase in TAA was obtained in \u2018Atashi\u2019 (277%) under the highest concentration of NaCl on 14th day (Table 3).Protein, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen

S. O. V. and CV refer to the source of variation and coefficient variation, respectively.The mean comparison for the interaction and main effects of salinity, time and genotype on protein, proline, H2O2, and MDA is presented in Table 4. Up to 25 mM NaCl, the amount of total soluble protein increased in all genotypes except for \u2018Atashi\u2019. As well as increase in the NaCl concentration, there was a decreasing trend in the amount of total soluble protein in all Damask rose genotypes (Table 4). \u2018Atashi\u02bc had the minimum decrease in total protein up to 39.7% and 60.6% on 14th and 28th days, respectively, while \u2018Chahar-Fasl had the maximum decrease with 230% and 340% on 14th and 28th days, respectively, compared to the other genotypes (Table 4). On 14th and 28th days of the experiment, increasing in the NaCl concentration triggered a substantial increase in the amount of proline in all Damask rose genotypes. \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 had the maximum and minimum proline at 100 mM NaCl, compared to the control on 28th and 14th days, respectively (Table 4). As well as increase in the concentration of NaCl from 0 to 100 mM, the amount of H2O2 increased dramatically in all Damask rose genotypes. At 100 mM NaCl, \u2018Kashan\u2019 showed the maximum H2O2 with 236% and 264% compared to the control conditions on 14th and 28th days, respectively while \u2018Atashi\u2019 showed the minimum increase up to 212% compared to the control Damask explants (Table 4). All of the salt-treated Damask rose genotypes showed a significant increment in their MDA content on 14th and 28th days (Table 4) as \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 and \u2018Atashi\u2019 showed the most (380%) and the least (230%) increment at 100 mM NaCl compared to the normal condition (no salinity) on 28th and 14th days, respectively (Table 4).Multivariate analysis of Damask rose genotypes under NaCl treatment and sampling timeHeat map (a), loading biplot of the evaluated traits (b) and principal component analysis heat map (c) of the enzymatic antioxidants, the physiological and the biochemical changes in Damask rose genotypes. Genotypes under in vitro-induced salt stress condition. Heat map representing of relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI), Chlorophyll a (Chl a), Chlorophyll b (Chl b), Total chlorophyll (Total Chl), Carotenoids (CARs), Proline, Malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Total soluble protein, Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), Catalase (CAT), Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), Total flavonoids content (TFC), Total phenol content (TPC) and Total antioxidant activity (TAA).Heat map analysis based on the response of Damask rose genotypes to salt stress simulated by NaCl applications under in vitro condition revealed that the traits including MDA, H2O2, proline, TAA, and TPC had positive correlation to salt stress tolerance. On the other hand, some traits such as enzymatic antioxidant including POD, SOD, CAT, APX, and PPO along with TFC, photosynthetic pigment, protein, RWC and MSI were also correlated positively (Fig.\u00a04a). Cluster analysis and dendrograms in the heat map (Fig.\u00a04b) revealed three major classes in the assessed traits of the plants under salt stress. Class I contained PPO, Proline, APX, TFC, SOD, GPX, TAA, POD CAT and TPC; class II contained H2O2 and MDA and class III contained MSI, RWC, CARs, Protein, Chl a, Chl b and Total Chl (Fig.\u00a04b). Moreover, biplot of variables confirmed the heat map cluster analysis in which traits classified in three groups (Fig.\u00a04a). In general, cluster analysis of heat maps for interaction between NaCl and sampling time indicated three classes. Class I contained the Damask rose genotypes was treated by NaCl and 14th day after treatment. Class II contained the Damask rose genotypes was treated by NaCl and 28th day. Finally, class III R. damascena genotypes under severe salt stress which was induced by 100\u00a0mM NaCl (Fig.\u00a04a).The principal component analysis (PCA) and the proportion of total variance (Fig.\u00a04c) explained that three PCA were contributing 87.5% of total variation. The first PCA was the most influential with the variance of 57.9% and contained the traits of CARs, TPD, PPO, Proline, SOD, CAT, APX, GPX and POD activity. The second PCA explained 24% of the total variance, and consisted of RWC, MSI, CARs, Protein Chl a, Chl b and total Chl. The third PCA explained 5.6% of the total variance with H2O2 and MDA (Fig.\u00a04c).Comparison of Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) under 100 mM salinity on the 14th day (a) and 28th day (b) after salinity treatment.Difference between Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) under 100 mM salinity on 14th day and 28th day after salinity treatment were illustrated in Fig.\u00a05a,b which is confirmed that Atashi genotype have had better performance than others 28\u00a0days after salinity treatment.DiscussionSignificant difference in Damask rose explants physiological traits such as leaf RWC and MSI was found among the four genotypes in this research (Fig.\u00a01). RWC is undoubtedly one of the first plant traits influenced by salinity stress, because water stress occurs frequently when plants are exposed to high concentrations of salt in soil solution. Our findings revealed that salt stress affected on the water state of Damask rose genotypes, resulting in a decrease in RWC in saline conditions (Fig.\u00a01a). Under control conditions, \u02bbAtashi\u02bc had the maximum leaf RWC (66.52%) (Fig.\u00a01a). RWC decrease has been documented in several melon species, which is consistent with our findings. Stevens et al. previously found that maintaining cell membrane integrity is important in salinity tolerance. MSI was reduced in this research when plants were exposed to salinity stress. Under saline conditions, \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 had the most stable cell membranes (Fig.\u00a01b). Several other researchers have confirmed these findings, which stated that salinity increased cellular electrolyte leakage, so that selecting genotypes with superior leaf MSI may result in improved salinity tolerance in plants.Salinity as well as drought stress, influenced on plant pigmentation as a decrease in the amount of photosynthetic pigments under salt stress is thought to be caused by delay in pigments biosynthesis or broken down quickly. Reduced Chl a and Chl b levels, as well as total Chl content at higher NaCl concentrations, were measured in all Damask rose genotypes shoot (Fig. 2a\u2013d). These findings are consistent with earlier research, which found that salt stress induced by NaCl, caused to decrease in total Chl concentration in Phaseolus vulgaris. Salinity substantially reduced Chl content and photosynthetic efficacy of peppermint. The enhanced activity of photosynthetic enzymes and the breakage of the pigment-protein complex could explain the decrease in Chl under salt stress. According to Khan, salt stress delayed the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. The total carotenoid content of all Damask rose genotypes grown in vitro culture supplemented with 100\u00a0mM NaCl was reduced (Table 1). The findings were consistent with those found in Cornus sericea and melons. Salt stress caused to \u03b2-carotene breakdown, which led to a lower carotenoid concentration. Carotenoids are thylakoid membrane components that absorb and transmit light to Chl, protecting it from photooxidation. As a result, the breakdown of carotenoids may also induce Chl degradation. The breakdown of photosynthetic pigments caused by salt is most likely due to higher toxic ions, increased chlorophyllase enzyme activity, and damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. According to the recent study, a high amount of toxic ions because of the various salts in effluent caused to the loss of photosynthetic pigments in wheat, including Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoids. Given that salinity changed photosynthetic pigment metabolism, it is evident that under abiotic stress, Chl content is tightly controlled.Salt stress can boost the actions of APX, CAT, and GR in P. popularis leaves. The antioxidant enzymes (GPX, SOD, CAT, APX, PPO, and POD) in this study responded differently to salt treatment, exposure duration, and NaCl concentration (Table 2). Our findings indicated that antioxidant enzymes such as GPX, SOD, CAT, APX, and PPO in the leaf stayed active after prolonged activation (14th and 28th days), (Table 2). The activities of SOD, CAT, GPX, and APX in Damask rose explants decreased as well as increased in salinity duration (28th day) at sever salt stress (100 mM NaCl). These findings were in line with those reported for Brassica juncea L. in which antioxidant system activities increased after brief intervals of 30 min to 5 days of NaCl treatment, and for maize seedlings treated for 21 days except for POD activity. Numerous studies have shown that when plants were treated with NaCl, the activities of APX, SOD, CAT, and GR increased compared to control plants. SOD and APX in mustard and maize, and GPX, SOD, and CAT in UCB-1. Under salinity, the transcript levels of the SOD, CAT, and APX genes stress significantly increased. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GPX activity increased in corn under salinity stress. When plants are subjected to salinity stress, ROS accumulation increased, resulting in an imbalance between ROS generation and scavenging, and cellular oxidative damage. Plants have been equipped with an effective scavenging ROS defense system that includes enzymatic (APX, SOD, CAT, GPX, POD) and non-enzymatic (carotenoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanin). Most likely, the levels of APX, GPX, CAT, APX, POD, and SOD in this research increased in order to reduce the amount of ROS generated under salinity stress. An increase in PPO activity is most likely an induced defensive response that delays senescence. The activity of PPO increased in response to salt stress with the highest activity in older leaves (Table 2). As an adaptive approach under stress, this could selectively promote cell death in these tissues, reducing further water loss and allowing limited nutrients to be partitioned to younger tissues. Previous research has shown that polyphenol production is influenced by abiotic variables such as ambient influences. According to Radi et al., salinity-induced changes in plant metabolism could result in an accumulation in various phenolic compounds.Under salt-induced stress, the total phenolic content increased in this research. Our findings revealed that as well as increase in NaCl level on the 14th and 28th days the total phenolic contents were also increased (Table 3). According to earlier study, increase in salt concentration significantly caused to increase in total phenolic contents level. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that salt stress can alter the phenolic molecules of plants, which are sensitive to salt. The synthesis pathway of total phenolic content may be linked to its buildup under salinity stress. The phenylpropanoid pathway is responsible for the production of phenolic compounds in plants, and this pathway can be triggered in saline conditions. Plants produced several hormones under salinity stress conditions, including methyl-jasmonic acid and jasmonic acid, which trigger phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity which is the primary enzyme in phenolic metabolism in plants results in the production of phenolic compounds. In this study, flavonoid content was tested at various salt levels, and along with increase in NaCl concentration, flavonoid content increased on the 14th and 28th days in all Damask rose genotypes (Table 3). Gengmao et al. demonstrated that as well as increase in NaCl concentrations up to 150 mM, flavonoid levels increased in safflower plant. It was also stated that under abiotic stresses, plants boost flavonoid synthesis to protect themselves from unfavorable stress circumstances. Plants use secondary metabolites in reaction to salinity stress to eliminate and cope to the harmful effects of salt stress. Plants use oxidative defense metabolism, compatible solutes, inorganic nutrients, hormonal control, and secondary compounds in reaction to salt stress. Flavonoids are essential secondary metabolites that decrease the negative effects of osmotic stress, such as salinity. Flavonoids accumulate in vacuoles, chloroplasts, and nuclei, and vacuole flavonoids interfere with hydrogen peroxide detoxification. Salt stress effects on plant water status by lowering the osmotic potential of the soil solution. As previously reported, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) system increased with increasing in salinity level. At moderate salinity, a small increase in antioxidant molecules and their activity implies a regulatory response. Significantly greater quantity and activity of these compounds, on the other hand, represent an apparent state of urgency to deal with oxidative stress under high salinity, which is also reflected in a significant growth decrease (Table 3).Lower protein loss in of \u2018Atashi\u2019 may be attributable to its increased tolerance to NaCl stress conditions. Furthermore, these findings showed that extending the time exposure of salinity, reduced the amount of proteins, particularly in \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 (Table 4). Plants have a dual reactivity to protein patterns when exposed to salt. Salt stress decreases overall protein concentration while simultaneously initiating the synthesis of other specialized proteins required for salt tolerance via ABA activation. The increased activity of protease may be responsible for the breakdown of protein content in a saline soil. Degraded proteins may provide a storage form of nitrogen, which is important in osmotic regulation under stress.Proline content of in vitro cultivated Damask rose genotypes increased dramatically with increasing in salinity and time (Table 4). Our findings are consistent with previous studies of figure. Proline performs critical functions such as osmoregulation and lowering the negative effects of ROS during salinity stress. As a result, more proline accumulation in plants can result in greater saline tolerance. Under extreme salt stress, \u2018Atashi\u2019 had the greatest proline concentration in the current research (Table 4).Based on what we found, increase in the level of NaCl causes H2O2 levels to increase in all genotypes on days 14 and 28 after salinity treatment. Several studies have shown that when plants are under stress from salt, the amount of H2O2 in their tissues increases more. Under stress conditions, plants produce ROS, and an excessive buildup of ROS in response to salt stress can cause oxidative stress and severely damage natural metabolism via membrane lipid peroxidation. In this study, salinity increased the MDA level of treated genotypes significantly on 14th and 28th days (Table 4). Increased lipid peroxidation is a frequent sign of salt stress, which is caused by an increase in ROS production. It has been said that increased ROS formation may harm cellular organelles and components such as membrane lipids, whereas genotypes with lower MDA concentration are more resistant to salty conditions. In this aspect, \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 has the lowest MDA content.ConclusionThe change in weather conditions due to global warming and increase in drought has led to an increase in soil salinity. Therefore, it is so important to measure the threshold of tolerance of different Damask roses to salt stress regarding to the way of defense mechanism. According to the results, it is clear that despite the severe stress applied to the Damask rose genotypes, the mechanisms involved in stress tolerance have worked well in these samples and the osmotic and antioxidant protection mechanisms against the death and deterioration of the explants. Although PPO was not activated under more concentrations of NaCl, POD and APX were the most common enzymes which kept their activation in 100\u00a0mM NaCl until 28th day after salinity treatment. Also TPC and TFC was in higher content until 28th day in tolerant Damask rose genotype, while other antioxidative enzymes as well as other osmolytes were up-regulated more at 14th day after salinity treatment. Based on the results we have selected the Atashi\u00a0>\u00a0Bi-Khar\u00a0>\u00a0Kashan\u00a0>\u00a0Chahar-Fasl genotypes as the most tolerant Damask rose under salt stress, respectively. So, it was concluded that Atashi genotype under 100\u00a0mM NaCl, was the most favorable and tolerant genotype with the highest optimal level of antioxidant activity and the accumulation of compatible osmolytes, as well as the high concentration of total soluble protein compared to the other genotypes. In conclusion, in vitro selection methods can be used effectively for salt tolerance screening of Damask rose genotypes, although the same experiment should be done in the field to verify the in vitro experimental results.Materials and methodsPlant materials and culture mediumOne-year branches with active growth of four genotypes of R. damascena including Chahar-fasal, Kashan, Atashi, and Bi-khar were taken from a research farm in Pakdasht, Iran. The plant material and shoots for wild collections were obtained under the supervision and permission of the Maragheh University guidelines and according to the national guidelines and all authors complied with all the local and national guidelines. Damask rose cuttings were washed 20\u00a0min under running tap-water, then they were surface-sterilized in 30% (v/v) NaClO for 20\u00a0min. The branches recut into the one node shoot explants (1.5\u20132\u00a0cm), and placed in the MS free hormone media, for the initial establishment which solidified with 7.5\u00a0g of agar. The pH value was adjusted to 5.7 before autoclaving at 121\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. Five Shoot nodes were cultured, in 150\u00a0mL culture vessels containing 25\u00a0mL of establishment medium as one replication, then kept at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C and 16\u00a0h-photoperiod (light intensity, 8.85 W/m2) and 60\u201370% RH. Following explants were screened every day for fungal or bacterial contamination then any contaminated vessels were removed from the experiment collection. Shoots were repeatedly sub-cultured three times at a constant three-week subculture interval.Proliferation medium and growth of cultureThe basic medium for proliferative media was the same as the MS establishment medium, plus 130\u00a0mg of iron sequester and 332\u00a0mg of CaCl2, as well as 0.36\u00a0mg L\u22121 benzyl adenine (BA) and 0.03\u00a0mg L\u22121 Indole 3-butyric acid (IBA). The pH was then adjusted to 5.7 and sterilized in an autoclave. After sterilization and transfer to the flow-box, 25\u00a0mL of medium was added to each culture vessels to be used for subculture. Finally, five explants were placed in 150\u00a0mL culture vessels containing the proliferation medium as one replication and transferred to the growth chamber to be propagated and then the mentioned propagated shoots have been used.Preparing the treatment medium including NaCl to induced salinityNaCl was added to the culture medium at five levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0mM) to simulate salt stress. Shoot explants with only four young leaves were placed in culture medium, and then five explants were placed in each culture vessel and transferred to the growth chamber and after 14 and 28\u00a0days, the explants were collected and evaluated for physiological, and biochemical traits.Physiological traitsRelative water content (RWC)Fresh leaf samples were weighted to determine fresh weight (FW), and then they were immersed in dH2O at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. After absorption of surface water, they were weighed again for turgid weight (TW). Leaf samples were then dried in the oven at 75 \u00b0C for 48 h and their DW was measured and RWC was calculated according to the Barrs and Weatherley protocol.Membrane stability index (MSI)Membrane stability of Damask rose explants were evaluated by 0.1\u00a0g of leaves. Then similar disks were detached of them. The samples were put in test tubes having 10\u00a0mL of dH2O in two sets. Then the electrical conductivity of the samples were recorded after incubation at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min (C1) and 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min (C2) by means of EC meters (Jenway model, UK) and the protocol of Almeselmani et al..Chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll and carotenoids (CARs)About 0.5\u00a0g of finely mixed of leaves were extracted using 10\u00a0mL of 80% acetone. After 24\u00a0h incubation in dark place chlorophyll was extracted from completely blanched leaves. Then the amount of absorbance of extracted samples was recorded at 649, 665, and 470\u00a0nm by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550, Kyoto, Japan). For evaluating the concentration of chlorophyll, a standard method similar to Arnon, was applied.Biochemical traitsAntioxidative enzymesFresh leaves (1\u00a0g) were homogenized in 5\u00a0mL of 50\u00a0mM\u00a0K\u2013phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), brought to 5\u00a0mM Na\u2013ascorbate and 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA by the addition of concentrated stocks. The homogenate extract was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The supernatant was used for assessment of enzyme activities. Guaiacol Peroxidase (GPX) was evaluated by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 470\u00a0nm (\u03b5\u2009=\u200926.6\u00a0mM\u2009\u22121\u00a0cm\u2009\u22121) during polymerization of guaiacol. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1\u00a0\u00b5mol of tetraguaiacol per min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was assayed according to the protocol of Beauchamp and Fridovich, which is based on prevention of the photochemical reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium. The reactants were then placed under a 20-W fluorescent lamp for 15\u00a0min and the samples in the tubes were covered with a black cloth. At the end of the reaction, the absorbance at 560\u00a0nm was determined. The activity of catalase (CAT) was measured, as previously established by Li et al.. The Damask rose explant leaves (0.5\u00a0g) were grounded in liquid nitrogen and extracted with the following described method: 100\u00a0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) including 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) PVP and 0.1% (v/v) Triton\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. The extraction was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected and applied for evaluating the enzyme activity. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity was done according to the Yoshimura et al. protocol. The reaction solution involved phosphate buffer (250 \u03bcL), 1\u00a0mM ascorbate (250 \u03bcL), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM EDTA (250 \u03bcL), 190 \u03bcL ddH2O, 10\u00a0mM trans oxide (10 \u03bcL) and 50 \u03bcL supernatant. The absorption at 290\u00a0nm for 1\u00a0min determined the enzyme activity. The activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was measured by Nicoli et al. protocol. The enzymatic solution was extracted the same as peroxidase. In this case, a reaction complex was prepared of 100 \u03bcL of enzymatic extraction, 2.5\u00a0mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 200\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.02-M pyrogallol as the enzyme precursor and was recorded at 420\u00a0nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).Total phenol content (TPC)Using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, the total phenolic concentration of Damask explants was determined as Singleton et al. method. The plant extract was combined with 0.5 cc of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, and the mixture was then held at 25 \u00b0C for 8 min. After 8 min, 2 mL of sodium carbonate solution (7.5% concentration) was added to this solution, and its volume was then increased with water to 8 mL. After two hours, the total phenolic concentration was determined using a 725 nm wavelength. A calibration curve was created using gallic acid as the reference. The amount of mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of sample was used to indicate the overall phenolic content.Total flavonoid content (TFC)Using quercetin as a reference standard, the total flavonoid was measured using the aluminum chloride technique. To accomplish this, 1 mL of quercetin extract or standard solution (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121) was added to a 10 mL volumetric flask containing 4 mL of purified water. After 5 min, 0.30 mL of 5% NaNO2 was added to the flask, followed by 0.3 ml of 10% AlCl3. After 5 min, 2 mL of 1 M NaOH was added, and the amount was increased to 10 mL with dH2O. The overall flavonoid concentration was determined at 510 nm. Total flavonoid amounts were recorded as mg quercetin equivalent (mg QE 100 g\u22121 FW).Total antioxidant activity (TAA)The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique was used to calculate TAA. 1 g of the fresh leaf samples was centrifuged at 21,913 g for 15 min after being separated with 2 mL of methanol at a concentration of 80%. After that, 100 \u00b5L of the extract was combined with 180 \u00b5L of DPPH (0.1 M), the mixture was left to sit in the dark for 30 min, and then a UV spectrophotometer was used to read the absorbance at 517 nm. The TAA was determined by applying the following equation:ProteinProtein content was assayed following the Bradford method, which was calibrated with the standard bovine serum albumin curve. So, 100\u00a0mg of the treated explants were placed in a test tube with 2\u00a0mL of 50\u00a0mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The solution was centrifuged at 7000\u201312,000\u00a0rpm. Then, the supernatant was taken and centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were prepared with 1:100 dilution ratios and read at 595\u00a0nm.ProlineProline content was evaluated by homogenizing 0.2\u00a0g of leaf fresh weight in 2\u00a0mL of 3% aqueous sulfosalicylic acid and then centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min. Then, the pellet was washed with 3% aqueous sulfosalicylic acid twice. The supernatant was pooled, and the amount of proline was evaluated using ninhydrin reagent and toluene extraction.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)Explants H2O2 content was determined according to the Liu et al. protocol. So, 0.5\u00a0g of leaf tissue was grounded with potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 6.8), and then centrifuged at 7000\u00a0rpm for 25\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. A 100-\u00b5L aliquot of the supernatant was added to 1\u00a0mL of Xylenol solution. The solution was then completely mixed and left to rest for 30\u00a0min and the extract absorption was read by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at 560\u00a0nm.Malondialdehyde (MDA)MDA content was determined as 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive metabolites. So, 1.5 mL of the leaf extracts were homogenized in 2.5 mL of 5% TBA made in 5% Trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was warmed at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min and then cooled on ice quickly and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Then the absorbance of supernatant was read at 532 nm. MDA content was calculated as in the below equation:Statistical analysisThe factorial experiment was carried out based on a completely randomized design with 3 replications. Data were statistically analyzed by MSTAT-C ver 2.1 software and means were separated using the Fischer\u2019s protected least significant difference (LSD) test at p\u2009=\u20090.05.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "title": "Different mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling by fibroblasts in response to human mammary neoplastic cells.",
        "content": "Human breast tumors are often associated with a fibrotic reaction termed desmoplasia. Tumor cells may indirectly modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by influencing fibroblast properties. They may also directly interact with collagen fibrils leading to retraction of the matrix. We have studied in vitro the influence of various human mammary tumor cells on the proliferation rate of normal human fibroblasts and on their level of collagen synthesis, as well as their release of collagenase activity. Interactions between neoplastic cells and collagen matrix were investigated by incorporation of tumor cells in collagen gels (lattices) and measurement of their retraction. All cells tested (HBL100, SW613, SA52, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, MCF7/6, MCF7 ras, BT20 and T47D) were able to modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by one or several of the mechanisms investigated. Our results also demonstrate an opposite regulation of collagen and collagenase production. The effects on the collagen metabolism and on fibroblast proliferation are probably mediated by soluble cytokines since they are reproduced by incubating the fibroblasts in the presence of medium conditioned by tumor cells. The desmoplastic reaction may thus result from different mechanisms dependent upon tumor cell types.",

Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Stroma is composed of vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, and various types of infiltrating immune cells that might interact with each other and tumor cells. In most solid tumors, including breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are predominant cellular elements of the stroma. CAFs constitute a heterogeneous population. Multiple CAF subtypes with separate molecular profiles and different impact on tumor outgrowth have been identified in various types of cancer.Differential expression of markers such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), vimentin (VIM), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is characteristic for CAFs. Nevertheless, these markers are far from being comprehensive or exclusively expressed by these subtypes of cells. Therefore, spindle-shape cell morphology is still a commonly used way to identify CAFs within the tumor stroma. CAFs were shown to promote cancer metastasis, as well as affect angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance via synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and production of growth factors. Thus, CAF-targeting treatment aimed at modifying their number, subtype, or features is a plausible strategy of improving patients\u2019 outcome in the future.Several studies have shown the significance of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in development and progression of different solid tumors. It was demonstrated that stromal expression of \u03b1-SMA correlate with a high number of lymph node metastases and worse clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs also enhanced angiogenesis and influenced tumor growth in\u00a0vivo, and correlated with higher frequency of cancer stem cells. Of note, depletion of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in pancreatic cancer suppressed immune surveillance by increasing CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pancreatic cancer.Here, we aimed to better understand the role of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in BC, with special interest in their impact on tumor growth and dissemination among molecular subtypes. We studied in detail CAF heterogeneity in luminal breast cancer (lumBC) at both the molecular and functional level. Using primary CAFs derived from tumor tissue of patients with lumBC, we demonstrated how heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs might determine tumor growth.MethodsPatientsPrimary tumors of 108 patients with breast cancer (inclusion criteria: nonlobular histology, stage I\u2013III) treated in the University Clinical Centre in Gda\u0144sk, Poland (2011\u20132013), were investigated and described previously. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017), and informed consent was collected from all participants.ImmunohistochemistryPreparation of tissue microarrays (TMA) containing primary breast cancer tissues and staining for ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 were performed as previously described. \u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and EpCAM (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone Ber-EP4, Dako Agilent) were stained and detected with EnVision FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL and OPN staining were performed manually using SNAIL mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 2G11, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA, dilution 1:100) and OPN rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution 1:1600) for 60\u00a0min at room temperature.For \u03b1-SMA, EpCAM, and SNAIL, staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) and percentage (0\u2013100%) of the stained stromal (\u03b1-SMA) or tumor cells (EpCAM, SNAIL) in the total number of stromal or tumor cells, respectively, were determined; index score was calculated as the percentage of positive cells multiplied by intensity, resulting in a score 0\u2013300. For OPN, only the intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) of staining in stroma cells was determined. The overall score corresponding to one patient was established. \u03b1-SMA high status was conferred to samples with index score higher than the upper quartile (Q3) of the whole group.Clinical data analysisKaplan\u2013Meier survival curves presenting overall survival (OS) in patients with low versus high \u03b1-SMA were compared using log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The chi-squared test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine the distribution of \u03b1-SMA protein status among clinicopathological features (stage, grade, lymph node status). Differences in protein levels between groups were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U test. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. All the analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 licensed for the University of Gda\u0144sk.Isolation of CAFs from breast cancerCAFs were isolated from tumor samples of four patients with lumBC (CAF2, CAF3, and CAF4 were isolated from patients with luminal B breast cancer, whereas CAF1 from luminal A) obtained from the Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk (2017\u20132018) after patients\u2019 written informed consent. Each sample (1\u20133\u00a0cm) was collected by an experienced surgeon in aseptic conditions and transferred into DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, GE Healthcare) and antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Tissue sections were stored in 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C and transferred to the Laboratory of Translational Oncology where further processing started no later than 4\u00a0h after resection. Tissue sections were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, minced, and digested enzymatically in 0.35\u00a0mg/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.35\u00a0mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) solution in 1\u00d7 PBS for 1\u00a0h with rotation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Disintegrated tissues were centrifuged at 400g for 5\u00a0min, and the pellet was transferred to a cell culture dish. CAFs were separated using serial trypsinization method. After two to three passages, CAFs were controlled for spindle-shape morphology and presence of CAFs markers VIM and \u03b1-SMA, and absence of tumor marker E-cadherin (E-cad).Cell culturePrimary CAFs were cultured in DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, GE Healthcare) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2. MCF7 (HTB-22), T47D (CRL-2865), and BJ (CRL-2522) cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For all cell lines, the same batch of FBS was used. Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cultures of isolated CAFs and fibroblast cell line, BJ. When cells reached 80% confluency, the medium was changed, and conditioned medium was collected after 72\u00a0h.CAF characterizationImmunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on sterilized cover glass and after 24\u00a0h were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol\u2013acetone mix for 15\u00a0min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent) and incubated with cells for 30\u00a0min. Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:1000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA, dilution 1:2000) antibody was used for CAF characterization. As secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 594 and anti-mouse IgG DyLight 488 were used (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; dilution 1:2000). Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).Western blotCell lysate was prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich), then protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated using 12% polyacrylamide TGX gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad). Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:2000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, dilution 1:500) antibodies were used for detection. Appropriate, secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies were used (Sigma Aldrich, dilution 1:100,000).ELISAOsteopontin concentration (ng/ml) in CAFs and BJ-CM was evaluated using human osteopontin (OPN) Quantikine ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Concentration was quantified by measuring the absorption at 450\u00a0nm with a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, USA).3D culture in MatrigelLumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D were used to analyze influence of CAFs and BJ-CM on colony growth in 3D culture (Corning Matrigel). A total of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 tumor cells resuspended in DMEM were mixed with Matrigel 1:1 and placed into 12-well tissue culture plates. Three-dimensional cultures were then covered with CM from CAFs, BJ, and DMEM as a control, exchanged every third day. For experiments aiming at OPN neutralization, OPN-neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) diluted 3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml was used. Tumor-cell colony growth was quantified by measuring the area of at least 40 colonies using Olympus IX83 microscope (10\u00d7 magnification) and ImageJ software. Data were presented as mean relative to DMEM\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments.

Analysis of RNA extracted from clinical samples was processed as described. NanoString data processingThe CAFs and clinical samples RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. Data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls included in the assay and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes, 18 (SD range 2.9\u201366.9 counts) and 4 (SD range 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) in the CAFs and clinical samples datasets, respectively. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples\u2009<\u20094 for CAFs dataset and\u2009<\u20096 for FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 320 and 584 transcripts in CAFs and FFPE dataset, respectively. Genes differentiating between \u03b1-SMAhigh and \u03b1-SMAlow samples were selected on the basis of log2 fold change (log2FC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in compared groups. Genes with log2FC\u2009>\u20091 were considered upregulated; genes with log2FC\u2009<\u2009\u22121 were considered downregulated in the \u03b1-SMAhigh group.Results\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs are associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in patients with lumBC\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs correlate with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in lumBC.

Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied\u03b1-SMA was evaluated immunohistochemically in fibroblast-like stromal cells of 108 nonmetastatic primary breast tumors (Fig.\u00a01A). Staining was informative for 106 tumors, all of which showed expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs; importantly, there were considerable differences in the percentage of positive cells (5\u201390% cells of fibroblast-like morphology) and staining intensity (moderate in 31.7%, high in 68.3% of samples; no weak staining was observed).For further analysis, patients were divided into two groups, \u03b1-SMAlow (n\u2009=\u200993) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (n\u2009=\u200913), according to the upper quartile of the \u03b1-SMA staining index (equal 240). The distribution of \u03b1-SMA status in CAFs (low versus high) was compared with clinicopathological data, including dissemination status, and molecular data. There was no correlation between \u03b1-SMA level and stage, grade, lymph node status, or circulating tumor cell (CTC) presence and phenotype (Additional file 1: Table S1) in the whole analyzed cohort.Interestingly, only in the lumBC group, patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs had significantly poorer overall survival rate (p\u2009=\u20090.019, log-rank; Fig.\u00a01B). However, no further correlations with clinicopathological data or dissemination status were found in this subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S2). In terms of molecular markers evaluated immunohistochemically, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated positively with SNAIL (p\u2009=\u20090.034) and EpCAM (p\u2009=\u20090.016) protein levels (Fig.\u00a01C), pointing to more aggressive phenotype, while no correlation was observed for other previously characterized proteins, i.e., SLUG, CXCR4, and TWIST (data not shown).\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs increase outgrowth of breast cancer cell linesCharacterization of CAFs isolated from patients with BC.

Unpaired Student\u2019s t-test test was applied, ***p\u2009<\u20090.0001 calculated versus control (DMEM)To confirm adverse effect of \u03b1-SMA CAFs on lumBC, CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094) were isolated from primary lumBC tissue specimens and tested on their impact on breast cancer cell lines in\u00a0vitro. After three passages, isolated CAFs were analyzed for the presence of CAF- and tumor-related markers by immunofluorescent staining and western blot along with BJ normal fibroblasts and MCF7 cell line serving as controls. All obtained CAF cell lines stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-cad and presented spindle-shape morphology typical for fibroblasts (Additional file 2: Fig. S1A, B). On the basis of the \u03b1-SMA immunofluorescence staining, CAF cell lines were classified as \u03b1-SMAhigh (CAF3 and CAF4), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200990%), or \u03b1-SMAlow (CAF1 and CAF2), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-negative cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200980%) (Fig.\u00a02A).CM collected from the established CAFs was applied to lumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D in 3D Matrigel assay. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs significantly increased MCF7 cells colonies growth in Matrigel (colony area fold change compared with control equaled 2.16 for \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs versus 4.16 for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, p\u2009=\u20090.0001) (Fig.\u00a02B, C). Similar observations were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).As these results suggested that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM promote cancer cell proliferation, we analyzed phosphorylation of two nodal proteins governing pathways activating cell proliferation, AKT and ERK. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression and phosphorylation of those proteins when MCF7 cells were cultured in 2D and treated with CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh or \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs (data not shown).Since in clinical material \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated with higher expression of SNAIL and EpCAM, we performed qPCR expression analysis of these genes in lumBC cell lines treated with CAFs CM. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells (data not shown).Osteopontin is expressed and secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-secreted osteopontin increases tumor growth.

G Ki67 percentage in patients with different OPN staining intensity\u2014negative to moderate (neg-to-mod) and strong, evaluated immunohistochemically. Mann\u2013Whitney U test was appliedTo identify the potential mechanism accounting for promotion of tumor growth by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, multigene expression analysis of four isolated CAF cell lines (two \u03b1-SMAhigh versus two \u03b1-SMAlow) was performed using nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString). Differential gene expression analysis identified 29 genes that were upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091, i.e., ITGB2, TNFSF4, CXCL6, VCAM1, and OPN) in \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs. They are, e.g., linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, as revealed by Gene Ontology analysis. In turn, downregulation was noted for 25 genes (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121, i.e., NFATC2, MASP1, KIT, IL17RB, and CXCL14) involved in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a03A, Additional file 4: Table S3).Then we examined whether the same differences in genes expression were observed in clinical tissue samples from patients with \u03b1-SMAlow versus \u03b1-SMAhigh lumBC. To highlight the most significant differences between those two groups, scores lower than the lower quartile (Q1) of index score were considered as \u03b1-SMAlow, whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh status was claimed for tissues with scores above the upper quartile (Q3). Only one gene, OPN, was significantly upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091), and five genes, HLA-DPB1, MS4A1, IL6, CMA1, and REL, were downregulated (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121) in patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh (Fig.\u00a03B, Additional file 4: Table S4). Here no interactions were revealed.Interestingly, OPN was the only gene demonstrating upregulation both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor samples of lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs. Consequently, we assessed the secretion of OPN by CAFs in\u00a0vitro. ELISA assay indeed revealed significantly higher level of OPN protein in the CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs (FC 4; p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03C).In accordance with this observation, when analyzed immunohistochemically in the lumBC tissue material, OPN protein was present in CAF cytoplasm and their surrounding in 51% of samples, mostly scored as weak\u20141 (41.8%), moderate\u20142 (38.1%), and strong\u20143 (20.1%) staining (Fig.\u00a03D). Strong OPN staining was observed in 20% (21/108) of \u03b1-SMAhigh samples when analyzed in individual tumor fragments. OPN expression was also noted in cancer cells, as cytoplasmic or nuclear staining (in 30% and 19% of lumBC samples, respectively). Although in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis OPN-positive fibroblasts were reported to accumulate in perivascular spaces, such pattern was not observed in the analyzed breast tumors.OPN secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induces lumBC cell colony growthTo further assess the functional significance of CAFs-delivered OPN in lumBC, we performed 3D Matrigel assay. MCF7 and T47D cells were cultured in Matrigel and incubated with different CAF- or BJ-derived CM supplemented or not with OPN-neutralizing antibodies. We observed that addition of OPN-neutralizing antibody decreased colony growth of MCF7 in Matrigel only in cells treated with CM derived from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (colony area fold change compared with control 4.16 for CAFs CM without OPN-neutralizing antibodies versus 2.87 for CM CAFs with OPN-neutralizing antibodies, p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03E, F). In case of CM from \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs and BJ cell line, the area of colonies remained unchanged (Fig.\u00a03E, F). Similar results were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). In accordance with this observation, OPN strong CAF-associated staining correlated positively with the higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells assessed immunohistochemically in clinical samples (lumBC, p\u2009=\u20090.012, Fig.\u00a03G).DiscussionTME and its components such as CAFs play an important role in breast cancer progression. In this study, CAFs were classified according to the presence of \u03b1-SMA protein, and their impact on lumBC was investigated in the context of this marker both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. We showed for the first time that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs might stimulate growth of lumBC cancer cells by secreting OPN.We demonstrated heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in intratumoral CAFs in primary breast cancers. We found that high level of this marker in CAFs was associated with poor prognosis in patients with lumBC. Even though there are studies that link \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs with worse clinical outcome in breast cancer or specifically in TNBC subtype, we report this correlation in lumBC for the first time.\u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs could potentially influence patients\u2019 outcome by induction or regulation of more aggressive phenotype of cancer cells (characterized, e.g., by increased proliferation, stemness, or epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, EMT). In line, CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induced the outgrowth of lumBC cell lines in\u00a0vitro in 3D cultures. However, no induction of phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, proteins involved in cell proliferation, was observed in MCF7 cell line when \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM was used. This could mean that another signaling pathway was involved or \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u2019 positive effect on cancer cell growth occurs only in 3D cultures that more accurately reflect the conditions of tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. In our cohort of patients with lumBC, significantly higher level of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and SNAIL were found in \u03b1-SMAhigh tumors. In breast cancer, EpCAM is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in the luminal and basal-like molecular subtypes. There are limited studies correlating CAFs with EpCAM, yet Eberlein et\u00a0al. demonstrated that tumor cells (non-small-cell lung cancer) with high expression of EpCAM activate CAF-like phenotype in normal fibroblasts through avb6/TGF\u03b2 signaling. Thus, potential interaction between EpCAM-positive breast cancer cells and \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs should be investigated in the future. In case of SNAIL, this transcriptional factor is essential for EMT and induces tumor cell invasion. It has been reported that SNAIL level is upregulated in tumor cells by CAFs in breast cancer. Interestingly, EpCAM could also contribute to the TGF\u2010\u03b21-induced EMT in lumBC cell line, MCF-7. Thus, in our study, elevated EpCAM and SNAIL in tumor cells of patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may possibly induce EMT, resulting in increased motility of those cells and giving rationale for worse clinical outcome of those patients. Nevertheless, we did not confirm induction of EMT by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs in\u00a0vitro (data not shown). CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells. Such results may be due to performing experiments in 2D culture or EMT induction by those CAFs not being dependent on secretome but rather dependent on direct contact of interacting cells.To dissect putative factors accounting for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-mediated induction of lumBC cell outgrowth and worse prognosis, we analyzed their transcriptome both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. Gene expression revealed that genes upregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (i.e., IL6, IL1B, ITGB2, ICAM1) were linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, which was previously described by our team as EMT-promoting mechanism in breast cancers. In turn, genes downregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh isolated CAFs (e.g., CD40, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF1B, PSMB9) were implicated in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway. Interestingly, only OPN was upregulated both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor tissue samples from lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs.OPN is a secreted, integrin-binding phosphoprotein involved in carcinogenesis. Of note, most studies report on tumor-derived OPN, and little is known about OPN secreted by CAFs. OPN secreted by tumor cells induced expression of CAF-associated markers (\u03b1-SMA and VIM) in mesenchymal stromal cells through upregulation of TGF-\u03b21. It also plays a key role in reprogramming normal mammary fibroblasts to proinflammatory, tumor-promoting CAFs. In breast cancer, elevated expression of OPN was firstly identified in stroma from patients with poor outcome and in CAFs from MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse model. We observed positive OPN staining in cancer cell cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly OPN was present in CAF cytoplasm and surroundings. Here we showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-derived OPN enhances tumor growth, and this process may be inhibited by OPN-neutralizing antibodies. In our clinical samples, CAF-associated OPN (i.e., OPN found in cytoplasm and/or in surrounding of CAFs) correlated also with the higher percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells, which would stay in accordance with lumBC cell outgrowth depending on \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs-derived OPN-induced tumor outgrowth. One of the previously proposed mechanisms of how stroma-derived OPN impacts cell proliferation and survival was involvement of CD44 and activation of MAPK cascade. Whether the regulation of OPN in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs is through one of the known pathways has yet to be determined.ConclusionsWe showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlate with worse prognosis in lumBC and might be associated with more aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells (e.g., EMT-related phenotype and/or increased proliferation). OPN secretion might be one of the mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon. However, the other mechanisms accounting for adverse impact of \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs on lumBC merit further investigation.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblasts\u03b1-SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinlumBCLuminal breast cancerCMConditioned mediumOPNOsteopontinBCBreast cancerTMETumor microenvironmentFAPFibroblast activation proteinVIMVimentinFSP1Fibroblast-specific protein 1PDGFRPlatelet-derived growth factor receptorECMExtracellular matrixEpCAMEpithelial cell adhesion moleculePublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsConceptualization, A.M., N.B.-K., and A.J.Z.; methodology, A.M., A.N., M.P., M.N., and N.B.-K.; formal analysis, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; investigation, A.M., A.N., M.P., and J.S.; resources, J.S., J.Z., A.M., and A.J.Z.; data curation, A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.M. and N.B.-K.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; visualization, A.M. and J.Sz; supervision, N.B.-K. and A.J.Z.; project administration, A.J.Z.; funding acquisition, A.J.Z.

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

MiR-26b in breast CAFs is a potent regulator of cancer behaviour in oestrogen receptor-positive cancers, and we have identified key genes and molecular pathways that act downstream of miR-26b in CAFs. \u00a9 2013 The Authors.

It is well established that tumour stroma plays critical roles in controlling breast cancer epithelial cell behaviour, and therefore in defining cancer outcomes. Tumour stroma includes fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, adipocytes, and blood and lymph vessels, but the fibroblasts are typically most abundant and have consequently attracted most attention. Gene expression profiles of these carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) differ substantially from their normal tissue counterparts, although considerable heterogeneity is evident within CAF populations. Studies have identified specific molecules, such as transforming growth factor \u03b2, hepatocyte growth factor, stromal cell-derived factor-1 and phosphatase and tensin homologue, that are expressed by CAFs and regulate carcinoma cell behaviour, typically leading to enhanced tumourigenicity. Studies have also identified gene regulatory events that are responsible for the deregulation of such molecules in CAFs, including changes in promoter methylation, the activity of key transcription factors, and even\u2014controversially\u2014somatic mutations in critical signalling molecules. However, the contributions of microRNAs (miRNAs) to gene deregulation in CAFs are virtually unknown.MiRNAs are a class of more than 1000 non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of up to 60% of genes. They act by binding to mRNAs, usually within 3\u2032 untranslated regions, causing post-transcriptional down-regulation of protein expression by translational repression and/or mRNA destabilization. Many studies have demonstrated deregulation of specific miRNAs in breast cancer and the potential functional consequences within epithelial cancer cells. Thus, specific miRNAs can themselves be regarded as \u2018tumour suppressors\u2019 or \u2018oncogenes\u2019. Examples include miR-10a, miR-373, and miR-21, which act as regulators of growth, invasion, and metastasis. Interestingly, there is some evidence that miR-21, which is up-regulated in breast cancers and was assumed to be functional within epithelial cells, is in fact predominantly expressed in fibroblasts. Very recently, attention has been given to miRNA roles in the fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, with the first report profiling miRNA expression differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs). We examined these differences in great detail and investigated the functional impacts on CAFs of the most consistently deregulated miRNA that we identified, miR-26b.Materials and methodsEthics, tissue, and laser micro-dissection (LMD)Ethical approval was obtained (Leeds East REC 06/Q1206/180). LMD was performed using a Zeiss/PALM Microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) from formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue as described in the Supplementary materials and methods. CAFs were defined as fibroblasts present within tumour masses (as in refs 21 and 22), and less than 2\u2009mm from tumour cells, while NFs were defined by their association with normal epithelium more than 1\u2009cm outside tumour masses. Areas selected were devoid of visible cells other than target cell types. SMA staining [mouse monoclonal; M851 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), 1 : 1000] was performed using an IntelliPATH automated stainer (Menarini, Florence, Italy) and the manufacturer's standard conditions.Tissue culture, transfection, transduction, and functional assaysMCF7 and HB2 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Stable GFP expression was conferred by pTH-GFPa, a selectable GFP expression vector. MCF7 cells that stably express firefly luciferase were obtained from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA, USA; #AKR-234). Primary fibroblasts were isolated from breast surgical samples and immortalized by hTERT retroviral transduction as described previously. Reverse transfection of pre-/anti-miR (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and/or plasmids was performed using HiPerFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Stable miR-26b/control \u2018knock-down\u2019 was performed using pmiRZIP lentiviral vectors (System Biosciences, Mountain View, USA). Assays for cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were performed as described previously. Flow-cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were performed on LSRII (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and MoFlo (Dako) machines, respectively. Spheroid invasion assays were carried out using modifications of a previously described method. Spheroids were formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded, and 5\u2009\u00b5m sections stained with haematoxylin/eosin, or treated for immunohistochemistry (rabbit anti-cytokeratin, Ab9377; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; see ref 28) as above. Dual luciferase assays and pmiRGLO reporter were used (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.RNA extraction, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and microarray analysesRecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation for FFPE (Ambion) was used for RNA extraction from FFPE. MirVana miRNA Isolation (Ambion) and RNeasy (Qiagen) were used for extraction from cell lines of miRNA and mRNA, respectively. qPCR analyses were performed on 7500/7900HT machines in triplicate with Taqman assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Microarray analyses of miRNA expression were performed using human miRNA v2 arrays and system v1.7 reagents (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Further details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.Protein mass spectrometryPeptides from processed lysates of cell pellets were separated by capillary liquid chromatography (LC) and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using the RSLCnano system and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The data search against the IPI Human 3.87 database and label-free quantitation (LFQ) were performed using MaxQuant 1.2.2.5. Further details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) with two-tailed tests described in the text. Mass spectrometry data were analysed using R (OSX v2.15.1); expression levels were log2 median-normalized and analysed using t-tests, and p values converted to false discovery rates using Benjamini\u2013Hochberg methodology.ResultsMiRNA expression in breast NFs differs from that in CAFsWe compared the miRNA profiles of breast NFs with those of CAFs using two sources of cells: (i) fibroblasts isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using laser micro-dissection (LMD); and (ii) a tissue culture model in which breast fibroblasts were combined with either non-transformed breast epithelial cells or breast cancer epithelial cells.To validate our LMD protocols, we first prepared samples enriched for either epithelial cells or stromal fibroblasts from tissue blocks of a single breast cancer case [luminal A subtype, (ER+/her2\u2212)] and from matched normal breast tissue. Figure 1A shows representative LMD sections; fibroblast-enriched samples are referred to as fibroblast-enriched stroma (F). Tumour sections were stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA), demonstrating that the majority of CAFs were SMA-positive (Figure 1B). MiRNAs were extracted from LMD samples and microarrays were used to determine expression profiles. Of the 723 miRNAs analysed, 229 (32%) were detected in at least one sample. Many miRNAs were detected in fibroblast-enriched stroma that were not detected in epithelial cells from the same tissue (normal tissue: 86; cancer tissue: 68; Figure 1B), demonstrating that LMD had successfully allowed enrichment for separate cell populations and that the fibroblast-enriched stroma and epithelial miRNA profiles differed. Very few epithelial-specific miRNAs were identified (normal tissue: 3; cancer tissue: 7; Figure 1B). We then examined differential expression between normal and cancer as determined in fibroblast-enriched stroma or epithelial samples (Figure 1C). Seventy-six and 26 miRNAs were found to be down- or up-regulated, respectively, in both epithelium and fibroblast-enriched stroma, indicating some commonality between miRNA deregulation in these breast cancer compartments. A large number of miRNAs were found to be deregulated solely within fibroblast-enriched stroma (77 down; 82 up), while epithelial cell-specific deregulation was relatively rare (14 down; 16 up).Laser micro-dissection (LMD) allowed analysis of miRNA deregulation in the fibroblast and epithelial cell compartments of breast cancers. (A) Representative images of breast cancer tissue before (left) and after (right) LMD of fibroblast-enriched stroma or epithelial cells as labelled. FFPE breast tissue was sectioned and stained with toluidine blue. Regions for LMD were identified based on morphology. (B) Representative images of tumour sections stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA) using immunohistochemistry. (C, D) Total RNA was extracted from at least 5\u2009mm2 of LMD tissue enriched for fibroblasts or epithelial cells from breast cancer tissue or from matched normal breast tissue. Microarray analyses of miRNA expression were performed. (C) Numbers of miRNAs detected in only samples of fibroblast-enriched stroma (F), in both samples of fibroblast-enriched stroma and epithelial cells (F and E), or in only epithelial cell samples (E) are shown for each tissue. (D) Relative expression of each miRNA was compared between normal and cancer tissue within fibroblast-enriched stroma (F) or within epithelial cells (E). Numbers of individual miRNAs that were up- or down-regulated in those compartments are displayed in Venn diagrams showing how many were deregulated in common between compartments (the intersects), or were deregulated in one compartment only.MiRNA expression was also examined in a tissue culture model. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were co-cultured with either HB2 cells, breast epithelial cells of non-cancer origin considered to represent normal epithelium, or MCF7 cells, representative of epithelial cells of the most common breast cancer subtype (luminal A). Epithelial cell lines were stably labelled with GFP in order to allow their separate analysis within co-cultures. Fibroblasts had a potent and differential effect on the growth of the two epithelial cell types; the growth of MCF7 cancer cells was stimulated more than five-fold by fibroblasts, while the growth of HB2 cells was not altered (Figure 2). Thus, fibroblasts within the fibroblast/MCF7 co-culture behaved in a manner analogous to CAFs, while those within the fibroblast/HB2 co-culture exhibited less functional cross-talk. Fibroblasts were co-cultured with HB2 or MCF7 cells for 9\u2009days before being isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. MiRNA expression within these fibroblasts was examined using microarrays. Two hundred and twenty-six (31%) of the 723 miRNAs analysed were detected in at least one sample. One hundred and sixty-six miRNAs were expressed at lower levels, and 60 miRNAs were more highly expressed in the fibroblasts when they were cultured with MCF7 cancer cells (the CAF model), compared with those cultured with benign HB2 cells (the NF model).Growth of MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells, but not non-transformed \u2018normal\u2019 HB2 breast epithelial cells, was stimulated by immortalized breast fibroblasts. GFP-labelled MCF7 breast cancer cells (A) or HB2 benign breast epithelial cells (B) were co-cultured with immortalized breast fibroblasts (pictured), or were cultured alone, and epithelial cell growth was monitored by counting GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry for up to 10\u2009days. Data are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments.Next, we identified miRNAs that were consistently differentially expressed both between NFs and CAFs from clinical samples and between the tissue culture model \u2018NFs\u2019 and \u2018CAFs\u2019 (complete dataset\u2014Supplementary Data 1). One hundred and four miRNAs were down-regulated and ten miRNAs were up-regulated in CAFs in both assays (see Supplementary Data 2), representing a remarkably high degree of overlap (eg 69% of LMD-identified down-regulations were also seen in tissue culture, while 63% of tissue culture-identified down-regulations were also seen using LMD). Candidate miRNAs were further filtered using a cut-off of fold changes greater than 10 in both assays, which left six miRNAs that showed consistent and substantial down-regulation (Table1).Six miRNAs are consistently down-regulated more than ten-fold in breast CAFs compared with breast NFs in both tissues (comparing matched NF-enriched stroma and CAF-enriched stroma prepared by LMD; Figure 1) and a co-culture model [comparing immortalized breast fibroblasts co-cultured either with the benign breast epithelial cell line HB2 (representing NFs) or with the breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 (representing CAFs); Figure 2]. \u2018GeoMean fold change\u2019 is the Geomean of the fold change in tissues and in the co-culture modelMiRNA\tRegulation\tFold change (tissues)\tFold change (co-culture)\tGeoMean fold change\t \tMiR-7f\tDown\t47.6\t10.2\t22\t \tLet-7\u2009g\tDown\t15\t11.4\t13\t \tMiR-107\tDown\t13.1\t11.5\t12.3\t \tMiR-15b\tDown\t14.2\t10.8\t12.4\t \tMiR-26b\tDown\t21\t49.3\t32.2\t \tMiR-30b\tDown\t12.3\t30.2\t19.3\t \tMiR-26b is down-regulated in breast cancer CAFsMiR-26b was examined further as it showed the greatest mean fold change (Table1). Further samples enriched for NFs or CAFs were prepared by LMD from archival tissue blocks representing an additional 14 sequential cases of luminal A subtype breast cancers (defined as ER+/her2\u2212). MiR-26b expression was quantified using qPCR (Figure 3A). MiR-26b was down-regulated in CAF-enriched stroma compared with NF-enriched stroma in 11/14 cases (Figure 3A; Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank p\u2009=\u20090.04). We also examined miR-26b expression in matched primary cultures of NFs and CAFs isolated from four more breast cancer cases; miR-26b was down-regulated in CAFs in all cases (Figure 3B). Therefore, we found miR-26b to be down-regulated in CAFs in 15/18 cases in our validation cohort. Supplementary Table 1 shows the clinical features of this cohort.MiR-26b expression was frequently down-regulated in CAFs compared with matched NFs. (A) Samples enriched for fibroblasts were isolated by LMD from samples of matched breast cancer and normal tissue from 14 sequential cases of luminal A breast cancer (see Supplementary Table 1). (B) Primary cultures of matched NFs and CAFs were established from four further breast cancer cases. qPCR was used to analyse miR-26b expression relative to the geometric mean RNU6B and RNU48. Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error).Reduced miR-26b activity in fibroblasts inhibits growth but enhances migration and invasionWe examined whether manipulation of miR-26b levels resulted in changes in fibroblast behaviour. Firstly, we transiently transfected immortalized breast fibroblasts with anti-miR-26b or control molecules. We used qPCR to assess the degrees of miR-26b knock-down in these transfections. MiR-26b expression was reduced by more than three-fold (Figure 4A; p\u2009=\u20090.03), although it is worth noting that this may under-represent the reduction in miR-26b function since some miR-26b molecules detected may have been functionally sequestered in the cells by anti-miR-26b molecules. Transient knock-down of miR-26b caused a small but statistically significant reduction in fibroblast growth (Figure 4B; p\u2009=\u20090.02 at 48\u2009h). We also measured the migration of anti-miR-26b or control transfected fibroblasts using trans-well assays. Migration was significantly increased by more than three-fold by anti-miR-26b transfection (Figure 4C; p\u2009=\u20090.008). We also investigated the consequences of miR-26b overexpression by transiently transfecting fibroblasts with pre-miR-26b or control molecules. MiR-26b overexpression caused dramatic and rapid cell death (Supplementary Figure 1), as has been observed previously in colorectal cancer cells. However, qPCR analyses revealed that miR-26b was overexpressed by more than 1000-fold in these transfections (Supplementary Figure 1C). We believe that this lacks clinical relevance since this degree of overexpression greatly exceeded differential miR-26b expression in matched NFs and CAFs (Figure 3); therefore, we did not proceed with further overexpression studies.Transient miR-26b down-regulation in breast fibroblasts inhibited growth but stimulated migration. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were transiently transfected with anti-miR-26b molecules or with control anti-miRs. (A) MiR-26b expression was quantified 24\u2009h after transfection using qPCR (relative to RNU6B). Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments. (B) Cell growth was monitored by MTT assays over 72\u2009h. (C) Migration of fibroblasts was assessed 24\u2009h after transfection using trans-well migration assays by manual counting of cells that had passed through the membranes. Data in B and C are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments.To study the consequences of reduced miR-26b function, we stably knocked down miR-26b in breast fibroblasts using lentiviral vectors (which also conferred GFP expression). Fibroblasts were stably transduced to reduce miR-26b function (designated \u201826bk/d\u2019), or were transduced with control virus (designated \u2018controlk/d\u2019), and flow cytometry was used to enrich populations to maintain more than 90% transduced cells (GFP-positive). A two-fold reduction in miR-26b expression was observed by qPCR (Figure 5A; p\u2009=\u20090.02). As before, we were conscious that this might not accurately reflect functional knock-down; we therefore also performed luciferase reporter assays to assess miR-26b function. A single, fully complementary miR-26b binding site was cloned downstream of the luciferase reading frame in a reporter, and 26bk/d or controlk/d cells were transfected with the reporter. Luciferase assays demonstrated that 26bk/d cells allowed two-fold higher expression of a miR-26b target (Figure 5B; p\u2009=\u20090.001), indicative of reduced miR-26b function. We also examined the influences of miR-26b knock-down on cell growth/viability by both monitoring the growth of 26bk/d and controlk/d cells (Figure 5C) and examining their cell cycle distributions (Figure 5D). In accordance with our previous findings (Figure 4A), we found that 26bk/d cells grew slightly more slowly than controlk/d cells (p\u2009=\u20090.01 at 72\u2009h). This appeared to relate to a cell cycle defect represented by an increase in cells in the G2/M phase (Figure 5D; p\u2009=\u20090.02). However, these growth and cell cycle defects are minor and may lack biological relevance. Next, we examined the migratory or invasive capacities of 26bk/d and controlk/d cells using scratch-closure and trans-well migration assays, or trans-well Matrigel invasion assays. 26bk/d cells showed increased migration in scratch-closure assays, although this fell just short of statistical significance (Figure 5E; p\u2009=\u20090.06). However, 26bk/d cells demonstrated significantly enhanced migration and invasion in trans-well assays (Figure 5F, p\u2009=\u20090.001; Figure 5G, p\u2009=\u20090.03). A second independent immortalized breast fibroblast line was also transduced to knock down miR-26b (designated \u201826bk/d2\u2019) or was control transduced (designated \u2018controlk/d2\u2019); this also demonstrated significantly enhanced migration and invasion after miR-26b knock-down (Figure 5F, p\u2009=\u20090.02; Figure 5G, p\u2009=\u20090.02). We concluded that breast fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b, as seen in CAFs, exhibited reduced growth but increased motility and invasive capabilities.Stable down-regulation of miR-26b in breast fibroblasts inhibited growth but stimulated both migration and invasion. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were stably transduced to knock down miR-26b (26k/d) or with a control construct (conk/d). (A) MiR-26b expression was quantified in the two cell lines using qPCR (relative to RNU6B). Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments. (B) MiR-26b function was assessed as ratios of firefly to Renilla luciferase expression using a miR-26b target luciferase reporter (containing a perfect miR-26b binding site downstream of firefly luciferase and also coding for Renilla luciferase as an internal control). Cell lines were transfected with the reporter and dual luciferase assays were performed after 24\u2009h. (C) Cell growth in the two cell lines was monitored using MTT assays over 72\u2009h after initial seeding of equal numbers of cells. (D) Proportions of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined in sub-confluent cultures using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. (E) Migration was determined in scratch-closure assays using digital imaging as the percentage scratch area remaining 18\u2009h after scratch formation. Representative images are shown immediately after forming the scratch and at 18\u2009h. (F) Migration was determined in trans-well assays by manual counting of cells that had passed through the membrane. A representative example of the trans-well migration result is shown. A second independent breast fibroblast line was also stably transduced (26k/d2 and conk/d2). Cells having migrated through the membranes were counted at 12\u2009h for 26k/d and conk/d and at 24\u2009h for 26k/d2 and conk/d2 (the second pair of transduced fibroblast lines migrated/invaded more slowly, reflecting variation between individual parental fibroblasts). (G) Invasion was assessed using trans-well assays by manual counting (at the same time points as F). Data in B\u2013G are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate (B, D\u2013G) or triplicate (C) experiments.Reduced miR-26b activity in fibroblasts enhances migration/invasion of epithelial cancer cellsWe were especially interested to determine whether miR-26b in breast fibroblasts could modify epithelial cancer cell behaviour. We co-cultured either 26bk/d or controlk/d fibroblasts with MCF7 epithelial cancer cells. We used MCF7 cells that stably express luciferase in order to quantify them separately within co-cultures. As expected, the presence of fibroblasts enhanced MCF7 growth (see Figure 2), but 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts did not have differential influences (Figure 6A). This experiment was performed seeding epithelial cells and fibroblasts at a ratio of 1 : 3 in accordance with published literature; differential influences of 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts on epithelial growth were also not seen at other ratios (Supplementary Figure 2). Next, migration and invasion assays were performed with MCF7/fibroblast co-cultures (seeding ratios of 1 : 3). In trans-well assays, MCF7 cells demonstrated significantly enhanced migration in the presence of 26bk/d fibroblasts (Figure 6B; p\u2009=\u20090.008), although a trend for enhanced invasion fell short of statistical significance (Figure 6C). This enhanced migration of MCF7 cells was not reproduced when the fibroblasts were seeded separately in the lower chambers of the trans-wells (Supplementary Figure 3). Invasion assays were also performed using three-dimensional spheroids, which better reflect in vivo interactions between cells and the microenvironment. MCF7 cells were aggregated with 26bk/d or controlk/d fibroblasts, or with each of the second pair of transduced fibroblasts, 26bk/d2 or controlk/d2, before being encased in collagen-I/Matrigel matrix and incubated for up to 48\u2009h. Invasion into the matrix of large groups of cells was dramatically enhanced by the 26bk/d fibroblasts (Figure 6D; p\u2009=\u20090.01) compared with controls; indeed, these outgrowths were absent in the presence of one control line. These striking outgrowths were characterized in more detail by staining with haematoxylin and eosin (Figure 6E) or for epithelial cytokeratins (Figure 6F). Outgrowths contained predominantly epithelial cells (based on morphology and positive cytokeratin expression; labelled \u2018e\u2019) with some internal fibroblasts (based on morphology and/or negative cytokeratin expression; labelled \u2018f1\u2019). Fibroblasts were mainly visible on the external surface of outgrowths (labelled \u2018f2\u2019) and radiating through the matrix from the spheroid (labelled \u2018f3\u2019).MCF7 cell migration and invasion are stimulated by breast fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b. MCF7 cells (luciferase-positive) were co-cultured with miR-26b knock-down (26k/d) or with control (conk/d) breast fibroblasts (seeding ratio of one epithelial cell to three fibroblasts). (A) MCF7 cell growth was monitored within co-cultures using luciferase assays over 72\u2009h (entire co-cultures were lysed and luciferase activity, present within the epithelial cells only, was quantified). (B, C) Migration or invasion of MCF7 cells within co-cultures was assessed 24\u2009h after seeding in trans-well assays using luciferase assays (cells having passed through the membrane were lysed and luciferase activity was quantified within the lysates). (D) MCF7 cells and fibroblasts were aggregated, forming three-dimensional spheroids, and were suspended in a collagen-I/Matrigel matrix for up to 48\u2009h. Invasion of MCF7 cells away from the central spheroid was quantified as shown at 48\u2009h. Assays were performed with 26k/d or conk/d fibroblasts and with equivalent lines derived from an independent breast fibroblast line (line 2). (E, F) Spheroids were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were taken and stained using haematoxylin and eosin (E) or for epithelial cytokeratins (F). Scale bars (top right of each image)\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00b5m. Epithelial cells (cobblestone morphology/cytokeratin-positive) are labelled \u2018e\u2019, while populations of fibroblasts (elongated morphology/cytokeratin-negative) are labelled \u2018f1\u2019 (internal to spheroid outgrowth), \u2018f2\u2019 (surface of outgrowth), and \u2018f3\u2019 (within matrix radiating from spheroid). Data are means of at least biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate (B\u2013D) or triplicate (A) experiments.MiR-26b regulates multiple molecular pathways in breast fibroblastsOur next aim was to determine the molecular pathways responsible for the altered behaviour of 26bk/d fibroblasts. Initially, we identified potential direct miR-26b targets using bioinformatics (TargetScan; http://www.targetscan.org); these predictions suggested that miR-26b might target more than 100 different transcripts. In order to identify pathways altered in breast fibroblasts, we carried out proteomic comparisons of 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts. Label-free protein mass spectrometry was performed on triplicate flasks of both cell types (dataset\u2014Supplementary Data 3). As expected, expressions in the triplicates were highly related, with mean Spearman's rho coefficients for pairwise comparisons between triplicates of 0.83 and 0.85 for 26bk/d and controlk/d cells, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We identified proteins that were significantly differentially expressed between the lines. Three hundred and sixty proteins (of a total of 3369 detected) were differentially expressed (Student's t-test; p\u2009<\u20090.05). When multiple testing was taken into account using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1, this was reduced to 11 proteins (Table2). In order to determine molecular pathways that were deregulated in 26bk/d cells, we subjected the protein lists to gene ontology analyses (ToppGene Suite; http://toppgene.cchmc.org/). The list of 360 proteins was significantly enriched for genes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle (nine genes from 35 in the genome; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and in cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases (14 from 72; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Supplementary Table 2). For identification of potential direct miR-26b targets, we limited our analyses to changes in expression identified at an FDR of less than 0.1. We examined whether the 11 differentially expressed proteins were predicted miR-26b targets and whether this correlated with up- or down-regulation; up-regulation in 26bk/d cells was expected for direct miR-26b targets. Five proteins were up-regulated in 26bk/d cells, three of which were predicted targets, while six were down-regulated, none of which were predicted targets (Table2). This distribution of predicted targets supports the conclusion that these three predictions are true direct targets. These are tankyrase 1 binding protein 1 (TNKS1BP1), cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 7 (CPSF7), and collagen type XII alpha 1 (COL12A1). The functional relevance of these three molecules was examined further by mining publicly available data. Expression data are available for 53 breast cancers from which cancer stroma was isolated by LMD and stromal mRNA expression levels were profiled using expression arrays. We tested whether stromal expression of TNKS1BP1, CPSF7 or COL12A1 was associated with differences in time to recurrence. Expression was dichotomized using Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis in order to allow Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses of groups with high and low expression. For each gene, high expression, as seen in 26bk/d cells, was significantly associated with increased rates of recurrence (Figure 7; log rank, TNKS1BP1 p\u2009=\u20090.002, CPSF7 p\u2009=\u20090.007, COL12A1 p\u2009=\u20090.043), implicating them, and by inference miR-26b, as stromal determinants of breast cancer outcome.Proteins differentially expressed between controlk/d and 26k/d fibroblasts (false discovery rate\u2009<\u20090.1). Immortalized breast fibroblasts were virally transduced to reduce expression of miR-26b (26k/d) or were control transduced (controlk/d).

Correlations between high and low (as defined using ROC analyses) stromal expression of TNKS1BP1, CPSF7 or COL12A1 and breast cancer recurrence were tested using Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses, using publicly available mRNA expression array data from laser capture micro-dissected stromal breast cancer tissue from 53 breast cancers, mined using the Oncomine platform (https://www.oncomine.org).DiscussionCAFs are known to differ from NFs in their expression profiles and, consequently, in their behaviour and influences on epithelial cancer cells. However, the molecular basis of these expression differences is poorly understood, with signalling from cancer and other stromal cells, as well as epigenetic deregulation, implicated as key influences. We examined whether miRNA expression differs substantially between NFs and CAFs and whether these differences regulate fibroblast behaviour. We focused on miR-26b, since it was deregulated (down-regulated in CAFs) to the greatest extent in our screens (Table1). Down-regulation of miR-26b has been observed previously in various cancers, including glioma, head/neck/oral cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and breast cancer, and has generally correlated with higher grade or more aggressive cancer types. This conclusion is supported by the fact that low miR-26b expression correlated significantly with poor cancer survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, and in breast cancer in our analysis of publicly available miRNA expression data (Supplementary Figure 4). It should be emphasized that all of these studies analysed expression in cell populations that included both cancer and stromal cells; therefore it is not possible to be certain of the cell type in which miR-26b is expressed and functional. An exception to this is a recent analysis of miRNA expression in six paired primary cultures of NFs and CAFs from breast cancers, in which miR-26b was identified as down-regulated in CAFs, in accordance with our findings, although it is important to note that this study included no assessments of the function or targets of miR-26b.At least 14 different direct targets for miR-26b have been suggested in the literature (see Supplementary Table 3) in a range of other cell types and supported by differing levels of proof. The vast majority of these potential target proteins were not detected in our proteomic analyses, but those that were showed no evidence of significant differential expression between 26bk/d and controlk/d cells. This is compatible with the suggestion that miR-26b targets multiple transcripts and that these vary with cell type. We identified three miR-26b targets in breast fibroblasts and established that their expression in this compartment was significantly associated with survival from breast cancer (Figure 7). These molecules are functionally diverse: TNKS1BP1 is involved in telomere maintenance; CPSF7 regulates polyadenylation; and COL12A1 is an extracellular matrix component. This diversity hints at the potential for miR-26b to have broad-ranging influences on cellular physiology, as has been seen with some other miRNAs. Importantly in this context, we analysed downstream effects of manipulating miR-26b at a wider proteome level. We identified two significantly deregulated pathways: glycolysis/TCA cycle; and cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases. For glycolysis/TCA, all genes were up-regulated in 26bk/d fibroblasts and they included enzymes that catalyse five of the nine main steps of glycolysis. Similar up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes has recently been reported in bladder cancer stroma. These observations are potentially compatible with the \u2018reverse Warburg effect\u2019, as described by Lisanti and co-workers, in which CAFs carry out aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate and pyruvate that are used, in part, by neighbouring cancer cells. However, published work suggests that this results in enhanced cancer cell growth, which we did not find (Figure 6A), rather than the enhanced cancer cell migration/invasion that we saw (Figures 6B\u20136F). With respect to the second pathway, the influences of Rho GTPases on cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility are well established. Notably, Rho signalling has been implicated in CAF-mediated remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, leading to enhanced invasion of cancer cells, a model discussed further below.We have shown that reduced miR-26b can enhance breast fibroblast migration and invasion (Figures 4 and 5) and that this, in turn, can stimulate migration and invasion of epithelial cancer cells in the context of epithelial/fibroblast co-cultures (Figure 6). At least two models have been proposed to explain this stromal\u2013epithelial cross-talk. Firstly, fibroblasts secrete soluble paracrine factors that stimulate epithelial migration/invasion directly. Secondly, fibroblasts modify the structural microenvironment, making it more permissive for epithelial migration/invasion. From our data, we believe that a soluble paracrine factor that acts directly on the epithelial cells is less likely, since we were unable to recapitulate the influence of 26bk/d fibroblasts on epithelial cells when the cells were physically separated in culture (Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore, our preferred model is one that involves modification of the structural microenvironment. Potentially, enhanced epithelial invasion could be a passive phenomenon where epithelial invasion occurs simply by following the passage of fibroblasts through the matrix, making use of the \u2018holes\u2019 that remain behind the fibroblasts; in this case, fibroblasts would be simply removing the barrier of the matrix that inhibits epithelial movement. However, our data indicate that the fibroblasts' influence is more complex. 26bk/d fibroblasts significantly stimulated the migration of epithelial cells in trans-wells lacking matrix, where there was no barrier for the fibroblasts to remove and no matrix in which fibroblasts could leave these \u2018holes\u2019 (Figure 6B). In addition, controlk/d fibroblasts invaded from spheroids, albeit to a lesser degree than 26bk/d fibroblasts, presumably leaving the \u2018holes\u2019 in the matrix, but epithelial invasion was hardly detectable at all. We interpret this to suggest that active stimulation of epithelial migration/invasion through stimulatory modifications to the matrix is a component of the 26bk/d fibroblasts' influence. Fibroblasts enhance the invasion of squamous cell carcinoma cells in a similar way, with both matrix \u2018holes\u2019 and fibroblast deposition of the matrix components fibronectin and tenascin-C implicated as potential stimulatory mediators of epithelial invasion. In this case, RhoA signalling in the fibroblasts was found to be important for both hole formation and matrix deposition, which correlates with our observation of deregulation of the Rho pathway. The roles of fibronectin and tenascin-C in stimulating this migration/invasion remain to be fully elucidated. COL12A1 presents a further candidate molecule for roles in making the matrix permissive for migration/invasion as it is known to organize and stabilize matrix fibrils of collagen type I, a main matrix component in our spheroid assay. In addition, increased COL12A1 expression has recently been noted at colorectal cancer invasive fronts, implicating COL12A1 in invasion.Author contribution statementETV, TAH, AMH, and MH designed the experiments and analysed the data.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

        "title": "Fibulin-1 suppression of fibronectin-regulated cell adhesion and motility.",
        "content": "Fibulin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein often associated with fibronectin (FN) in vivo. In this study, the ability of fibulin-1 to modulate adhesion, spreading and motility-promoting activities of FN was investigated. Fibulin-1 was found to have pronounced inhibitory effects on the cell attachment and spreading promoted by FN. Fibulin-1 was also found to inhibit the motility of a variety of cell types on FN substrata. For example, the FN-dependent haptotactic motility of breast carcinoma (MDA MB231) cells, epidermal carcinoma (A431), melanoma (A375 SM), rat pulmonary aortic smooth muscle cells (PAC1) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was inhibited by the presence of fibulin-1 bound to FN-coated Boyden chamber membranes. Cells transfected to overproduce fibulin-1 displayed reduced velocity, distance of movement and persistence time on FN substrata. Similarly, the incorporation of fibulin-1 into FN-containing type I collagen gels inhibited the invasion of endocardial cushion mesenchymal cells migrating from cultured embryonic heart explants. By contrast, incorporation of fibulin-1 into collagen gels lacking FN had no effect on the migration of endocardial cushion cells. These results suggest that the motility-suppressive effects of fibulin-1 might be FN specific. Furthermore, such effects are cell-type specific, in that the migration of gingival fibroblasts and endothelial cells on FN substrata is not responsive to fibulin-1. Additional studies found that the mechanism for the motility-suppressive effects of fibulin-1 does not involve perturbations of interactions between alpha5beta1 or alpha4 integrins, or heparan sulfate proteoglycans with FN. However, fibulin-1 was found to inhibit extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation and to suppress phosphorylation of myosin heavy chain. This ability to influence signal transduction cascades that modulate the actin-myosin motor complex might be the basis for the effects of fibulin-1 on adhesion and motility.",

        "content": "Recent advances indicate that cancer\u2011associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a key role in cancer progression by contributing to invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Solid tumors often experience low oxygen tension environments, which induce gene expression changes and biological features leading to poor outcomes. The G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) exhibits a stimulatory role in diverse types of cancer cells and in CAFs under hypoxic conditions. We investigated the role of CAFs and hypoxia in breast cancer aggressiveness, and examined the effect of GPER in CAFs on hypoxia-driven breast cancer progression. The results showed that hypoxia upregulated HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs, and induced the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in CAFs. However, GPER silencing abrogated the above hypoxia-driven cytokine expression in CAFs. Moreover, knockdown of GPER in CAFs suppressed breast cancer cell invasion induced by CAF conditioned media (CM). Furthermore, GPER silencing in CAFs inhibited hypoxia-increased CTGF expression in CAFs and breast cancer cells cultured with CM from CAFs under hypoxic conditions. In addition, CTGF is responsible for the observed effects of GPER on CAFs activation and breast cancer invasion. Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression. ",

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

These interactions in turn promote the invasion of the parenchyma of surrounding tissues and of distant organs by invasive/metastatic tumor cells. At the center of this behavior of invasive cancer cells is the formation of mature and functional adhesion plaques at sites of cell contact with the ECM and/or adherens junctions between the tumor cells on one hand and on the other hand, between normal and tumor cells. Adhesion plaques and adherens junctions are stabilized by the highly dynamic actin cytoskeleton that in turn is modulated by a large number of actin binding proteins. Amongst these proteins are members of the annexin family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding proteins.Annexins Ca2+-dependently interact with distinct plasma membrane regions to promote membrane segregation and each annexin family member requires a different Ca2+ concentration for its translocation to the membrane. Although their precise functions remain unclear, their Ca2+ responsiveness and membrane binding properties, suggests that annexins may link Ca2+ signaling with actin dynamics at membrane contact sites. Available evidence nevertheless reveal that annexins regulate a multitude of signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, cell motility, tumor invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis and drug resistance via distinct mechanisms.Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is an unusual member of the annexin family in that it contains eight rather than four annexin repeats. Consequently, it has been shown to interact with biological membranes with slightly different kinetics compared with other members of the family. In a recent study, constitutive plasma membrane targeting of AnxA6 not only stabilized the cortical actin cytoskeleton but also inhibited store-operated Ca2+ influx and cell proliferation. In support of these observations, ectopic expression of AnxA6 in the AnxA6-null A431 squamous epithelial carcinoma cells reduced their proliferation. Other studies have also shown that AnxA6 is down-regulated in chronic myeloid leukemia and as melanomas progress from a benign to a more malignant phenotype. Meanwhile, depletion of AnxA6 in MDA-MB-436 invasive breast cancer cells led to increased anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Together this suggests that in breast cancer AnxA6 may not only act as a tumor suppressor but also as a cell adhesion/motility promoting factor.In the present study we examined the involvement of AnxA6 in adhesion-related cellular processes that contribute to breast cancer progression. We demonstrate that AnxA6 expression correlates with the invasive phenotype of breast cancer and that depletion of this protein in the invasive BT-549 breast cancer cells inhibited cellular adhesion, motility and invasiveness. We also show that that the enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation of BT-549 cells following AnxA6 depletion requires sustained MAP kinase activation, while the loss of invasiveness of AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells may be attributed to its role in the formation of functional focal contacts at appropriate plasma membrane locations and that this is driven by the activation of the phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase/Akt pathway. These data suggest that reduced AnxA6 expression contributes to breast cancer progression by promoting the loss of functional cell-cell and/or cell-ECM contacts and anchorage-independent cell proliferation.Materials and MethodsMaterialsPolyclonal antibodies to AnxA2, AnxA4, AnxA6 as well as phospho-focal adhesion kinase (p-Y397) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Polyclonal antibodies to E-cadherin, N-Cadherin, phospho-PKB/Akt (p-S473) and phospho-ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). Monoclonal antibodies to ERK2 as well as HRP, FITC or Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies were also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., (Santa Cruz, CA USA). Monoclonal antibody to \u03b2-actin and vinculin, were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded thin sections of normal human breast and breast cancer tissues were purchased from Biomax-US (Rockville, MD, USA). Except otherwise indicated cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen or Sigma.Cell lines and cell cultureThe breast cancer cell lines BT-549, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MCF-10A were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). A sub-clone of BT-549 cells stably over-expressing Galectin-3 (clone 11-9-1-4) herein designated BT-Gal3, was a gift from Dr. Avraham Raz (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA). These cell lines were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's nutrient F12 (DMEM/F12) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml) in a 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. Human mammary epithelial cells (HuMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer Pietenpol (Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt Medical Center, Nashville, TN) and were cultured in complete HuMEC Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from ATCC and maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml). The media were changed every 2 to 3 days and except otherwise indicated, cells were sub-cultured by treatment with 0.25% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).RNAiSub-confluent BT-549 cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) seeded in six-well plates were transfected with 4 \u03bcg/well of purified AnxA6-targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in plasmid pSM2c (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) by using Fugene6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Biochemicals). The sequences of the targeted sense region are A6A 5\u2019-CACTCGGACCAATGCTGA-3\u2019 and A6B 5\u2019-GACCTCATTGCTGATTTAA-3\u2019. Puromycin (2.5\u03bcg/ml) surviving clones were isolated and propagated in selection medium (complete DMEM/F12 containing 2.0 \u03bcg/ml puromycin) as long as the cells were in culture. AnxA6 down regulation in the stable BT-549 clones was verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibodies to AnxA6.Isolation of secreted and surface-associated proteinsCells were cultured until they attained 70-80% confluence. These were then harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in HBSS (Hepes-buffered saline: 11 mM Hepes, 137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM glucose) and equal numbers incubated in HBSS with or without 2 mM Ca2+ for two hrs at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 4 min and the culture supernatants (CS) containing total secreted proteins were transferred to new tubes. These were cleared of any cells by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The final supernatant containing the secreted proteins was concentrated by ultrafiltration using the Millipore MCO-3,000 ultrafiltration unit and equal volumes of the extracts used for analysis.EGTA-elution of surface associated proteins was performed as previously described. Briefly, cells pretreated with or without Ca2+ as above were washed once with HBSS and incubated with HBSS containing 10 mM EGTA for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with occasional shaking. The cells were once again harvested by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 4 min and the supernatant containing EGTA-solubilized surface-associated proteins (SAP) was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. These were analyzed alongside total cell lysates and the secreted proteins.Cell fractionationTotal cellular proteins were prepared by resuspending cells in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and incubation on ice for 30 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the preparation of cytosolic and membrane-enriched cellular fractions, cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), homogenized by passage six times through 26G needle and incubated on ice for 30 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 2,300 \u00d7 g for 4 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate the nuclei from the post nuclear supernatants. The post nuclear supernatants were in turn centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C using the Sorvall M150 micro-ultracentrifuge and S120-AT2 rotor. The resulting supernatants comprising cytosolic proteins were transferred to new tubes while the pellets (membrane-enriched faction) were extracted in ice-cold RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was transferred to new tubes. The protein content of total cellular proteins or various fractions was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and equal amounts of proteins used for protein electrophoresis and immunoblotting as previously described.ImmunohistochemistryMicroscope slides containing thin sections of paraffin-embedded formalin fixed normal, mucous adenocarcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma human breast tissues (US Biomax, Rockville, MD) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with decreasing graded alcohol. Antigen retrieval was performed in 0.1M sodium citrate pH 6.0 by heating to 95-96 \u00b0C for 20 minutes followed by cooling to room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase blocking, incubation with the indicated primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were performed as described in the Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin HRP kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The thin sections were subsequently treated with diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 min. Slides were then dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol, cleared in xylene and mounted with cover slips. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioscope Microscope. Quantification was performed from four randomly chosen fields using NIH ImageJ software.ImmunofluorescenceCells were grown on glass cover slips in complete DMEM/F12 overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Except otherwise indicated the cells were serum-starved for 24 h by cultivating them in complete DMEM/F12 in which FBS was replaced with 0.1% BSA. The cells were subsequently fixed in -20 \u00b0C cold methanol or in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with ice-cold HBSS and fixed in 3% PFA in PBS. For observation of adhesion plaques, cells were pretreated with 3% PFA in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min followed by fixation in 3% PFA. Cells were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, then incubated with first and secondary antibodies as recently described. For detection of surface-associated AnxA6, non permeabilized PFA-fixed cells were probed with monoclonal anti-AnxA6 antibody followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Samples were washed extensively between the treatments and cover slips were mounted with Prolong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). F-actin was detected by incubating PFA-fixed and permeabilized cells with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) diluted 1/20 in PBS. Samples were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000-E inverted microscope equipped with NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA).Cell Proliferation AssaysFor anchorage-independent growth, cells were cultured in complete medium in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(Hema))-coated plates were prepared as previously described. For growth curves in 2D cultures, cells were plated into a 96-well flat bed plate at a density of 2 \u00d7 103 cells per well in triplicate then incubated for up to 7 days with medium changed every 3 days. At the end of each time point the alamar blue reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was diluted 1:10 in HBSS supplemented with 1 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+. The culture medium was aspirated and replaced with 100 \u03bcl of diluted reagent per well, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 4-6 h. The proliferation and viability of the cells was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 versus 600 nm.Cell adhesion/spreadingWells of 96-well plates were coated in quadruplicate with 0.5 mg/ml Fetuin-A, 0.1 mg/ml of either collagen type I, collagen type IV, laminin or fibronectin overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Prior to use in cell attachment/spreading assays, the coating solutions were aspirated and 1 \u00d7 104 cells in serum-free DMEM/F12 were added to each well and incubated overnight (16-24 h) at 37 \u00b0C. Controls cells were seeded in complete DMEM/F12 or serum-free DMEM/F12. After aspirating the floating cells the attached cells were photographed using DCM200 digital camera equipped with Scopephoto software (ScopeTek, Hangzhou, China) and cell numbers and viability estimated by alamar blue colorimetric assay as described above.Three-dimensional growth on MatrigelThis was performed as described previously. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of growth factor reduced Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA, USA) were dispensed into wells of a 96-well microtitre plate and allowed to gel at 37 \u00b0C for at least 30 min. Cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in complete DMEM/F12 medium and then plated at a density of 5 \u00d7 103 cells per well. These were then incubated for up to 10 days with medium changes after every 4 days. The 3-D structures were captured with DCM200 digital camera and Scopephoto software.Transwell Migration and Invasion AssaysMigration and invasion assays were determined in triplicate using 24-well, 8 \u03bcm pore transwell inserts and Matrigel coated transwell invasion chambers respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA, USA). Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice and resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F12. DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS was then added to the lower chamber as the chemoattractant and 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 500 \u03bcl of serum-free DMEM/F12 were added to the upper insert chamber or on the Matrigel layer. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h the cell suspension in the upper chamber was aspirated and excess Matrigel and/or cells on the insert membrane were removed using a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the insert membrane or invaded the Matrigel and insert membrane and reached the lower surface of the filter were subsequently fixed in 3% PFA in PBS, stained with crystal violet and counted under a light microscope. Digital images were captured with DCM200 digital camera and Scopephoto software (ScopeTek, Hangzhou, China). Three random fields were counted for each sample.ResultsCell surface expression of annexins in breast cancer cells occurs via the exosomal pathwayPrevious studies in our laboratory demonstrated that AnxA2, AnxA4 and AnxA6 interact with the abundant serum glycoprotein fetuin-A on the surface of BT-549 breast cancer cells. Since the interaction of annexins with membranes exhibit a high degree of Ca2+ sensitivity these proteins can be efficiently eluted by EGTA treatment of the intact cells. To test the possibility that other breast cancer cells express and externalize annexins, we treated MCF-7, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines as well as MCF-10A known to retain many characteristics of normal breast epithelial cells with EGTA to elute the Ca2+-dependently cell surface-associated proteins (herein denoted SAP). As shown in Fig. 1A, the three breast cancer cell lines express AnxA2, AnxA4 and AnxA6. Surprisingly, MCF-10A cells are AnxA6-null (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 6). In the annexin-positive cell lines these proteins are also detected in the EGTA-solubilized SAP extracts. However, the expression levels of AnxA2 and AnxA4 are up-regulated in the AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells and in the AnxA6-null MCF-10A (Fig. 1A and supplementary Fig. 1A and B).To show that surface expression of these proteins involves their secretion via the exosomal pathway, BT-549 cells were cultured in HBSS with or without Ca2+ for 2 h and the secreted proteins in the culture supernatants (CS) were fractionated into exosome-free (ExF) and exosome-associated (Exos) fractions as recently described. At the end of the treatment the viability of the cells by the Trypan blue exclusion method was at least 98%. To verify that the viability of the cells was not affected by incubation in HBSS or HBSS/EGTA we used a cytotoxicity assay based on secreted lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). As shown in supplementary Fig. S1C and D the basal secretion of LDH by adherent BT-549 cells in complete DMEM/F12 was ~11.5% of total cellular LDH (data not shown). Secretion in HBSS at 37 \u00b0C ranged from 8.3-10.1% over the 2 h period and 5.2-7.6% in HBSS/EGTA on ice. Analysis of the secreted fractions, the corresponding SAP extracts and total cellular proteins by immunoblotting revealed that AnxA2 and AnxA6 are Ca2+-dependently secreted by these cells (compare Fig. 1B lanes 4 and 5). The secreted proteins were enriched in the exosomal fractions (Fig. 1B lanes 8 and 9) compared to the exosome-free fractions (Fig. 1B lanes 6 and 7). As expected, Fig. 1B also shows that these proteins were more abundant in the membrane-associated, EGTA-solubilized extracts than in the culture supernatants (Fig. 1B lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). Finally, as shown in Fig. 1C, AnxA6 is at least 6-fold more abundant on the surface of BT-549 cells than AnxA2. Similar low levels (< 5% of total cellular AnxA2) of cell-surface-associated AnxA2 were also observed in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (data not shown).To verify the expression of AnxA6 in BT-549 cells, cells were pretreated with or without 2.0 mM Ca2+ and stained with monoclonal antibodies to AnxA6 and co-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (F-actin) and DAPI (nuclei). As depicted in supplementary Fig. S2, and as expected, AnxA6 co-localized with F-actin. In most of the cells, AnxA6 and actin are concentrated in the plasma membrane with discernible membrane protrusions. The intensity of AnxA6 and F-actin in these membrane protrusions increased with Ca2+ concentration (supplementary Fig. S2A, arrows) and may represent early stages of cell adhesion. To demonstrate that a pool of AnxA6 is cell surface-associated, non-permeabilized cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to AnxA6. This revealed that cell surface-associated AnxA6 is concentrated in the membrane protrusions (Fig. S2B, arrows).AnxA6 influences growth and adhesion-related properties of BT-549 breast carcinoma cellsBased on the above data, we hypothesized that AnxA6 may influence the adhesion-related properties (cellular adhesion, motility and invasiveness) of invasive breast cancer cells by linking the cell surface to the ECM (extracellular AnxA6) or the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton (intracellular AnxA6). To test this hypothesis, we established stable AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells by transfecting these cells with shRNA constructs designated A6A and A6B which target distinct regions of AnxA6 coding sequence (ANXA6 transcript variant 1, accession number NM_001155.3). Analysis of the transfected cells by western blotting (Fig. 2A) revealed that depletion of AnxA6 was more efficient in the A6A shRNA transfected cells (herein designated BT-A6A) compared to the A6B shRNA transfected cells (herein designated BT-A6B). The extent of down regulation was >98% in BT-A6A and ~40% in BT-A6B cells compared to the parental or empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 2B). We also show that depletion of AnxA6 in BT-549 cells led to about 2-fold (range 1.5-3 fold) increase in the expression levels of AnxA2 and AnxA4 (Fig. 2A, lane 3). This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies to these annexin family members (supplementary Fig. 3).To determine any changes in cell morphology following AnxA6 depletion, parental BT-549, BT-A6A and BT-A6B cells were grown on cell culture plastics in complete medium and examined by phase contract microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2C, compared to the parental BT-549 cells (upper panel), the BT-A6A cells (middle panel) are characteristically spindle-shaped while the BT-A6B cells (lower panel) have characteristically long lamellipodia. This reveals that reduced AnxA6 expression dose dependently altered the morphology of BT-549 cells.Given the efficient depletion of AnxA6 in the BT-A6A cells these were used in most of the subsequent experiments with the parental BT-549 cells as the control. We first wanted to verify whether AnxA6 is indispensable for anchorage-dependent growth. Parental BT-549 and BT-A6A cells were seeded onto plates coated with or without polyHEMA in complete DMEM/F12 medium and the cell populations observed for up to 48 hrs. As depicted in Fig. 3A, parental BT-549 cells grew as cell masses in anchorage-independent mode while AnxA6-depleted cells proliferated as single cells. In agreement with the growth of AnxA6-depleted MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells, BT-A6A cells continued to proliferate without attaining confluence while the parental cells were confluent by day four (Fig. 3B). This suggests that AnxA6 expression is essential for the formation of cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts and that loss of AnxA6 abolishes contact inhibition and promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation.To ascertain that AnxA6-depletion abolished contact inhibition, BT-549 and BT-A6A cells were cultured on fetuin-A or fibronectin coated cover slips and visualized by F-actin staining. Fig. 3C shows that BT-A6A cells grew as clumps on fetuin-A coated cover slips (Fig. 3C, left panel) but surprisingly, these cells attached and spread on fibronectin-coated cover slips (Fig. 3C, right panel). As a consequence of this loss in contact inhibition, BT-A6A cells do not form confluent monolayers and require longer times (16-48h) to attach when cultured in complete medium containing 10% FBS unlike the parental cells. The observed defects in cell adhesion and spreading were however, reversed when BT-A6A cells were cultured in serum-free conditioned medium from the parental BT-549 cells which as shown in Fig. 1 contain AnxA6 (supplementary Fig. S4).Based on the differential attachment and spreading of BT-A6A cells on either fetuin-A- and fibronectin-coated cover slips (Fig. 3C), we next tested the attachment and spreading of BT-549 and BT-A6A cells on other extracellular matrix components. To do this these cell lines cells were cultured on fetuin-A, collagen type I, collagen type IV, laminin or Fibronectin-coated tissue culture plastics. Cells grown in serum-free medium (SFM) or complete medium (FBS) were used as controls. As shown in (Fig. 4A, a) and as expected the attachment of parental BT-549 cells in serum-free medium (SFM) was strongly attenuated but they efficiently attached and spread in complete medium (FBS) (Fig. 4A, b and b\u2019). Under similar conditions only about 30% of BT-A6A cells showed signs of spreading (seen as spindle-shaped cells) in complete medium but the cells remained rounded in serum-free medium (Fig. 4A, a\u2019). On fetuin-A-coated plates (FET) and as recently reported BT-549 cells were able to spread albeit less effectively compared to spreading in serum-supplemented medium. On the other hand, the spreading of BT-A6A cells on fetuin-A was virtually abolished (Fig. 4A, c and c\u2019). While adhesion and spreading of either parental BT-549 or BT-A6A cells onto collagen type I (Col I) was less efficient (Fig. 4A, d and d\u2019) both cell lines adhered and efficiently spread on fibronectin (Fig. 4A, f and f\u2019) and on laminin (data not shown). Interestingly, while BT-549 cells attached and spread on collagen type IV-coated plates (Col IV), BT-A6A cells grown on collagen type IV-coated plates remained mostly rounded (Fig. 4A, e and e\u2019). To verify that these cells were viable even though the AnxA6-depleted cells were rounded and/or loosely attached to the various substrata, the number and viability of the adhering cells were estimated using the alamar blue assay. Fig. 4B confirms that a greater number of BT-549 cells were retained in plates coated with FBS, collagen type IV and fibronectin and that the remaining rounded and/or spindle-shaped, BT-A6A cells were also viable compared with growth in serum-free medium. Together, this suggests that AnxA6 expression in motile/invasive breast cancer cells is necessary for efficient attachment to specific extracellular matrix components.Reduced expression of AnxA6 inhibits the motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cellsMost invasive breast cancer cells express low levels of E-cadherin and grow in 3D cultures on matrigel as branched or stellate colonies while the weakly invasive or non-invasive cell lines retain E-cadherin expression and grow either as fused colonies or as spherical colonies. In the following assays MCF-10A cells were used as negative control and the galectin-3 expressing BT-549 (BT-Gal3) cells previously shown to be less motile but more invasive than the parental BT-549 cells were used as the positive control. We first examined the expression of AnxA6 and epithelial-mesenchymal markers in these cells by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5A, lane 1, MCF-10A cells are N-cadherin and AnxA6-negative but as expected are E-cadherin positive. While the parental BT-549 and BT-Gal3 cells express similar levels of AnxA6, we consistently detected N-cadherin in BT-A6A cells (Fig. 5A, lane 4). We next tested the ability of BT-A6A cells to grow in 3D cultures in growth factor-reduced matrigel. As shown in Fig. 5B, unlike the parental BT-549 cells and BT-Gal3 cells which grow as branched or stellate colonies as previously shown, BT-A6A cells grew as spherical colonies similar to MCF-10A acini. This confirmed that depletion of AnxA6 in BT-549 cells promoted anchorage-independent cell growth but also abolished their invasiveness at least in vitro (Fig. 5B, cf. BT-549 and BT-A6A).To ascertain whether AnxA6 depletion affected cellular motility and invasiveness, cells were seeded in thin membrane cell culture inserts with or without a thin layer of matrigel using complete DMEM/F12 (10% FBS) as the chemoattractant. Fig. 5C shows that BT-A6A cells exhibited reduced (at least 20 fold) motility compared to the parental BT-549 cells. As expected, MCF-10A cells were negligibly motile while the BT-Gal3 cells were about 5-fold less motile than the parental cells (Fig. 5C). Analysis of the invasive potentials of these cells revealed that BT-A6A cells were again at least 8-fold less invasive while the BT-Gal3 cells were slightly more invasive than the parental BT-549 cells (Fig. 5D). Together, this suggests that AnxA6 expression is necessary for the motile/invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells and that the over-expression of N-cadherin, AnxA2 or AnxA4 (Fig. 2) was not sufficient to rescue the cells from the loss of AnxA6.AnxA6 expression is important for the localization of focal adhesions at appropriate plasma membrane sitesFrom the preceding observations, we speculated that AnxA6 might affect the formation and/or maturation of adherens junctions and adhesion plaques at cell-cell and cell-ECM contact sites respectively. We first, examined the formation of these structures by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin in parental cells cultivated at various Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 6A shows that parental BT-549 cells respond to an increase in extracellular Ca2+ by forming larger and more conspicuous adhesion plaques (arrow heads). To examine whether the reduced adhesion and motility of BT-A6A cells could be due to defective formation, localization and/or distribution of adhesion plaques, serum-starved cells were briefly treated with 2 mM Ca2+ and processed for visualization of vinculin-based adhesion plaques. As shown in Fig. 6B (arrow heads), the adhesion plaques in the parental BT-549 cells are conspicuous and peripherally located. In the spindle-shaped AnxA6-depleted cells these structures are not only fewer but are elongated, randomly distributed and concentrated at the tips of the cells (Fig. 6B, lower panel). A closer examination of the distribution of adhesion plaques at intercellular junctions (Fig. 6C, insets) in cells grown on glass cover slips in complete DMEM/F12 medium revealed discernible vinculin staining at intercellular junctions in the parental BT-549 cells (Fig. 6C, left panel). However, in BTA6A cells, the cell-cell contacts are not clearly demarcated by the vinculin structures (Fig. 6C, right panel). Together with data in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 this confirms that AnxA6 expression is required for the establishment of cell-cell cohesion as well as for cell-ECM interactions which are necessary for efficient motility and invasiveness of cancer cells.The Ca2+-dependent formation of adhesion plaques in BT-549 cells as shown in Fig. 6A prompted us to question whether the diminished cellular adhesion and motility following AnxA6 depletion could be due to defects in the generation of signals from focal adhesions. As shown in Fig. 7A, in the parental BT-549 cells and as expected, extracellular Ca2+ promoted the translocation of AnxA6 to membranes. To correlate the Ca2+-dependent formation of both adhesion plaques (Fig. 6A) and AnxA6 translocation to membranes with the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) known to be recruited to focal contacts, we investigated the effect of Ca2+ concentration on the autophosphorylation of FAK (phospho-Y397) in the parental BT-549 cells. Fig. 7B shows that the activation of FAK is indeed Ca2+-dependent; FAK autotophosphorylation is at least 3-fold at 5 mM Ca2+ compared to Ca2+-free conditions. We next, examined the effect of AnxA6 depletion on extracellular Ca2+-dependent activation of FAK, and the downstream signaling cascades involving PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways. To do this parental BT-549 and BT-A6A cells were treated with or without the indicated concentrations of Ca2+ for 10 min and the autophosphorylation of FAK or the activation of Akt (phospho-S473) and ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) were examined by western blotting in the respective cell lysates. We show that the activation of ERK1/2 is Ca2+-dependent in the parental BT-549 cells. On the contrary, in BT-A6A cells the activity of ERK1/2 is not responsive to Ca2+ (Fig. 7C and D). As depicted in Fig. 7C we consistently observed at least 2-fold up-regulation of the total ERK2 levels. While, the activation of FAK in parental BT-549 cells is Ca2+-dependent, it is strongly inhibited in BT-A6A cells (Fig 7C and E). We also observed that while PI3 kinase (depicted by phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt on S473) is activated in the parental BT-549 cells but its activation in BT-A6A cells is also strongly inhibited (Fig 7C and F). Together with data in figure 3, this suggests that the enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation of AnxA6-depleted cells is dependent on the constitutive activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway while AnxA6-dependent cellular adhesion and motility to a large extent appears to be modulated via the formation and appropriate localization of functional focal adhesions and the activation of the FAK-PI3 kinase/Akt pathway.AnxA6 expression is critical during the invasive stages of breast cancerOur data on the growth of BT-A6A cells in 2D and 3D cultures (Figs. 3 and 5) revealed that AnxA6 is necessary for cell-cell cohesion and cell motility/invasiveness but its diminished expression promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation. To correlate this with AnxA6 expression in breast cancer tissues, we examined its expression levels as well as the proliferative potential of cells in paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed normal breast, invasive ductal carcinoma and in mucous adenocarcinoma human breast tissues (US-Biomax Inc.). We show that AnxA6 expression is strongest in the ductal epithelial cells in normal mammary tissues; it is however, decreased to about 60% in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues and even more so (about 10%) in mucous adenocarcinoma tissues (Fig. 8A, upper panel and Fig. 8B). The immunohistochemical staining of PCNA revealed that while cell proliferation is barely detected in normal breast tissues, we observe more active proliferation in the invasive ductal carcinoma tissues (scored as 100%) and about 60% proliferation in mucous adenocarcinoma tissues (Fig. 8A, lower panel and Fig. 8B). Fig. 8C confirms that unlike MCF-10A, primary mammary epithelial cells (HuMEC) are AnxA6-positive. Expression of vinculin was not significantly different in the parental and AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells. Together, this demonstrates that although AnxA6 expression is reduced in breast cancer tissues, it remains relatively elevated in the invasive phenotype of breast cancer.DiscussionEarlier studies in our and other laboratories revealed that AnxA6 is a candidate receptor for fetuin-A on the surface of breast cancer cells and for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in several cell types. Since these extracellular AnxA6-interacting partners are potential cell adhesion molecules, AnxA6 may mediate the interaction of cells with these ECM components. On the other hand, the stabilization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton following constitutive membrane targeting of AnxA6 emphasizes the role of AnxA6 in cellular processes such as cell adhesion to the ECM and motility and perhaps their metastatic potentials. Another report that depletion of AnxA6 in the invasive MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells promoted anchorage-independent cell proliferation suggested yet another notion that AnxA6 might function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. The impetus for the present studies was therefore to address in greater detail this dichotomy in the role(s) of AnxA6 in breast cancer progression. Our data demonstrate that reduced AnxA6 expression contributes to breast cancer progression by promoting the loss of functional cell-cell and/or cell-ECM contacts and therefore enhanced anchorage-independent cell proliferation, presumably driven by sustained MAP kinase activation. Meanwhile, AnxA6-dependent cellular adhesion/motility may be driven by the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway due to the formation of functional focal adhesions at defined plasma membrane sites.Annexins are known to be intracellular proteins which efficiently interact with biological membranes. However, several proteomic studies have consistently identified AnxA2 and AnxA6 in cell-derived exosomes and on the surface of some cell types. It is believed that annexins reach the cell surface by translocating from the inner leaflet to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. There is also sufficient evidence that these signal peptide-less proteins associate with nanovesicles or multi-vesicular bodies and are released as exosomes. Our data show that these annexins are secreted by breast cancer cells via the exosomal pathway and that the secreted proteins are predominantly cell surface-associated. This more or less constitutive cell-surface association is supported by the fact that even at physiological Ca2+ concentrations (1.1-1.3 mM) extracellular annexins will almost entirely be membrane bound. The quantitative difference between cell surface expression of AnxA2 and AnxA6 in BT-549 and other cell types is not surprising because individual annexins require different Ca2+ concentrations for translocation to membranes and/or subsequent secretion in exosomes.Cell adhesion requires the interaction of cell surface receptors with their ECM ligands, followed by the clustering of adhesion receptors (cell spreading) and eventually the formation of adhesion plaques and actin stress fibers. Extracellular AnxA6 may influence this process through its interaction with extracellular ligands including the serum glycoprotein fetuin-A, chondroitin sulfate containing proteoglycans and as shown in this study, with the basement membrane collagen type IV. This receptor-ligand notion is supported by the demonstration that AnxA2 is the receptor for the matricellular protein tenascin-C as well as plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator. The interaction of AnxA2 with these ligands has been shown to affect cellular adhesion and migration. The interesting observation that AnxA6 might mediate the interaction of breast cancer cells with the basement membrane collagen type IV is indicative of a potential role of AnxA6 as a metastasis-promoting factor. If this is true, then AnxA6 may play an important role during the migration of invasive cancer cells into and out of the vasculature by enhancing the interaction of tumor cells with the basement membranes of the endothelium.The previous observation that AnxA6 expression is associated with divalent cation-dependent endothelial cell adhesion of metastatic RAW117 large-cell lymphoma cells suggests that cell surface AnxA6 may directly mediate celI-cell interactions. In support of this putative function, annexins have been shown to self-aggregate on membrane surfaces in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This possibly occurs via the formation of \u201cannexin bridges\u201d between adjacent cells via their conserved domains. It is possible that AnxA6 with two sets of 4 annexin repeats may be more efficient at forming such annexin bridges than either AnxA2 or other annexins with a single set of 4 annexin repeats. This again explains why in spite of over expression of AnxA2 and AnxA4 in AnxA6-depleted cells, the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions were not significantly overcome. This is supported by studies in which down regulation of AnxA1, AnxA2 or AnxA5 in various cancer cell types influenced cell motility via distinct mechanisms and suggests that these proteins are not functionally redundant.The motile phenotype of breast cancer cells is often associated with loss of E-cadherin and expression of N-cadherin. The surprising observation that N-cadherin is up-regulated in the adhesion and motility-impaired AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells support yet another idea that AnxA6 is required for cadherin function in cell-cell contacts. Although AnxA6 involvement remains to be verified, this possibility is consistent with a recent report in which AnxA2 was identified as a component of the vascular endothelial cell cadherin complex. It is worth noting that over-expression of N-cadherin in motility-impaired cells has also been reported in LN18 glioblastoma cells following transfection with a dominant negative HER2 receptor variant.Although other protein-AnxA6 interactions are possible, the demonstrated mode of association of AnxA6 with cell membranes is via membrane phospholipids. As such AnxA6 participates in the formation of membrane-cytoskeleton complexes and in a Ca2+-dependent manner. It should be recalled that focal contacts are actin-anchoring sites and recent studies confirmed that AnxA6 stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton. This supports the notion that like extracellular AnxA6 discussed above, intracellular AnxA6 also acts as a link between the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, although we could not demonstrate the presence of AnxA6 in focal contacts, it is possible that AnxA6 indirectly stabilizes focal contacts at appropriate plasma membrane locations via its interaction with F-actin. It is also likely that AnxA6 does not influence the formation of vinculin-based focal contacts per se, but loss of AnxA6 expression may prevent the anchoring of these structures at appropriate locations in the plasma membrane. The requirement of AnxA6 in this process is supported by the altered cellular morphology as well as the elongated structure and dispersed localization of adhesion plaques following AnxA6 depletion in BT-549 cells.This study enhances our understanding of two potential roles of AnxA6 in breast cancer progression viz. as a tumor suppressor and as a motility promoting factor. From our data it appears that in breast cancer, AnxA6 expression reduces as the disease progresses. Loss of AnxA6 has been linked with inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry, impaired membrane targeting of p120GAP which negatively regulates Ras activity and therefore, sustained activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. This sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway appears to be a major contributing factor in enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation of AnxA6-depleted cells and therefore, enhanced tumor growth. Cell adhesion and motility/invasion on the other hand depend upon efficient reorganization of the cytoskeleton and more precisely on the propensity for rapid assembly and disassembly of cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts. This has been shown to be driven by the FAK-dependent activation of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. Our data also reveal that the underlying cause for the inhibition of adhesion-related properties of AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells is the inappropriate localization and/or functional integrity of focal contacts at sites of contact with the ECM and/or between cells. The defective focal contacts and the strong inhibition of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway suggest that AnxA6-dependent adhesion and motility of invasive breast cancer cells rely on the activation of the FAK-PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. Therefore, while reduced AnxA6 expression is necessary for enhanced tumor growth via anchorage-independent cell proliferation, AnxA6 expression is required for cellular adhesion, motility and invasiveness.Supplementary MaterialThis is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

        "content": "The influence of various normal and malignant human cells on the level of collagen synthesis by human fibroblasts was tested in coculture. As revealed by immunoperoxidase staining, in cocultures with breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7, SA52, T47D) fibroblasts synthesized collagen while tumor cells did not. Fibroblasts displayed increased collagen production without change in the overall protein synthesis. Several other types of cells derived from normal human tissues (keratinocytes, normal mammary cells) or from fibrosarcoma, melanoma, cervical carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, or other breast adenocarcinoma (SW613, MDA, BT20) did not affect collagen synthesis of fibroblasts. Although to a lesser extent, this stimulating effect was reproduced by using the conditioned medium (CM) of the active cells but not with CM of the other cell types. A slight stimulation was also obtained when tumoral MCF7 cells and fibroblasts shared the same medium but were physically separated, suggesting that close contact was required for optimal stimulation of collagen synthesis. The collagen synthesis stimulating activity was not related to a modification of fibroblast proliferation rate. The production of collagen types I, III, and VI and fibronectin were increased in cocultures of fibroblasts with MCF7 cells. The increased synthesis of collagen types I and III and fibronectin was paralleled by similar changes in the steady-state level of their mRNAs. On the contrary, the increased production of collagen type VI appeared regulated at a post-transcriptional level.",

        "title": "Tumor stroma-containing 3D spheroid arrays: A tool to study nanoparticle penetration.",
        "content": "Nanoparticle penetration through tumor tissue after extravasation is considered as a key issue for tumor distribution and therapeutic effects. Most tumors possess abundant stroma, a fibrotic tissue composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a barrier for nanoparticle penetration. There is however a lack of suitable in vitro systems to study the tumor stroma penetration of nanoparticles. In the present study, we developed and thoroughly characterized a 3D co-culture spheroidal array to mimic tumor stroma and investigated the penetration of silica and PLGA nanoparticles in these spheroids. First, we examined human breast tumor patient biopsies to characterize the content and organization of stroma and found a high expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; 40% positive area) and collagen-1 (50% positive area). Next, we prepared homospheroids of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts alone as well as heterospheroids combining 3T3 and 4T1 cells in different ratios (1:1 and 5:1) using a microwell array platform. Confocal live imaging revealed that fibroblasts distributed and reorganized within 48h in heterospheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and gene expression analysis showed a proportional increase of \u03b1-SMA and collagen in heterospheroids with higher fibroblast ratios attaining 35% and 45% positive area at 5:1 (3T3:4T1) ratio, in a good match with the clinical breast tumor stroma. Subsequently, we studied the penetration of high and low negatively charged fluorescent silica nanoparticles (30nm; red and 100 or 70nm; green; zeta potential: -40mV and -20mV) and as well as Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles (200nm, -7mV) in both homo- and heterospheroid models. Fluorescent microscopy on spheroid cryosections after incubation with silica nanoparticles showed that 4T1 homospheroids allowed a high penetration of about 75-80% within 24h, with higher penetration in case of the 30nm nanoparticles. In contrast, spheroids with increasing fibroblast amounts significantly inhibited NP penetration. Silica nanoparticles with a less negative zeta potential exhibited lesser penetration compared to highly negative charged nanoparticles. Subsequently, similar experiments were conducted using Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles and confocal laser scanning microscopy; an increased nanoparticle penetration was found in 4T1 homospheroids until 48h, but significantly lower penetration in heterospheroids. Furthermore, we also developed human homospheroids (MDA-MB-231 or Panc-1 tumor cells) and heterospheroids (MDA-MB-231/BJ-hTert and Panc-1/pancreatic stellate cells) and performed silica nanoparticle (30 and 100nm) penetration studies. As a result, heterospheroids had significantly a lesser penetration of the nanoparticles compared to homospheroids. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that tumor stroma acts as a strong barrier for nanoparticle penetration. The 30-nm nanoparticles with low zeta potential favor deeper penetration. Furthermore, the herein proposed 3D co-culture platform that mimics the tumor stroma, is ideally suited to systematically investigate the factors influencing the penetration characteristics of newly developed nanomedicines to allow the design of nanoparticles with optimal penetration characteristics.",

        "content": "Fibroblasts are among the most abundant stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), progressively differentiating into activated, motile, myofibroblast-like, protumorigenic cells referred to as Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). To investigate the mechanisms by which epithelial cells direct this transition, the early stages of tumorigenesis were exemplified by indirect cocultures of WI-38 or human primary breast cancer fibroblasts with human mammary epithelial cells expressing an inducible c-Myc oncogene (MCF10A-MycER). After c-Myc activation, the conditioned medium (CM) of MCF10A-MycER cells significantly enhanced fibroblast activation and mobilization. As this was accompanied by decreased insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 (IGFBP-6) and increased insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGF-II (IGF-I, IGF-II) in the CM, IGFs were investigated as key chemotactic factors. Silencing IGFBP-6 or IGF-I or IGF-II expression in epithelial cells or blocking Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) activity on fibroblasts significantly altered fibroblast mobilization. Exposure of WI-38 fibroblasts to CM from induced MCF10A-MycER cells or to IGF-II upregulated FAK phosphorylation on Tyr<sup397</sup , as well as the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), features associated with CAF phenotype and increased cell migratory/invasive behavior. In three-dimensional (3D)-organotypic assays, WI-38 or human primary fibroblasts, preactivated with either CM from MCF10A-MycER cells or IGFs, resulted in a permissive TME that enabled nontransformed MCF10A matrix invasion. This effect was abolished by inhibiting IGF-1R activity. Thus, breast epithelial cell oncogenic activation and stromal fibroblast transition to CAFs are linked through the IGFs/IGF-1R axis, which directly promotes TME remodeling and increases tumor invasion.",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min. Upper panels, representative images of adherent cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panel, adhesion was quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm). Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay. Left panels, representative images of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 wound healing over time (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a016\u2009h) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm. Right panel, wound healing (wound width, in \u03bcm) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) was quantified over time. The data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment. (D) Cell invasion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroids embedded in collagen I gel were let to invade in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 3\u2009days. Left panels, representative images of invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Right panel, the invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell area was quantified using Image J. Data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test).DISCUSSIONHere, we showed that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed in both tumor and stromal cells, and that its expression in CAFs independently predicts RFS in patients with TNBC. Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "Chemotherapy is an important comprehensive treatment for breast cancer, which targets micro-environment of tumors as well as their characterisitcs. A previous microarray analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 was highly upregulated in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) prior to and following treatment with Taxotere under co-culture conditions. However, whether the chemotherapeutic effects of Taxotere were influenced by the changes in MMP-1 remained unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact and mechanism of CAFs in regulating the efficacy of Taxotere on breast cancer cells. CAFs isolated from primary invasive ductal human breast tumors following surgical resection, were used in co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells to simulate the tumor micro-environment. Following the addition of Taxotere, changes in MMP-1 gene and protein expression were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Proliferation, invasion and apoptosis assays revealed that when MMP-1 was upregulated in CAFs, the therapeutic efficacy of Taxotere was reduced in breast cancer cells. Chemosensitivity was significantly increased when MMP-1 expression was inhibited by GM6001. In addition, Collagen IV was upregulated in CAFs following chemotherapy and protected breast cancer cells against chemotherapeutic side effects. Collagen IV expression significantly decreased, as well as MMP-1 expression when GM6001 was added. Proliferation and invasion assays demonstrated that the exogenous addition of Collagen IV weakend the chemotherapeutic effect of Taxotere on breast tumor cells. Overall, the results revealed that in CAFs, MMP-1 synergized with Collagen IV as a key gene in regulating the chemotherapeutic effect of Taxotere on breast tumor cells and served an important role in reducing the efficacy of Taxotere on breast cancer, potentially via the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling pathway. These fidings provide a theoretical basis for the mechanism of CAFs in reducing the chemotherapeutic effect of Taxotere on breast cancer cells and a novel approach for enhancing the chemosensitivity of tumors.",

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

        "content": "Breast cancer cells oversecrete the lysosomal peptidase cathepsin D as a pro-enzyme. In this study, we assessed the effect of media conditioned by MRC-5 fibroblasts or MCF-7/6 breast cancer cells on cathepsin D (CD) production and secretion by these two cell types. We also considered the influence of estrogens and matrix components (type I or type IV collagen, or Matrigel) on the expression and activity of CD produced by breast cancer cells of different invasive potentials (MCF-7/AZ, MCF-7/6, MDA-MB-231). In our system, fibroblasts conditioned medium does not significantly affect CD levels produced and secreted by the MCF-7/6 cells. However, we found that fibroblasts are able to capture the pro-CD secreted by these tumor cells by a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent process. We also found a positive correlation between the proportion of extracellular CD levels and the invasive potentials of the tumor cell types considered. If estrogens are able to upregulate CD production and secretion by receptor-positive cells, it is not the case of extracellular matrix components. On the other hand, our results indicate that matrix components are able to influence the distribution of the different CD forms in and out of the cells. Our data suggest that tumor fibroblasts, by enhancing their intracellular CD levels, could assist cancer cells in the digestion of extracellular matrix during the invasion of tissues.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "We have previously demonstrated that fibroblasts and invasive human breast carcinoma (HBC) cells specifically activate matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) when cultured on 3-dimensional gels of type I collagen but not a range of other substrates. We show here the constitutive expression of membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP in both fibroblasts, and invasive HBC cell lines, that have fibroblastic attributes presumably acquired through an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Treatment with collagen type I increased the steady-state MT1-MMP mRNA levels in these cells but did not induce either MT1-MMP expression or MMP-2 activation in noninvasive breast carcinoma cell lines, which retain epithelial features. Basal MT3-MMP mRNA expression had a pattern similar to that of MT1-MMP but was not up-regulated by collagen. MT4-MMP mRNA was seen in both invasive and noninvasive HBC cell lines and was also not collagen-regulated, and MT2-MMP mRNA was not detected in any of the HBC cell lines tested. These data support a role for MT1-MMP in the collagen-induced MMP-2-activation seen in these cells. In situ hybridization analysis of archival breast cancer specimens revealed a close parallel in expression of both collagen type I and MT1-MMP mRNA in peritumoral fibroblasts, which was correlated with aggressiveness of the lesion. Relatively high levels of expression of both mRNA species were seen in fibroblasts close to invasive tumor nests and, although only focally, in certain areas close to preinvasive tumors. These foci may represent hot spots for local degradation and invasive progression. Collectively, these results implicate MT1-MMP in collagen-stimulated MMP-2 activation and suggest that this mechanism may be employed in vivo by both tumor-associated fibroblasts and EMT-derived carcinoma cells to facilitate increased invasion and/or metastasis.",

This interaction regulates extracellular matrix mechanosensing, and in its absence, mesenchymal cells gain the ability to grow on soft matrices.Both cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix adhesions are regulated by mechanical signals, but the mechanobiological processes that mediate the cross talk between these structures are poorly understood. Here we show that \u03b1-catenin, a mechanosensitive protein that is classically linked with cadherin-based adhesions, associates with and regulates integrin adhesions. \u03b1-Catenin is recruited to the edges of mesenchymal cells, where it interacts with F-actin. This is followed by mutual retrograde flow of \u03b1-catenin and F-actin from the cell edge, during which \u03b1-catenin interacts with vinculin within integrin adhesions. This interaction affects adhesion maturation, stress-fiber assembly, and force transmission to the matrix. In epithelial cells, \u03b1-catenin is present in cell\u2013cell adhesions and absent from cell\u2013matrix adhesions. However, when these cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, \u03b1-catenin transitions to the cell edge, where it facilitates proper mechanosensing. This is highlighted by the ability of \u03b1-catenin\u2013depleted cells to grow on soft matrices. These results suggest a dual role of \u03b1-catenin in mechanosensing, through both cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix adhesions.IntroductionThe ability of cells to sense and respond to their immediate environment affects the most fundamental cellular functions, including as survival, proliferation, and migration. This sensing ability relies on direct physical interactions with neighboring cells or with the ECM through cell adhesion molecules\u2014cadherins and integrins, respectively. The balance and transition between these two types of interactions can determine the state of a cell, as in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanisms of interplay between cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix adhesions remain poorly understood.Cell\u2013cell contacts are classically mediated by adherens junctions (AJs), which are composed of transmembrane E-cadherin molecules and the catenin family of proteins\u2014p120-catenin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b1-catenin\u2014that bind as a complex to the cytoplasmic tails of the cadherins. \u03b1-Catenin is an actin-binding protein, and its ability to mediate the connection between cadherin and F-actin is vital for AJs, as actomyosin-based forces are required for stabilizing the cadherin\u2013cadherin connection. In this process, \u03b1-catenin acts as a mechanosensory protein that responds to the applied forces in the form of structural changes that occur in its C-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) and in its M-domain. The M-domain recruits numerous adhesion-related proteins, including ZO-1, afadin, \u03b1-actinin, and vinculin. Notably, the latter two are also important mediators of the connection between integrins and F-actin within focal adhesions (FAs), suggesting a possible involvement of \u03b1-catenin in these structures. Previous studies have suggested a role for \u03b1-catenin outside of cell\u2013cell adhesions, but whether \u03b1-catenin plays a role in regulating cell\u2013matrix adhesions and ECM mechanosensing is unknown.Here we show that in mesenchymal cells, \u03b1-catenin is recruited to the cell edge, where it interacts with F-actin in regions devoid of \u03b1-actinin. It then undergoes retrograde flow together with F-actin toward the cell center and interacts with vinculin within integrin adhesions. This interaction mediates adhesion maturation, enhances force transmission to the matrix, and drives the proper assembly of actin stress fibers. We find that while the loss of \u03b1-catenin is not sufficient to induce EMT on its own, it does play a role in rigidity-dependent EMT induced by TGF\u03b2. Importantly, after EMT, \u03b1-catenin transitions to the edges of the cells, where it facilitates mechanosensing. Moreover, the absence of the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction causes mesenchymal cells to display impaired adhesion to the matrix. This results in aberrant mechanosensing of the matrix and the transformation of cells to being rigidity independent for growth.Results and discussion\u03b1-Catenin localizes to the edges of fibroblast cellsSince \u03b1-catenin was shown to be recruited to mesenchymal cell edges, we postulated that it might play a role in regulating integrin adhesions that assemble in those regions. To test this, we first verified the recruitment of \u03b1-catenin to the cell edges of three different fibroblast cell lines: RPTP\u03b1+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), NIH3T3 cells, and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). We plated the cells sparsely on fibronectin (FN)-coated coverslips to prevent the formation of cell\u2013cell contacts and fixed them after 15 min of spreading. We confirmed by immunostaining that in 50\u201360% of these cells, \u03b1-catenin was localized in lamellipodial regions (typically presented as narrow stripes at the cell edge; \u223c500 nm for MEF and NIH3T3, \u223c1,200 nm for HFF; Fig. 1 A).\u03b1-Catenin localizes in the lamellipodium at early times of cell spreading. (A) Representative images of three fibroblast cell lines immunostained for \u03b1-catenin after 15 min of spreading on FN-coated coverslips (left), along with the width of the catenin band at the cell edge, represented by full width half maximum (FWHM; center), and the percentage of cells from each fibroblast cell line with catenin at the cell-edge (right; n = 30 cells in each case). (B) WT MEFs costained for \u03b1-catenin and F-actin (phalloidin); the right panel is a zoom-in of the box in the left image, showing \u03b1-catenin stripes that coincide with stress fibers; the graphs on the right are the normalized intensities of phalloidin (magenta) and \u03b1-catenin (green) measured along the yellow lines in the merged image. (C) WT MEF costained for actin, \u03b1-catenin, and vinculin; right panel images are zoom-ins of the boxes in the merged image, showing vinculin and \u03b1-catenin in cell-matrix (top) and cell\u2013cell (bottom) adhesions. (D) Zoom-in on the edge of a WT MEF cell costained for \u03b1-catenin and vinculin.Next, we set out to characterize the interaction of \u03b1-catenin with its known binding partners in AJs\u2014F-actin, \u03b1-actinin, and vinculin\u2014in mesenchymal cells, as they are all key players in integrin adhesions. To that end, we used the MEFs, which typically express high levels of the \u03b1E-catenin isoform (Fig. S1 A). Notably, the recruitment of \u03b1-catenin to the cell edge was independent of vinculin and \u03b1-actinin, as their depletion from the cells did not affect \u03b1-catenin localization (Fig. S1 B). Costaining the cells for \u03b1-catenin and F-actin showed that they were often colocalized at the cell edge at early stages of cell spreading (Fig. 1 B). Closer examination of cell centers also revealed striped patterns of \u03b1-catenin that coincided with actin stress fibers in the majority of analyzed cells (although these patterns were sometimes obscured by cytoplasmic staining; Figs. 1 B and S1 C). We then costained the cells for \u03b1-catenin, \u03b1-actinin, and F-actin. Consistent with previous studies, after 15 min of cell spreading, \u03b1-actinin appeared in nascent adhesion sites and was also recruited to the cell edges, where it was colocalized with F-actin (Fig. S2 A). However, closer examination of high-resolution confocal images showed that \u03b1-catenin and \u03b1-actinin were not colocalized at the cell edges (Fig. S2 B). Similarly, at later time points, these two proteins were not colocalized on actin stress fibers (Fig. S2 C). Thus, \u03b1-actinin and \u03b1-catenin overlaid actin filaments in a non-overlapping manner.\u03b1-Catenin colocalizes with F-actin. (A) RT-PCR analyses show that MEF and MDCK cells (used later in this study, see Fig. 5) express almost exclusively \u03b1E-catenin and not \u03b1N-catenin. (B) Immunostaining for \u03b1-catenin in vinculin\u2212/\u2212 cells and \u03b1-actinin KD MEFs shows that its recruitment to the cell edge is not impaired by the absence of either of these proteins. (C) Immunostaining for \u03b1-catenin (green) in MEFs fixed 4 h after plating on FN-coated glass shows colocalization with F-actin (magenta) on stress fibers (bottom zoom-in) as well as at the cell edge (top zoom-in). The brightness of the top rectangle in the zoomed-out image was enhanced for the purpose of clarity.\u03b1-Catenin and \u03b1-actinin do not colocalize. (A) Immunostaining in WT MEFs for \u03b1-actinin shows its colocalization after 15 min of spreading with F-actin at the cell edge (yellow arrow) as well as its localization in nascent adhesions (white arrow). (B) Zoom-in on the edge of a WT MEF cell costained for actin, \u03b1-actinin, \u03b1-catenin, showing lack of overlap of the latter two.

Bottom row is the zoom-in of the boxes in the top row; arrows point to locations in which \u03b1-catenin is localized but \u03b1-actinin is not. (D) Frame from a video of a cell expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin and mCherry-\u03b1-actinin showing that the two are not colocalized; and kymographs taken from the yellow line (D\u2032).We next turned to test the relative distributions of \u03b1-catenin and vinculin. In cells that displayed nascent vinculin adhesions at the cell edge, we found similar distributions of \u03b1-catenin, although colocalization was partial (Fig. 1 C). Also, in some cells that displayed mature vinculin adhesions 1\u20133 \u00b5m away from the \u03b1-catenin\u2013rich cell edges, we observed \u03b1-catenin patches extending from the edges toward these adhesions (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that \u03b1-catenin was flowing from the cell edges toward integrin adhesions and interacting with them. This was observed in a relatively small number of cases, suggesting that such an interaction might be transient and would be better detected by live-cell imaging.\u03b1-Catenin undergoes retrograde flow with F-actin and interacts with integrin adhesionsTo further explore the relationship of \u03b1-catenin with F-actin, vinculin, and \u03b1-actinin in the context of the lamellipodium and integrin adhesions, we performed live-cell imaging of MEFs on FN-coated coverslips. Tracking the dynamics of WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin along with the F-actin marker tdTomato-Tractin showed that the two markers were predominantly colocalized and displayed the same protrusion-retraction cycles at the cell edge (Fig. 2, A and A\u2032; and Video 1). Moreover, GFP-\u03b1-catenin displayed the same flow patterns as F-actin from the cell edge inwards and decorated actin stress fibers as they gradually grew over time (Video 1). Consistent with the immunostaining results, imaging of live cells coexpressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin and mCherry-\u03b1-actinin showed that they did not overlap (Video 2). In particular, during protrusion-retraction cycles, when \u03b1-actinin was associated with the protrusion phase, \u03b1-catenin was associated with the retraction phase, and vice versa (Fig. S2, D and D\u2032). Thus, \u03b1-catenin and \u03b1-actinin do not interact within the context of cell edge dynamics and integrin adhesions.\u03b1-Catenin flows from the cell edge with actin and vinculin. (A and A\u2032) Frame from a video of a cell expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin and td-Tomato-Tractin showing colocalization of actin and \u03b1-catenin at the edge; and kymographs taken from the yellow line (A\u2032).

(B and B\u2032) Average of six frames (equivalent to 2 min) from a video of a cell expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin and mCherry-vinculin showing colocalization at the edge as well as in mature adhesions (arrow); and kymographs taken from the yellow line (B\u2032). The chart on the right shows quantifications of the flow rates of \u03b1-catenin and vinculin in adhesions (n = 24 adhesions in each case).

Playback, 30 fps.Time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy of an \u03b1-catenin KD MEF expressing mCherry-\u03b1-actinin (magenta) and WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin (green). Images were acquired every 30 s for 36.5 min. Playback, 20 fps.In contrast, imaging of live cells coexpressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin and mCherry-vinculin showed that they had similar dynamics and flow patterns. In particular, \u03b1-catenin colocalized with vinculin within adhesions that were growing and sliding from the cell edge toward the center (Fig. 2 B\u2032 and Video 3), suggesting a specific interaction between \u03b1-catenin and maturing FAs. Indeed, temporal averaging of GFP-\u03b1-catenin videos revealed patterns of \u03b1-catenin expression that matched the localization of FAs situated 1\u20133 \u00b5m inwards from the cell edge (Fig. 2 B).Time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy of an \u03b1-catenin KD MEF expressing mCherry-vinculin (magenta) and WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin (green). Images were acquired every 20 s for 120 min. Playback, 20 fps. The white arrows follow maturing FAs.\u03b1-Catenin interacts with vinculin in FAsTo further explore the interaction between \u03b1-catenin and FAs, we next tested whether a specific connection between \u03b1-catenin and vinculin was an underlying reason for their similar flow patterns. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) showed a direct association between the two proteins, which was lost upon \u03b1-catenin knockdown (KD) and restored upon expression of WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin (Fig. S3 A). We therefore used a variant of GFP-\u03b1-catenin containing a lysine-to-proline mutation at site 344 (L344P) that displays drastically diminished binding to vinculin. We expressed this variant, along with tdTomato-Tractin or mCherry-vinculin, in \u03b1-catenin KD MEFs and performed live-cell tracking of the cells. This revealed stark differences in the \u03b1-catenin and adhesion dynamics compared with those detected in WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin cells. First, in \u223c61% of the analyzed L344P mutant cells (14 of n = 23 cells), stable adhesions failed to form, and as a result the cell edges did not stabilize following protrusions, leading to extensive ruffling (Fig. 3 A and Video 4). This was confirmed using live bright-field imaging of early cell spreading in which \u03b1-catenin KD cells and L344P mutant cells displayed extensive ruffling compared with WT controls (Videos 5, 6, 7, and 8 and Fig. S3 B). Second, in \u223c26% of the cells, the cell edges were able to stabilize without the formation of lamellipodia, and instead the cells spread by projecting narrow protrusions (Fig. 3 B). However, even though relatively stable vinculin-containing adhesions were present in such protrusions, these adhesions rarely slid toward the cell center, despite the observed retrograde flow of GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P on top of them (Fig. 3 B and Video 9). Rather, the GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P flow rate was considerably higher than that of mCherry-vinculin in these adhesions (12.4 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 6.4 \u00b1 0.7 nm/s; n = 20 for each; Fig. 3 B and Video 9). Finally, at the cellular level, GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P was often located on actin stress fibers that were attached to vinculin adhesions, but unlike cells expressing WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin, the stress fibers were highly contractile and dynamic (Fig. 3, C and D; and Video 10). This led to the perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton organization, which was initially characterized by the aggregation of GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P along with F-actin at the cell center (such thick perinuclear actin bundles were observed in \u223c75% of the videos analyzed). Fixation of the cells following overnight incubation and staining for F-actin revealed that over time, these bundles frequently collapsed, as evident by the appearance of dense wavy structures at the cell center (Fig. 3 E). This was in contrast to WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin, which rarely (<5%) formed perinuclear actin bundles and appeared primarily at the cell edges (in 85% of the cells, n = 20 cells) and on stress fibers (although this was often obscured by cytoplasmic localization of the construct; \u223c60% of the cells; Fig. 3 E).\u03b1-Catenin regulates cell edge protrusion-retraction\u00a0cycles and cytoskeletal organization.

Playback, 25 fps.Notably, the enhanced localization of the L344P mutant in regions rich with actin stress fibers suggested that it could bind actin more efficiently compared with WT \u03b1-catenin. To test this, we expressed a GFP-labeled fragment of \u03b1-catenin corresponding to its ABD (amino acids 680\u2013906) in the cells. Also, as proline is known to induce bending within \u03b1-helices, we considered that the L344P mutation could potentially disrupt the structure of the second \u03b1-helix present in the MI domain of \u03b1-catenin, thereby giving rise to unknown structural changes in other areas of the protein. Hence, to verify that the observed effects of the L344P mutation were not due to \u03b1-catenin misfolding, we added a mutant form of GFP-\u03b1-catenin in which the lysine at position 344 was replaced by alanine (GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344A). Staining the cells for F-actin showed that in the majority of the transfected cells (>80%, n = 20 cells in each case), the two mutated forms of \u03b1-catenin displayed similar behavior to that of the L344P variant and were localized on stress fibers and in central regions of the cells, in the form of perinuclear actin bundles (Fig. 3 F). Taken together, the enhanced contrast between stress fiber and cytoplasmic localization of the three mutant forms, combined with the formation of irregular actin bundles in the presence of these mutants, suggest that \u201cfree\u201d \u03b1-catenin with an active ABD can bind efficiently to stress fibers, potentially affecting their contractility. Interestingly, similar bundling was caused by the L344P and L344A mutants when expressed in vinculin\u2212/\u2212 MEFs (Fig. S3 C), indicating that \u03b1-catenin is primarily recruited to F-actin.Collectively, these results demonstrate that the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction is necessary for normal cell spreading, regular protrusion/retraction cycles of the cell edge, sliding of integrin adhesions, and orderly formation of actin stress fibers. The mechanism by which the L344P mutant leads stress fibers to become highly contractile and aggregated at the cell center is not clear and should be addressed in future studies. One possibility is that the mere presence of \u03b1-catenin enhances stress fiber contractility; hence, the sequestration of \u03b1-catenin by vinculin in the adhesions could prevent excess \u03b1-catenin translocation into the stress fibers, thereby attenuating excess contractility. Another possibility is that the poor connection between stress fibers and FAs in the presence of the L344P mutant inhibits the transmission of the contractile forces to the ECM, thereby leading to enhanced deformation of the stress fibers themselves, as predicted by our recent study.The \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction enhances force transmission to the matrix and FA maturationThe results described above indicate that vinculin may act as a clutch that engages with \u03b1-catenin within integrin adhesions as the latter is bound to actin fibers. Indeed, introducing the L344P mutation in \u03b1-catenin KD MEFs caused a noticeable disconnect between the respective flows of \u03b1-catenin and vinculin (compare Figs. 2 B and 3 B). Quantification of the flow rates within adhesions showed that the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction attenuated the \u03b1-catenin flow by approximately twofold (12.4 \u00b1 1.1 and 6.3 \u00b1 0.6 nm/s for L344P and WT \u03b1-catenin, respectively; n = 15 each), thus reinforcing the idea that the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction acts as a clutch. Because stronger integrin\u2013actin engagement leads to more efficient force transmission, we next set out to test the effect of the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction on force transmission to the matrix. To that end, we plated the cells on arrays of FN-coated pillars and measured the time-dependent deformation of the pillars as a measure of force transmission. As shown in Fig. 4 A, WT MEFs gradually displaced the pillars over a period of \u223c10 min, until they reached a plateau of \u223c120 nm. In agreement with the adhesion maturation results, the \u03b1-catenin KD cells displayed a significant decrease in matrix deformation (maximal displacement of \u223c40 nm). Furthermore, WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin expression in \u03b1-catenin KD cells restored pillar displacement almost completely (maximal displacement of \u223c100 nm), whereas GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P expression did not (Fig. 4 A). These results strengthen the notion that \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin binding is a crucial clutch element within adhesions that is required for proper contractile activity and force transmission into the matrix.\u03b1-Catenin affects force transmission and adhesion maturation.

Statistical analysis of the adhesions, cell areas, cell heights, and cell motility (C\u2013H) were tested by ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001).As the growth of nascent adhesions into mature FAs is a force-dependent process, we next sought to test the role of \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interactions in FA maturation. To that end, we stained the cells for vinculin and F-actin after 6 h of spreading and found that whereas WT MEFs formed mature vinculin-containing FAs, \u03b1-catenin KD cells mostly did not display mature vinculin adhesions and had almost exclusively small adhesions (\u201cfocal complexes\u201d) at the cell edge (Fig. 4, B and C). In line with the reduction in mature adhesions, \u03b1-catenin KD cells failed to spread out and flatten, as evident by their reduced area (Fig. 4 D) and increased height (Fig. 4 E) compared with WT cells. Similarly, knocking down \u03b1-catenin in NIH3T3 cells resulted in the formation of small adhesions and a decrease in cell spreading (Fig. S4, A\u2013C). Expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin in the \u03b1-catenin KD MEFs restored the formation of mature FAs, while expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P or L344A in the same cells did not (Fig. 4, B and C). Similar results were obtained when staining for zyxin (Fig. S4 D), a marker for mature FAs, confirming that the observed lack of mature vinculin-containing adhesions was not due to a lack of vinculin recruitment into mature adhesions, but rather due to the absence of such adhesions altogether. Furthermore, \u03b1-catenin KD cells and cells expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P or L344A were significantly smaller (Fig. 4 D) and less flat (Fig. 4 E) than WT cells or cells expressing WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin, which is consistent with their inability to form mature adhesions. To further test the relevance of the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction in the regulation of integrin adhesions, we used Matrigel (basement membrane\u2013like) matrices, which were recently shown to induce the sliding of adhesions from the cell edge toward the center, resulting in highly elongated adhesions around the nucleus. We plated the cells on Matrigel-coated coverslips and stained them for vinculin after overnight incubation. This revealed that WT MEFs and WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin MEFs formed a significantly higher number of sliding adhesions than the \u03b1-catenin KD cells and cells expressing GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P (Fig. S4 E).\u03b1-Catenin regulates adhesion maturation.

Statistical analysis for the NIH3T3 cell area and number of adhesions was performed with two-tailed unpaired t test followed by Welch\u2019s correction. Statistical analysis of the number of sliding adhesions was performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test correction (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01). Source data are available for this figure: SourceData FS4.Next, we expressed an \u03b1-catenin variant in which valine 796\u2014a key residue within the ABD\u2014was replaced by alanine (V796A), as this mutant is known to reduce the binding of \u03b1-catenin to actin (; see Fig. S4 F for verification of the expression levels of the mutant forms of \u03b1-catenin). Cells expressing this mutant showed results (Fig. 4, B\u2013E) similar to those of the \u03b1-catenin KD cells and the other mutants, confirming that the actin-binding ability of \u03b1-catenin is important for adhesion maturation. Interestingly, single-cell motility assays showed that \u03b1-catenin KD cells and cells expressing the L344P mutant were more motile than the WT controls, as evident by their increased distances and velocities (Fig. 4 F). In contrast, V796A mutant cells displayed a motility phenotype similar to that of WT controls (Fig. 4 F), despite displaying adhesion and cell size phenotypes comparable to the KD and L344P cells (Fig. 4, C\u2013E). This disengagement of phenotypes points to a complex relationship between the strength of \u03b1-catenin\u2013F-actin binding, adhesion reinforcement, and cell migration, which should be investigated in more depth in future studies.As a major axis of vinculin recruitment to FAs is through its binding to talin, we set out to test the effects of this interaction on adhesion growth in the context of the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction. To that end, we transfected vinculin\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with WT mCherry-vinculin or mCherry-vinculin-A50I, a mutant form of vinculin that has reduced binding to talin compared with WT vinculin, but is still recruited to adhesions. We coexpressed WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin or GFP-\u03b1-catenin-L344P constructs in these cells. As expected, the A50I mutation led to the formation of less mature adhesions compared with WT vinculin (Fig. 4 G). Moreover, coexpression with the L344P mutant led to a further decrease in adhesion sizes, which was accompanied by a reduction in cell area (Fig. 4 H). These results indicate that once vinculin is recruited to adhesions (through talin or other adhesion proteins), its interaction with \u03b1-catenin is essential for the regulation of adhesion maturation and cell spreading.Taken together, these results show that the \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction plays a critical role in integrin adhesion regulation, constituting an important addition to the classic adhesion maturation model through the talin-vinculin module. In this process, forces that are transmitted through the adhesions lead to stretching of the talin molecules, thereby exposing hidden vinculin binding sites. When vinculin is recruited to those sites, it reinforces the link between the cytoplasmic tails of the integrins and F-actin, thereby stabilizing the adhesions. Although the relevance of this model to the behavior of cells on soft and stiff matrices is still being debated, the talin\u2013vinculin module is clearly important for adhesion regulation and mechanosensing of the ECM. Importantly, our results show that although vinculin has an ABD, its ability to bind to \u03b1-catenin is equally vital for proper interaction with F-actin, and consequently for proper force transmission and adhesion maturation.\u03b1-Catenin regulates rigidity-dependent cell growth following EMTThe results presented until now raised the question of whether the role played by \u03b1-catenin in regulation of integrin adhesions could be affected by the presence of cadherin-based cell\u2013cell adhesions in the cells. To address this, we studied MEFs that were in contact with one another (mesenchymal cell\u2013cell) as well as with the matrix. We observed the presence of \u03b1-catenin, \u03b2-catenin, and N-cadherin in the mesenchymal cell\u2013cell contacts and found that \u03b2-catenin (but not N-cadherin) was also present at the lamellipodia along with \u03b1-catenin (Fig. S5 A). Still, in such cells, mature vinculin-containing FAs formed in lamellipodial regions containing \u03b1-catenin (Fig. S5 A), suggesting that \u03b1-catenin can affect both cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix adhesion regulatory processes within the same cell. The extent of this effect might depend on the cell type. For instance, in epithelial layers, where cells are linked through AJs, recruitment of \u03b1-catenin to integrin adhesions might be prevented, thereby inhibiting the formation of mature FAs. In support of this, we found a gradual increase in the cell edge localization of \u03b1-catenin when we used TGF\u03b2 to induce the EMT of the epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line (Fig. 5 A).\u03b1-Catenin plays a role in TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. (A) Top: \u03b1-Catenin and \u03b2-catenin localize at the cell edge, but \u03b2-catenin is missing from the edge upon \u03b1-catenin KD.

(G) MTT measurement of WT MEFs, \u03b1-catenin KD MEFs, and \u03b1-catenin KD MEFs expressing WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin or GFP-\u03b1-catenin L344P, plated for 24 h on 0.2-kPa FN-coated matrices. In the Annexin/PI graphs, positive and negative controls, the cells were heated at 65\u00b0C for 15 min for the former and left untreated for the latter and plated on FN-coated plastic Ibidi wells. For the MTT assay, the positive growth control refers to WT and \u03b1-catenin KD MEF cells plated on a FN-coated 96-well plate (plastic). Statistical analysis of the \u03b1-catenin cell-edge localization (A) was tested by nested ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test, and percentage of apoptotic cells and MTT assay (D\u2013G) were tested by ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ****, P < 0.0001).To further address this, we set out to test whether \u03b1-catenin was involved in the induction of EMT, particularly in the context of matrix rigidity, which was shown to be a positive regulator of the process. To that end, we used WT MDCK cells as well as an MDCK variant in which \u03b1-catenin expression was stably knocked down (; Fig. S5 B). First, to test the effect of \u03b1-catenin KD, we grew the cells for 48 h on FN-coated glass coverslips and quantified the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). WT MDCKs displayed a strong epithelial phenotype with tight E-cadherin connections between the cells and very low vimentin levels (Fig. S5 C). \u03b1-Catenin KD MDCK cells were less tightly packed compared with the WT cells and displayed E-cadherin adhesions, accompanied with a slight increase in vimentin and \u03b1-SMA intensity (Fig. S5, C and D). These results indicated that the loss of \u03b1-catenin was not sufficient for the cells to undergo complete EMT (which was observed only upon treatment with TGF\u03b2; Fig. S5 D). We next tested if the absence of \u03b1-catenin could affect EMT occurrence as a function of matrix rigidity. To that end, we plated both cell lines on soft (0.2 kPa) and stiff (25 kPa) FN-coated substrates for 3 h, before adding TGF\u03b2 to the plates. After a 72-h incubation, WT cells on the soft matrix remained epithelial (Fig. S5 E), whereas on the stiff matrix, the cells formed colonies that were less tightly packed, with cells that were detached from the colonies at the periphery (Fig. S5 E, yellow arrows), indicative of partial EMT. Interestingly, on soft matrices the KD cells also displayed a partial EMT phenotype, while on stiff matrices they underwent complete EMT, as evident by the complete loss of cell\u2013cell contacts and spindle-like morphologies characteristic of mesenchymal cells (Fig. S5 E). Thus, although the baseline phenotypes of WT and \u03b1-catenin KD MDCK cells on soft matrices differed in the presence of TGF\u03b2 (fully epithelial and partial EMT, respectively), stiff matrices shifted both cell types toward the mesenchymal state (partial EMT and complete EMT, respectively). Still, the transition to partial EMT on soft surfaces was enabled only when \u03b1-catenin was absent from the cells (Fig. S5 E), suggesting an important role for \u03b1-catenin in sensing soft matrices.To test the role of \u03b1-catenin in mechanosensing also at the mesenchymal state, we focused on the induction of apoptosis in response to soft matrices, which normally occurs when cells fail to properly attach and spread. To that end, we induced EMT of WT and \u03b1-catenin KD MDCK cells in plastic dishes and then transferred them onto soft (0.2-kPa) FN-coated substrates (Fig. 5 B). Remarkably, Annexin V and PI staining showed that only \u223c20% of \u03b1-catenin KD MDCK cells activated apoptosis 6 h after plating, compared with \u223c95% of WT MDCK cells (Fig. 5, C and D). We observed similar results with normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, another epithelial cell line, after knocking down the expression of \u03b1-catenin (Fig. 5, C and E; and Fig. S5 B). Furthermore, \u03b1-catenin KD and the L344P mutation in the MEFs both led to apoptosis inhibition on 0.2-kPa FN-coated surfaces, compared with WT controls (Fig. 5, C and F). Importantly, using the MTT assay we verified that while WT MEFs and MEFs expressing WT GFP-\u03b1-catenin failed to proliferate\u00a0on the 0.2-kPa surfaces, \u03b1-catenin KD and L344P mutant cells were able to proliferate on such matrices (Figs. 5 G and S5 F).Notably, the observed avoidance of apoptosis and ability to grow on soft matrices by \u03b1-catenin KD and L344P mutant cells was accompanied by enhanced cell spreading (Figs. 5 C and S5 F), which was in contrast to the behavior of the same cells on stiff surfaces (Fig. 4, B and D). We propose that this discrepancy could be explained by the low rate of nascent adhesion turnover on soft matrices compared with stiff ones. On stiff matrices, the impaired connection between integrins and F-actin in absence of \u03b1-catenin or the presence of the L344P mutant leads to slower force loading, which prevents the mechanosensitive adhesion proteins (e.g., talin) from experiencing high enough forces, thus precluding rapid adhesion reinforcement through recruitment of additional proteins (vinculin) into the adhesions. Hence, the adhesions disassemble before recruitment occurs, and on average the cells are left with small, immature adhesions, and they spread poorly. In contrast, the slow disassembly rate of nascent adhesions on soft surfaces provides sufficient time for the adhesions to grow without disassembling despite the slow force loading in \u03b1-catenin KD or L344P mutant cells. Therefore, we propose that adhesion growth does not depend solely on the contractile activity that is transmitted through the adhesions to the ECM per se, but rather depends on the balance between cellular force loading and the external rigidity. This can affect downstream cellular decisions, whereby large adhesions support cell survival and proliferation, as in the case of WT cells on stiff matrices or \u03b1-catenin KD/L344P-expressing cells on soft matrices (Fig. 5 G; see also). Notably, this might be important also for understanding the involvement of \u03b1-catenin in cancer, which is classically associated with its role in the maintenance of AJs and/or its involvement in cytoplasmic sequestration of pro-proliferative transcriptional regulators. Our findings add an additional layer to this picture, as they indicate that \u03b1-catenin regulates integrin adhesions and mechanosensing, which are directly linked to anchorage independence, a hallmark of cancer cells.Materials and methodsCell culture, reagents, and transfectionsWT MEFs (referred to in other publications as RPTP\u03b1+/+ cells) were isolated from embryonic day 13 (E13)\u2013E15 WT embryos and underwent spontaneous immortalization. NIH3T3 (#CRL-1658; ATCC), WT MDCK (#CCL-34; ATCC), and MDCK \u03b1-catenin KD (generated from the WT MDCK by shRNA) were received from MBI Singapore cell collection. Vinculin\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were obtained from Benny Geiger\u2019s lab (Weizmann Institute of Science), originally generated from vinculin\u2212/\u2212 mice provided by E.D.

The L344P, L344A, and V796A mutations were inserted into the GFP-\u03b1-catenin plasmid using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs).Lentiviral KD of \u03b1-catenin was performed using the SHCLNG-NM_009818 MISSION shRNA plasmid (Merck) targeting the sequence 5\u2032-CCG\u200bGGC\u200bCAG\u200bGAG\u200bTTT\u200bACA\u200bCAG\u200bAGA\u200bACT\u200bCGA\u200bGTT\u200bCTC\u200bTGT\u200bGTA\u200bAAC\u200bTCC\u200bTGG\u200bCTT\u200bTTT\u200bG-3\u2032; control cells were generated using the SHC202\u2014MISSION TRC2 pLKO.5-puro Non-Mammalian shRNA Control Plasmid (Merck). After infection, cells were grown in 1 and 4 \u03bcg/ml puromycin for MDCK and MEF, and KD was tested using Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence measurements.Pillars, soft gel fabrication, and cell spreadingMolds for pillar fabrication were generated by high-resolution photolithography, using a 5\u00d7 reduction autostepper (GCA Autostep 200 DSW i-line, Integrated Solutions) to pattern the photoresist. A C4F8/SF4-based deep reactive ion etch was performed on the wafers to etch holes to the desired depth. After stripping the photoresist, the silicon masters were cleaned and then silanized with (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane (#T2492; United Chemical Technologies) overnight under vacuum. Pillars were fabricated by pouring polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sylgard 184, Dow Corning; mixing ratio 10:1) into the molds. The molds were then placed, face down, onto glass-bottom 35-mm dishes (#0 coverslip; Cellvis) which were incubated at 65\u00b0C for 12 h to cure the PDMS. The molds were immersed in ethanol to prevent pillar collapse and pried off the dish. The ethanol was replaced with PBS by serial dilutions. Human plasma full-length FN (#FC010-10MG; Merck) was added to the dish at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5g/\u03bcl for 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C. Next, residual FN was washed away by replacing the solution with HBSS (#03-025-1B; Biological Industries) supplemented with 20 mM Hepes (#02-018-1A; Biological Industries), pH 7.2, or PBS.All pillars had a diameter of 2 \u00b5m and a height of 13.2 \u00b5m. These pillars were used to measure the long-term time-dependent forces that are generated after initial formation and reinforcement of the adhesions. The center-to-center spacing between pillars was 4 \u03bcm. Pillar bending stiffness, kECM, was calculated by Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam theory:where D and L are the diameter and length of the pillar, respectively, and E is the Young\u2019s modulus of the material (2 MPa for the PDMS used here). The 0.2- and 25-kPa substrates were fabricated by using Sylgard 52-276 at ratios of 2:1 and 1:2.7, respectively, according to the measurements performed previously.Pillar displacement measurements1 d before the pillar experiments, cells were sparsely plated to minimize cell\u2013cell interactions before replating. The next day, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged with growth medium, resuspended, and preincubated in HBSS/Hepes at 37\u00b0C for 30 min before the experiment. Cells were then spread on the FN-coated pillars. In all cases, we made sure that the cells were isolated when plated on the substrates.Time-lapse imaging of cells spreading on the pillars was performed using an inverted microscope (Leica DMIRE2) at 37\u00b0C using a 63\u00d7 1.4-NA oil-immersion objective. Bright-field images were recorded every 10 s with a Retiga EXi Fast 1394 charge-coupled device camera (QImaging). The microscope and camera were controlled by Micromanager software. For each cell, a video of 1\u20133 h was recorded. To minimize photo damage to the cells, a 600-nm longpass filter was inserted into the illumination path.Tracking of pillar movements over time was performed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) using the Nanotracking plugin, as described previously. In short, the cross-correlation between the pillar image in every frame of the video and an image of the same pillar from the first frame of the video was calculated, and the relative x and y position of the pillar in every frame of the video was obtained. To consider only movements of pillars from their zero position, we analyzed only pillars that at the start of the video were not in contact with the cell and that were reached by the cell edge during the video. Drift correction was performed using data from pillars far from any cell in each video. For each pillar, the displacement curve was generated by Matlab (vR2017a; MathWorks).Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitationFor immunoblots, ice-cold PBS was used to wash the cells. The cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Tris-HCl 10 mM, 1% SDS, 10 mg/ml deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors cocktail [Roche]). The total protein samples were separated using by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked using 5% milk and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C for mouse anti-\u03b1-catenin (1:1,000, sc-9988; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-GAPDH (1:10,000, #ab8245; Abcam) as a loading control. Next, the membranes were exposed to peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, #AB_2338504; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. The EZ-ECL Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (#1705061; Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to visualize and analyze the protein bands.For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were incubated with 3 \u03bcg of anti-vinculin (#700062; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 3 \u03bcg of anti-\u03b1-catenin (sc-9988; Santa Cruz) in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 1% NP-40) containing 0.2 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride [#101500; Calbiochem]) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then rotated with Pierce Protein G Magnetic Beads (#88848; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Protein complexes were washed three times in PBS and subsequently extracted with 1\u00d7 SDS loading buffer for 3 min at 95\u00b0C. SDS-PAGE, WB, and enhanced chemiluminescence analyses were performed as discussed above.Immunofluorescence microscopyFor immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were plated on FN-coated coverslips or Matrigel-coated Ibidi 8-well chamber slides and fixed with 4% PFA (#47608; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 (#T8787; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Blocking was performed using 3% BSA (#A4503; Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at RT. Immunolabeling was performed with primary antibodies against mouse anti-\u03b1-catenin (1:300, sc-9988; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-vinculin (1:500, #700062; Thermo Fisher Scientific), rat anti-E-cadherin (1:300, #U3254; Merck), rabbit anti-\u03b1-actinin (1:500, #ab108198; Abcam), rabbit anti-zyxin (1:100, received from Benny Geiger\u2019s lab, generated in-house), chicken anti-vimentin (1:500, #ab24525; Abcam), rabbit anti-N-cadherin (1:200, #ab18203; Abcam), rabbit anti-\u03b2-catenin (1:200, #C2206; Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit anti-\u03b1-SMA (1:200, #A2547; Cell Marque) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The cells were washed three times with PBS followed by the addition of goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 405\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #ab175661; Abcam), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #ab150061; Abcam), goat anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #A-11006; Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #ab150118; Abcam), goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 555\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #ab150170; Abcam), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #ab150067; Abcam), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, #ab150119; Abcam), phalloidin Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, #A12379; Thermo Fisher Scientific), phalloidin Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500, #A34055; Thermo Fisher Scientific), phalloidin Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500, #A22287; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and phalloidin-iFluor 594 Reagent (1:1,000, #ab176757; Abcam) for 1 h at RT in the dark. After washing the secondary antibodies three times with PBS, ProLong Gold Antifade reagent was added to mount the coverslips. Images were then taken at RT with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope using a 20\u00d7 0.9-NA air objective (Fig. 5 C) and 63\u00d7 1.4-NA oil objective controlled by Zen imaging software (Zeiss).Image analyses and quantificationsAnalyses of the cell area and number of mature and sliding adhesions were performed using a home-built Fiji macro (National Institutes of Health). The confocal images were subjected to an intensity threshold to select the cell area using the phalloidin channel, and the \u201canalyze particles\u201d tool was used to measure the area of the cell. To account for mature adhesions, a cell mask was generated that measured the cell area from a distance of 2 \u03bcm from the cell edge on all sides. The number of adhesions in the cell center was calculated using the \u201canalyze particle\u201d tool after thresholding the vinculin channel.EMT experimentsThe MDCK WT, MDCK \u03b1-catenin KD, NMuMG WT, and \u03b1-catenin KD were sparsely plated on FN-coated 0.2- and 25-kPa gels. 3 h after plating, EGF (50 ng/ml) or TGF\u03b2 (10 ng/ml) was added to the medium and left for 48\u201372 h before fixation and staining. In another set of experiments, the cells were made to undergo EMT on plastic and then plated on the FN-coated 0.2-kPa PDMS gels.Cell viability assaysThe cell viability of the MEFs was assessed using the MTT assay (#M5655; Merck). 1 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded on FN-coated plastic and 0.2-kPa gels in 96-well plates and incubated in DMEM. After 24 h, the MTT reagent was added to the cells at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. The DMEM was removed, and 10% SDS in 0.1 M HCl was added to dissolve the crystals. The amount of MTT formazan product was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader.Apoptosis assaysThe apoptosis assay was performed using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Staining/Detection Kit (#14085; Abcam). 1 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded on FN-coated plastic and 0.2 kPa gels on Ibidi 8-well chamber slides. For the positive and negative controls, the cells were heated at 65\u00b0C for 15 min (positive) and left untreated (negative) and plated on FN-coated plastic Ibidi wells. 6 h after plating, 10 \u03bcl of FITC-Annexin V and 10 \u03bcl of propidium iodide (PI) were added to the cells for 15 min and incubated in the dark. The staining of the apoptotic cells (Annexin V + PI positive) were assessed using Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope with a 20\u00d7 0.9-NA air objective.Single-cell motility assayThe cells were incubated with 400 nM of SiR-DNA (#SC007; Spirochrome) in full DMEM, overnight at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were then trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in colorless DMEM. 1 \u00d7 104 cells were plated in each well of a FN-coated glass-bottom 24-well plates (#P24-0-N; Cellvis) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were then imaged at 10\u00d7 magnification every 15 min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 using an ImageXpress micro system (Molecular Devices). Quantifications were performed using the Manual Tracking plugin in Fiji and the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool (Ibidi, downloaded from: https://ibidi.com/chemotaxis-analysis/171-chemotaxis-and-migration-tool.html).RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)RNA was extracted from cultured cells using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (12183018A; Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed with qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (95047-100; Quanta Biosciences). In qRT-PCR experiments, 10 ng cDNA was used, and PCR products were detected using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (4385614; Applied Biosystems). Expression results were normalized to Gapdh and to the indicated control groups (relative quantification = 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct; Ct, threshold count).

These cells were then plated on FN-coated coverslips held in a Chamlide CMS coverslip holder, and live-cell images were taken with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope using a 63\u00d7 1.4-NA objective at intervals of 20 s.Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated at least twice on separate days using duplicates and triplicates on each day. The statistical analysis was carried out with the help of GraphPad Prism (v9.0.0). All quantifications represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. Two-tailed unpaired t test with Welch\u2019s correction was used for group comparisons whereas multiple group comparisons were performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test, as indicated in the figure legends. Differences were considered to be statistically significant from a P value <0.05.Online supplemental materialFig. S1 shows that the dominant \u03b1-catenin isoform that is expressed in the MEFs is \u03b1E-catenin, and that \u03b1-catenin is recruited to the cell edge in the absence of vinculin or \u03b1-actinin. It also shows the enrichment of \u03b1-catenin in regions containing actin stress fibers. Fig. S2 shows the lack of colocalization of \u03b1-actinin and \u03b1-catenin. Fig. S3 shows the co-IP of \u03b1-catenin and vinculin, the ruffling of the cell edge in the absence of \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction, and the bundling of \u03b1-catenin in the center of vinculin\u2212/\u2212 MEFs. Fig. S4 shows that knocking down \u03b1-catenin in NIH3T3 cells results in formation of small adhesions and a decrease in cell spreading, and that the lack of \u03b1-catenin\u2013vinculin interaction prevents formation of mature zyxin-containing FAs on FN-coated coverslips or formation of sliding adhesions when MEFs are plated on Matrigel. It also shows confirmation of the expression of the \u03b1-catenin mutants on the background of \u03b1-catenin KD. Fig. S5 shows the presence of \u03b1-catenin along with \u03b2-catenin at the cell edge, and that FAs form in lamellipodial regions containing \u03b1-catenin in cells that also contain cell\u2013cell junctions. It also shows the effects of \u03b1-catenin KD on the EMT state of MDCK cells and the difference in spreading on soft gels in the presence of WT \u03b1-catenin and \u03b1-catenin-L344P.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "A combination of light microscopic, histochemical, immunohistochemical and transmission electron microscopic techniques were used to study the distribution and ultrastructural characterization of the stroma of Scirrhous 'infiltrating' carcinoma of the human breast. Both the light and electron microscopic techniques emphasized the presence of regional variations in the distribution of fibrous tissue in this type of tumour. Whilst fibronectin and collagen type III appeared relatively rich in both periductal and diffused regions, there was a clear contrast in the distribution of collagen type I and elastic tissue between the two regions. Collagen type I was more numerous in the diffused regions whereas elastic tissue was more produced in the periductal regions. The present study confirmed the views that Scirrhous carcinoma cells secrete inappropriately the majority of collagen, elastic and possibly other fibrillar elements of the connective tissue stroma.

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

        "content": "The expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is generally associated with a less invasive and aggressive phenotype in breast carcinoma. In an attempt to understand the role of ERalpha in regulating breast cancer cells invasiveness, we have demonstrated that cell adhesion on fibronectin (Fn) and type IV Collagen (Col) induces ERalpha-mediated transcription and reduces cell migration in MCF-7 and in MDA-MB-231 cell lines expressing ERalpha. Analysis of deleted mutants of ERalpha indicates that the transcriptional activation function (AF)-1 is required for ERalpha-mediated transcription as well as for the inhibition of cell migration induced by cell adhesion on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In addition, the nuclear localization signal region and some serine residues in the AF-1 of the ERalpha are both required for the regulation of cell invasiveness as we have observed in HeLa cells. It is worth noting that c-Src activation is coincident with adhesion of cells to ECM proteins and that the inhibition of c-Src activity by PP2 or the expression of a dominant-negative c-Src abolishes ERalpha-mediated transcription and partially reverts the inhibition of cell invasiveness in ERalpha-positive cancer cells. These findings address the integrated role of ECM proteins and ERalpha in influencing breast cancer cell motility through a mechanism that involves c-Src and seems not to be related to a specific cell type.",

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view.

        "title": "MT1-MMP correlates with MMP-2 activation potential seen after epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast carcinoma cells.",
        "content": "We have previously reported that human breast carcinoma (HBC) cell lines expressing the mesenchymal intermediate filament protein vimentin (VIM+) are highly invasive in vitro, and highly metastatic in nude mice when compared to their VIM- counterparts. Since only VIM+ cell lines can be induced to activate matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) upon stimulation with Concanavalin A (Con A), we have examined here membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), a cell surface activator of MMP-2. Northern analysis reveals baseline expression of MT1-MMP in five of the six VIM+ cell lines studied (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, BT-549, Hs578T, MCF-7(ADR)), each of which showed variable activation of exogenous MMP-2 after treatment with Con A. In contrast, the four VIM-, poorly invasive HBC cell lines studied (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB 468, ZR-75-1) lacked baseline MT1-MMP mRNA expression, and showed no induction of either MT1-MMP expression or MMP-2-activation with Con A. Such differential MT1-MMP expression was confirmed in vivo using in situ hybridization analysis of nude mouse tumor xenografts of representative cell lines. Western analysis of the MDA-MB-231 cells revealed baseline membrane expression of a 60 kDa species, which was strongly induced by Con A treatment along with a weaker band co-migrating with that from MT1-MMP-transfected COS-1 cells (63 kDa), presumably representing latent MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP immunofluorescence strongly decorated Con A-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells in a manner consistent with membranous staining, but did not decorate the unstimulated MDA-MB-231 cells or MCF-7 cells under either condition. Collectively, the results suggest the constitutive production of active MT1-MMP which is unavailable for either MMP-2 activation or immuno-decoration until Con A treatment. Since VIM expression arises by virtue of the so-called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in invasive embryonic epithelia, we propose that this represents a major metastasis mechanism in breast carcinomas. MT1-MMP on the surface of such 'fibroblastoid' carcinoma cells may mediate a paracrine loop for the utilization of stromally produced MMP-2, and contribute to the poorer survival associated with VIM+ breast carcinomas.",

        "full_text": "Synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 film on Ni3Fe alloy foam as an excellent electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction\u2020Directly synthesizing bicomponent electrocatalysts in the nanostructured form from bulk alloy foam has many potential advantages: robust stability, synergistic effects and fast electron transfer. Here, Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 film with micrometer thickness on bulk substrate was synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermally assisted sulfurization of Ni3Fe alloy foam for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic media. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of the bicomponent, reduced interfacial resistance between electrocatalyst and metal substrate, and more exposed catalytic sites on the microstructured film, the as-prepared electrocatalyst (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe) behaves as a highly efficient and robust oxygen evolution electrode with felicitous current density in alkaline electrolytes (1 M KOH). It requires an overpotential of only 264 mV to drive 100 mA cm\u22122 with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 20 h in 1 M KOH. In the near future, this kind of synthesis strategy can be easily extended to investigate many electrocatalysts derived from 3D alloyed foam with various ratios of the different components, opening new avenue for understanding the relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance.Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe composite materials show excellent OER electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solutions.IntroductionThe energy crisis and environmental issues are critical challenges, due to limitations of fossil fuels and population growth. In order to deal with these problems, research on new energy sources is necessary. New energy sources such as solar and wind energies are highly promising alternatives, but their use is limited by their intermittencies and geographically uneven distributions. Thus, suitable energy storage strategies are needed. Electrochemical water-splitting is one of the principle methods to garner hydrogen fuel as a clean and abundant energy resource with its high energy storage density as well as zero carbon emission. Currently, the real voltage for water splitting is much higher than the theoretical value (1.23 V) because of the intrinsic activation barrier of the catalytic centres, interfacial resistance and other voltage losses in the electric circuit. The full water splitting involves two half-reactions, whose overpotentials are further complicated by the high intrinsic activation barriers inherent to the two half reactions involved in water splitting, i.e., the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the overall rate is heavily dependent on the OER catalyst, due to the sluggish kinetics and complex reaction pathway of the OER. Up to now, noble metal oxides (RuO2 and IrO2) are considered as benchmarked catalysts, but their high cost and scarcity severely impede their wide applications.Recently, much effort has focused on inexpensive and earth-abundant elements-based materials as viable alternatives for OER, such as transition-metal sulfides, selenides, oxides, nitrides and (oxy)-hydroxides. It has been demonstrated that transitional-metal chalcogenides exhibit enhanced conductivity and the electroactive performance can be further ameliorated by doping other elements, deriving hydro(oxide) nanoshell and forming nanostructures. Doping single phase with other elements can induce the electron transfer between each element, leading to the further modulation of the adsorption of hydrogen(oxygen) molecules on the active sites and of the kinetic energy barrier of hydrogen(oxygen) evolution pathway. Previously, Xu et al. synthesizes Fe-doped Ni3S2 from NiFe foil, which requires overpotential of 282 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. The second approach for enhancing the performance of single active site can be realized by constructing new interfaces with two components, which have been demonstrated by several studies. The second component can adjust the electron density around the active sites in the first layer via the new formed interface. In some cases, the new interface allows the two components to act synergistically: one component allows H2O(OH\u2212) adsorption and the other component facilitates the O2(H2) release. It has reported in several cases that some chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts intend to transform into metal (hydro)oxides, which is verified to be active catalytic centre on the surface. Controlled formation of electroactive nanoshell on the surface has the unique advantage, retaining the electroactive performance and the excellent bulk conductivity simultaneously. For majorities of the chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts developed recently, designing materials in nanostructured form further enhances the overall performance by exposing more active sites in the solid\u2013electrolyte interface.Direct sulfurization of 3D metal foam has been proved to be an effective method to synthesize the catalysts which is seamlessly integrated with bulk conductive materials. Notably, X. Zou et al. have demonstrated that, using NF as support, Ni3S2 can be formed via one-step hydrothermal sulfides method, the exposed (210) facet leading to an excellent catalytic activity of Ni3S2 film. Using NF as support, Sun's group has synthesized Fe-doped Ni3S2 particle, benefited from the doping effects, the as-prepared material shown excellent performance and stability. However less reports have presented one-step chemically derivation of 3D alloy foam. After chemically derivation of alloy foam, it is highly possible to form new interface between two components. Furthermore, the excellent conductivity is still retained because of the integration with bulk alloy form. Most importantly, adjusting the ratio between each element in the alloy foam has the potential to form totally different scenario. Previous works normally synthesize two chalcogenide-based components with newly formed interface by electrodepositing single component precursor or by hydrothermally preparing single component precursor. The single component precursor contains at least two metal elements in the ion form. Liu et al. successfully prepared NiFeS electrocatalyst with further sulfurization process of NiFe hydroxides precursor, which showed superior OER performance.Herein, we report, for the first time, the synthesis of stable and high-performance Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 hybrid materials supported on alloy foam (Ni3Fe), dubbed Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe. One step hydrothermal method was used to prepare the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 composite, which is easy and efficient for upscale production without adding external metal ions. Nickel-iron foam was selected as a scaffold to form 3D conductive networks and promote electronic conductivity, exposing a large surface area of active sites. In addition, the synergistic interaction between Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2 can improve overall properties of the material. Therefore, in the alkaline media, the prepared Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe electrode showed superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER, which showed a small onset potential of only 1.38 V (RHE) and a low overpotential of only 166 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. Additionally, Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe also showed a small Tafel slope of 63.31 mV dec\u22121 and excellent stability.Experimental detailsMaterialsHydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium hydroxide (KOH), thiourea, acetone and ethanol were acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. RuO2 and Nafion (5 wt%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ni3Fe alloy foam, Ni foam and Fe foam were received from Kun Shan Kunag Xun Electronics Co., Ltd., China. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The water used throughout all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.Synthesis of Ni3S2\u2016NF, FeS2\u2016Fe and Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3FeFirstly, Ni3Fe alloy foam (1.4 \u00d7 3.3 cm2) was washed with acetone by sonication for 10 minutes, then the Ni3Fe alloy foam was treated with 3 M HCl by sonication for 10 minutes, finally, the Ni3Fe alloy foam was washed with water three times to get clean Ni3Fe samples. To synthesize Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe electrode, 0.8 g of thiourea was dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring for 15 minutes. Then the freshly prepared thiourea solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) containing a piece of pretreated Ni3Fe alloy foam into the solution. The autoclave was sealed and then heated at 180 \u00b0C for 16 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature naturally, the obtained Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe was washed with de-ionized water several times and then dried in vacuum. For comparison, Ni3S2\u2016Ni and FeS2\u2016Fe electrodes were also fabricated using the same procedure except that Ni foam or Fe foam was used as current collector and metal source.Materials characterizationThe crystal structure of the as-prepared Ni3Fe, and Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe samples have been measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE, Cu KR). The morphology and phase information of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SU8010). XPS was performed on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer using an Al K\u03b1 photon-source.Electrochemical characterizationAll of the electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. The as-prepared Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe were used directly as the working electrode without further treatments. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed at the potential ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 V (vs. SCE) at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) determination was conducted in the frequency range from 1.0 \u00d7 105 Hz to 1.0 Hz. The geometric surface area of the electrode is 0.2 cm2. All the measured current densities were obtained by dividing the current with the geometric surface area. The electrochemical characterizations were carried in a standard three-electrode system by using a graphite bulk counter electrode and a Hg/Hg2Cl2 (sat. KCl) reference electrode. The potentials reported here were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): E(RHE) = E(Hg/Hg2Cl2) + 0.0591 \u00d7 pH + 0.2415 \u2212 0.000761(T \u2212 298.15).Results and discussionsMorphology and composition characterizationAs shown in Scheme 1, one-step synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 on Ni3Fe foam without addition of extra metal ions is quite straightforward. After hydrothermal sulfurization of alloy foam, mountainous terrain (Fig. 1) on macroporous foam is formed, which is totally different from the bare smooth surface of Ni3Fe foam (Fig. S1\u2020). The sample fragment scraped down from the alloy foam shows that the composite has clear edges in the low-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3b). In combination with the XRD pattern in Fig. 2, it can reason that the mountainous terrain is mainly composed of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2. More detailed information can be gleaned from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2). As for XRD pattern measured from Ni3Fe foam, the peaks at 44.2\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0, 75.8\u00b0 are corresponding to (111), (200), (220) planes of Ni3Fe (JCPDS 88-1715). After sulfurization of alloy foam, many new peaks have appeared. The peaks at 21.8\u00b0, 31.2\u00b0, 37.8\u00b0, 44.4\u00b0, 49.8\u00b0 can be ascribed to (100), (110), (111), (200), (210) planes of Ni3S2 (JCPDS 73-0698) and the peaks at 15.3\u00b0, 29.5\u00b0, 30.8\u00b0, 47.0\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0 correspond well with (111), (311), (222), (511), (440) planes of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 (JCPDS 73-0515). Therefore, it is confirmed that the formed product has two components (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2). No other impurities in the samples were revealed in XRD measurements.Schematic illustration of preparation of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 composite on Ni3Fe foam.(a\u2013c) SEM images of the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe mountainous terrain on Ni3Fe alloy foam.

A scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was utilized for measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a and d, lattice fringes with interplanar distance of 0.3 nm were clearly revealed in the high-resolution image, which corresponds to the (311) plane of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8, the distance of 0.234 nm can be ascribed to the (1\u221211) plane of the Ni3S2 phase, respectively. It indicates that the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 phase was synthesized successfully in accordance with the XRD. Elemental mapping images in Fig. 3c, e and f and EDS pattern (Fig. S4\u2020) illustrate the presence of Ni, Fe and S, further proofing the existence of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2.(a and d) High resolution TEM image of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe.

(c, e and f) Elements mapping (Ni, Fe, S) in Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe, respectively.Surface chemistryX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is an effective approach to analyse the surface element valence and chemical bonding environments in the composite. A survey of XPS spectrum confirms the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe sample contains Fe, Ni, and S atoms. The Ni 2p XPS peaks located at 855.62 eV and 873.47 eV can be assigned to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies, respectively (Fig. 4a). These values are consistent with those for Ni2+ in Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2. The peaks corresponding to the binding energy of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 at 724.04 and 711.24 eV demonstrate the trivalent state of Fe in the composite (Fig. 4b). The peaks of S 2p at 162.39 and 163.56 eV were attributed to negative bivalent S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4c), indicating the bivalent state of S, The peak at 168.25 eV is well matched to the highly oxidized state S4+ at the edge of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2. The above results confidently confirm the successful synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2.XPS spectra for (a) Ni 2p. (b) Fe 2p. (c) S 2p of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe.Electrocatalytic activityFor each sample measured in three-electrode system, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) were measured to assess the electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH solution (Fig. 5a). For comparison, several control samples such as bare Ni3Fe foam, Ni3S2\u2016Ni, FeS2\u2016Fe and RuO2 (loading amount: 6 mg cm\u22122) were tested. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves for OER of the tested samples at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Remarkably, the samples (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe) prepared at 180 \u00b0C show the best performance (Fig. S2\u2020) and the bare Ni3Fe foam only manifests negligible activity at overpotential of 300 mV. Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe possesses the ability to deliver current density of 10 and 100 mA cm\u22122 at overpotential of 166 and 264 mV, respectively, outperforming the above-mentioned control samples. FeS2\u2016Fe, Ni3S2\u2016Ni and RuO2 require overpotential of 330, 350 and 360 mV to achieved current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 5e). These results confirm that the electrocatalyst prepared in this study has enhanced activity after sulfurization and is even superior to some noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. It is proposed that direct seamless integration of electrocatalyst with conductive Ni3Fe alloy substrate plays an important role for the improved performance of OER. The simultaneous presence of Fe and Ni allows the opportunity to synthesize bicomponent electrocatalyst with potential synergistic effect. After OER tests, the Ni in Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe was oxidized to metal oxides by electro-chemical oxidation in alkaline solution, the valence of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 also shifted to higher state 856.79 and 874.53 eV and two satellite peaks at 862.65 and 880.66 eV, the energy separation between Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 is \u224817.7 eV, which indicated the existence of NiO phase by XPS spectra (Fig. S6a\u2020). Furthermore, the valence of Fe also shifted to higher state 712.40 eV and 725.30 eV with new satellites 718.31 eV and 731.49 eV related with Fe2O3 phase (Fig. S6b\u2020). Deconvolution of oxygen peak revealed one new peak as compared to OER test, indicating formation of oxygen\u2013metal bond (Fig. S7\u2020). From these analyses, it can reason that new metal-hydro(oxide) phase was produced after OER test. Furthermore, the new peak at 167.80 eV in XPS of S 2p verified the oxidation of sulfur to SO42\u2212 (Fig. S6c\u2020). A slight degradation of catalytic performance after 1000 cycles of CV test can be ascribed to the oxidation of catalytic surface (Fig. 5d).(a) CV polarization curves for OER. (b) Tafel plots with the corresponding Tafel slopes for the OER process. (c) Chronoamperometric durability test at a constant overpotential of 215 mV. (d) The CV curves before and after the durability test. (e) Overpotentials at current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. (f) Quantitative O2 measurement via water displacement.Tafel slope as a quality descriptor derived from the CV curves is used to investigate the OER catalytic kinetic performance of the samples. As shown in (Fig. 5b), the electrocatalyst (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe) shows fastest kinetics at the onset potential, demonstrated by the Tafel slope (63.31 mV dec\u22121). The Tafel slope value of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe is smaller than those of FeS2\u2016Fe (89.13 mV dec\u22121), Ni3S2\u2016Ni (65.17 mV dec\u22121), RuO2 (74.21 mV dec\u22121) and Ni3Fe alloy (64.46 mV dec\u22121). The long-term durability (Fig. 5c, d and S3\u2020) of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe for OER was assessed by applying constant overpotential of 215 mV for 20 h. After 20 h of constant overpotential test, the current density of 15 mA cm\u22122 does not change significantly, the CV curves after 1000 CV cycles has only slight shifted as compared to that before cyclic scanning, manifesting its outstanding stability for OER. The XRD characterization after stability test shows the same pattern as that before electrochemical measurements (Fig. S5\u2020). The same mountainous terrain was retained with appearance of much rougher surface possibly because of surface oxidation. XPS also reconfirmed the same trend of surface oxidation. Nevertheless, the recorded CV curve after 3000 cycles of CV almost overlapped with that after 1000 cycles. Undoubtedly, this catalyst can stabilize after formation of metal-hydro(oxide) shell without further degradation. The existence of XPS peaks of sulfur after OER stability test is an excellent evidence for retainment of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2.The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of electroactive materials can be obtained by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), given the fact that Cdl is proportional to the ECSA. The Cdl was obtained through cyclic voltammetric scans at different rates (20 to 140 mV s\u22121) and in the non-faradaic potential range. Cdl increases from 2.19 mF dec\u22121 for Ni3Fe alloy foam to 7.74 mF dec\u22121 for Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe, indicating that Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2 improved the electrochemical active surface area, thus contributing to the improved electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 6a\u2013c). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further used to investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the catalyst\u2013electrolyte interface during the OER.(a and b) CV curves of the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe and Ni3Fe electrodes measured in 1.0 M KOH in the non-faradaic region with different scan rates from 20 to 140 mV s\u22121. (c) Current density differences (\u0394J/2) plotted against scan rates of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe and Ni3Fe. (d) Nyquist plots of different catalysts in 1.0 M KOH.Apparently, it is shown in Fig. 6d that the values of resistance charge transfer (Rct) for the five samples are arranged in the order of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe < RuO2 < FeS2\u2016Fe < Ni3S2\u2016Ni < Ni3Fe, the smaller Rct value reveals faster charge transport of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe during the OER catalytic process, which is beneficial to the generation of O2. Although the Cdl is a relatively small value, the fast electron transfer and high turnover frequency of single active site definitely offset this disadvantage. Moreover, the final activity of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe is pretty competitive among recently reported electrocatalysts (Table S1\u2020).ConclusionsIn summary, we have demonstrated a simple and one-step hydrothermal approach for synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 on Ni3Fe alloy foams. Direct growth of electrocatalyst with mountainous terrain on bulk foam endows this system with felicitous stability in strongly alkaline electrolytes, evidenced by SEM, XRD and XPS characterization after stability tests. The lowest electron transfer resistance shown by EIS further enhances the performance of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2. Formation of thin metal metal-hydro (oxide) shell around the electrocatalyst and conductive core (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2) inside may work together to boost the overall activity. With these excellent figures of merit, it requires an overpotential of only 264 mV to drive 100 mA cm\u22122 with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 20 h in 1 M KOH. Further study entails understanding the working mechanism of this system in combination with more characterization methods and theoretical calculation. It is believed that the design strategy developed in this work may provide a new perspective for designing other advanced composite materials catalysts for electrocatalysis application.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts to declare.Supplementary MaterialReferences"

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs.

The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "Unlike heterogeneous tumor cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are genetically more stable which serve as a reliable target for tumor immunotherapy. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) which is restrictively expressed in tumor cells and CAF in vivo and plays a prominent role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis can function as a tumor rejection antigen. In the current study, we have constructed artificial FAP(+) stromal cells which mimicked the FAP(+) CAF in vivo. We immunized a breast cancer mouse model with FAP(+) stromal cells to perform immunotherapy against FAP(+) cells in the tumor microenvironment. By forced expression of FAP, we have obtained FAP(+) stromal cells whose phenotype was CD11b(+)/CD34(+)/Sca-1(+)/FSP-1(+)/MHC class I(+). Interestingly, proliferation capacity of the fibroblasts was significantly enhanced by FAP. In the breast cancer-bearing mouse model, vaccination with FAP(+) stromal cells has significantly inhibited the growth of allograft tumor and reduced lung metastasis indeed. Depletion of T cell assays has suggested that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in the tumor cytotoxic immune response. Furthermore, tumor tissue from FAP-immunized mice revealed that targeting FAP(+) CAF has induced apoptosis and decreased collagen type I and CD31 expression in the tumor microenvironment. These results implicated that immunization with FAP(+) stromal cells led to the disruption of the tumor microenvironment. Our study may provide a novel strategy for immunotherapy of a broad range of cancer. ",

Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T\u00a0cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation.

        "content": "The rejection of interferon alpha 1 gene-transfected mammary adenocarcinoma cells (TSA-IFN alpha) injected into syngeneic BALB/c mice was accompanied by an unusual stromal reaction and marked CD8-positive T-lymphocyte involvement. To investigate the biological background of this reaction, the possibility was evaluated that an interaction between TSA-IFN alpha and stromal cells might remodel the extracellular matrix (EM). When fibroblasts were co-cultured with TSA-IFN alpha or treated with exogenous IFN alpha, there was no change in their replication rate or collagen synthesis. By contrast, their fibronectin (FN) production and release were increased, resulting in enhanced fibroblast chemotaxis. These findings were mirrored by increased FN staining in the peritumoural and tumoural areas in vivo. IFN alpha thus determines increased FN production and hence massive local recruitment and activation of fibroblasts, with a modification of the EM. The several activities of IFN alpha should thus be considered prior to its employment in clinical trials.",

        "full_text": "Fabrication of thermo-sensitive lignocellulose hydrogels with switchable hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity through an SIPN strategyHerein, thermo-sensitive lignocellulose hydrogels with varying lignin contents were fabricated with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) by a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (SIPN) strategy using a LiCl/DMSO solvent system. Soda lignin mixed with the lignocellulose/LiCl/DMSO solution was also used to prepare the composite hydrogels, and the influence of the existential state of lignin on the hydrogel properties was analyzed objectively. The SIPN hydrogels exhibited more favorable mechanical properties due to the physical entanglement of poly-NIPAAm and lignocellulose. The presence of externally added lignin in the composite hydrogels is beneficial for mechanical improvement. Both the mechanical properties and the morphologies of the SIPN hydrogels can be tuned by varying the existential state and content of lignin. Furthermore, the prepared SIPN hydrogels showed rapid conversion from being hydrophilic at 20 \u00b0C to being hydrophobic at 45 \u00b0C. All SIPN hydrogels exhibited obvious oil absorbency in an oil/water mixture at 45 \u00b0C. Moreover, the different lignin existential states in the hydrogels resulted in different lower critical solution temperatures (LCST). This study provides a feasible route to produce reinforced thermo-sensitive hydrogels and develops a method for tailoring the morphology and the absorption properties of hydrogels by controlling the existential state and content of lignin.This study provides a feasible route to produce reinforced thermo-sensitive hydrogels and tailor their morphologies and absorption properties by controlling the state and content of lignin.IntroductionHydrogels are cross-linked (physically or chemically) hydrophilic polymers composed of three-dimensional structures, and they can absorb large amounts of water and swell in water systems without dissolution. Recently, intelligent hydrogels, also known as stimuli-responsive hydrogels, have attracted significant attention due to their hydrophilicity, permeability, and response to environmental stimuli such as temperature, pH, light, ionic strength, magnetism, and electromagnetic radiation. Among these stimuli-responsive hydrogels, thermo-sensitive hydrogels are most widely used since temperature is an important environmental factor in different application systems. As a typical thermo-sensitive monomer, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) has been widely used to synthesize thermo-sensitive hydrogels. When exposed to different external temperatures, these smart hydrogels can achieve hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic phase transitions around lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) due to the presence of hydrophobic isopropyl groups and hydrophilic amino groups in the network. They have been widely applied in biotechnology areas and wastewater treatment including oil/water separation. However, the applications of these hydrogels are limited by the lack of biodegradability and biocompatibility. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate natural polymers into these hydrogels to improve the environmental friendliness of these hydrogel systems.As a representative of biomass, lignocellulose is an ideal candidate for the preparation of biocompatible materials due to its abundance and good renewability. Most researchers focus on the preparation and application of cellulose-based thermo-responsive hydrogels by choosing lignin-free cellulose materials as the feedstock for their mature technology. However, the achievement of cellulose from lignocellulose materials requires a series of harsh separation and purification processes, and the usage of bleaching chemicals would increase the cost and decrease the environmental compatibility of the biomass. Furthermore, lignin, the most abundant aromatic polymer in nature, cements the cellulose and hemicellulose together in lignocellulose, providing mechanical support and rigidity. In addition, the numerous functional groups of lignin, such as phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl, methoxyl and carbonyl groups, endow it with sufficient reactivity with various compounds. Different studies have shown that incorporation of lignin in PVA hydrogels, epoxy resins and polyurethane products can effectively improve their mechanical properties and increase their renewable content. In addition, as a complex network of different phenylpropane units, lignin provides necessary hydrophobicity to plant cell walls. Polyester coatings and melamine sponges were functionalized with higher hydrophobic character by incorporating lignin into their systems. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that introducing lignin can benefit the production of thermo-sensitive hydrogels, and the different existential states of lignin may also endow smart hydrogels with different properties.Benefitting from the prior studies of the LiCl/DMSO solvent system in our group, ethylenediamine (EDA)-pretreated lignocellulose could be completely dissolved in LiCl/DMSO to afford a homogeneous solution under mild conditions (65 \u00b0C). Dissolution of lignocellulose in LiCl/DMSO requires pretreatment by either ball-milling or EDA complexation. Also, EDA-pretreatment can avoid mechanical degradation caused by ball-milling pretreatment. Furthermore, the subsequent dissolution after EDA-pretreatment does not require high temperatures; thus, structural modification of the lignin and cellulose degradation can also be avoided. The obtained lignocellulose solution can be used as the working medium for the fabrication of thermo-sensitive lignocellulose hydrogels.In this study, lignocellulose-based thermo-sensitive hydrogels with varying lignin contents were fabricated from wheat straw pulp-LiCl/DMSO solution via the SIPN strategy. Cellulose/lignin composite thermo-sensitive hydrogels were also prepared by the external addition of lignin. The chemical structures, morphologies, mechanical properties and absorption capacities were characterized, and the influences of the content and existential state of lignin on these properties were analyzed in detail. Both the mechanical properties and the morphologies of SIPN hydrogels can be tuned by varying the existential state and content of lignin. Moreover, the thermo-sensitive performance and oil absorbency were also studied.ExperimentalMaterialsOxygen-delignified wheat straw soda pulps with lignin contents of 4.27% (LC-1), 3.25% (LC-2) and 2.26% (LC-3) were provided by a local pulp and paper-making factory (Quanlin Paper, Shandong, China). The lignin contents were determined by the method of NREL/TP-510-42618. These pulps were pretreated with ethylenediamine (EDA) with a concentration of 1\u2009:\u200930 (solid\u2013liquid ratio, m/v), subjected to freeze-drying, and then maintained in SEBC bottles. Soda lignin was acid-precipitated and purified from the black liquor of wheat straw soda pulping. N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) was a product of Energy Chemical (Shanghai, China). N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAAm) was purchased from Chemical Reagent Institute (Tianjing, China). Azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). LiCl and DMSO were of analytical-reagent grade and were used as received.Preparation of SIPN hydrogelsLignocellulose SIPN hydrogels were prepared from wheat straw pulp according to the following procedure. Firstly, a lignocellulose solution was prepared according to our previous studies. EDA-pretreated pulp was added to 8% LiCl/DMSO solvent at room temperature with 2 wt% concentration. The suspension was continuously stirred for 24 h and then maintained at 65 \u00b0C for 5 h under stirring to obtain a homogeneous solution. After that, 1 g NIPAAm, 0.1 g MBAAm and 0.015 g AIBN were added to a tube containing 5 g wheat straw pulp-LiCl/DMSO solution with 2 wt% concentration. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until it was totally dissolved and then purged with nitrogen for 10 min. Then, it was sealed and placed in a water bath at 70 \u00b0C for 12 h to achieve gelatinization. The resulting gels were removed and washed with water for 5 days to remove the unreacted reagents, and the water was replaced every 12 h. The SIPN hydrogels prepared from LC-1, LC-2 and LC-3 were labeled as LCTG-1, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, respectively.For the cellulose/lignin composite thermo-sensitive hydrogels, different amounts of soda lignin were firstly added to 5 g LC-3/LiCl/DMSO solution, same as above, to reach the appropriate lignin contents in LC-1/LiCl/DMSO and LC-2/LiCl/DMSO. After dissolution, 1 g NIPAAm, 0.1 g MBAAm and 0.015 g AIBN were also dissolved in the solution. The mixture were then purged with nitrogen for 10 min and placed in a water bath at 70 \u00b0C for 12 h to achieve gelatinization. The obtained gels were washed with water to remove the unreacted reagents, and the water was changed every 12 h. The prepared composite hydrogels containing the same lignin contents as LCTG-1 or LCTG-2 were labeled as LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, respectively. The PNIPAAm hydrogel without lignocellulose was prepared from NIPAAm for comparison by the same procedure. The parameters for the synthesis of the thermo-sensitive hydrogels are shown in Table 1.The parameters for the synthesis of the thermo-sensitive hydrogelsSample\tRaw material (lignin contenta)\tNIPAAm (g)\tMBAAm (g)\tAIBN (g)\t \tLCTG-1\tLC-1 (4.27%), 0.100 g\t1\t0.1\t0.015\t \tLCTG-2\tLC-2 (3.25%), 0.100 g\t1\t0.1\t0.015\t \tLCTG-3\tLC-3 (2.26%), 0.100 g\t1\t0.1\t0.015\t \tLCTGs-1\tLC-3 + soda lignin (4.19%), 0.102 g\t1\t0.1\t0.015\t \tLCTGs-2\tLC-3 + soda lignin (3.22%), 0.101 g\t1\t0.1\t0.015\t \tPNIPAAm\t\u2014\t1\t0.1\t0.015\t \tThe lignin contents were calculated based on the raw materials in LiCl/DMSO before adding the monomers.Characterization of hydrogelsFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the freeze-dried hydrogels were measured by an FT-IR 650 FTIR spectrometer (Gangdong, China). 3 mg freeze-dried hydrogels were mixed with 200 mg KBr and ground into powder for FT-IR testing in the range of 4000 to 400 cm\u22121. Cross sections of the freeze-dried hydrogels were coated with gold and then observed by a Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI, USA). Nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed using a Quadrasorb-evo\u2122 Gas Sorption Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer (Quantachrome, USA). The BET surface areas (SBET) and BJH pore diameters (dv) of the freeze-dried hydrogels were determined by measuring the nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature; before the measurements, all freeze-dried hydrogels without any collapse were degassed at 60 \u00b0C for 24 h.Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were recorded on a DSC 214 (NETZSCH, Germany); 5 to 10 mg of hydrogels were heated from 10 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min\u22121 under 40 ml min\u22121 nitrogen flow. The rheological analysis of the hydrogels was performed using an RS6000 rheometer (HAAKER, Germany) with a P20 Ti L plate and a P20 Ti L cone. All samples were prepared with diameters equal to that of the P20 Ti L plate and a thickness of 4 mm. The specimens were subjected to strain sweep tests over the range of 0 to 10\u2009000 Pa at ambient temperature with a frequency of 1 Hz. The storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2032\u2032) of the hydrogels were recorded. Compression stress\u2013strain curves of the hydrogels were obtained with an AG-X plus mechanical tester (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with an SLBL 500 N load cell. Each specimen was cut into a cylinder sharp (20 mm in diameter, 8 mm in height), then vertically compressed with a speed of 1 mm min\u22121 at room temperature. The samples were measured in triplicate, and the compressive stress and strain were calculated from the measured forces and sample displacements based on the initial dimensions of the hydrogels. Static contact angles of the freeze-dried SIPN hydrogels were measured using a T200-Auto 3 Plus contact angle goniometer (BiolinScientific, Sweden) at 20 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C. A drop (4 \u03bcL) of deionized water was deposited on the surface of each sample for the contact angle measurements.The gravimetric method was employed to measure the equilibrium reswelling ratios of the freeze-dried hydrogels at different temperatures ranging from 20 \u00b0C to 45 \u00b0C. The freeze-dried samples were soaked in deionized water for 24 h at each temperature, then picked up and weighed after removing excess water on the surface with moistened filter paper. The equilibrium reswelling ratio (Qe) was calculated as follows:where ws is the weight of the equilibrated swollen gel and wd is the weight of the measured freeze-dried hydrogel sample.The absorption kinetic curve at 20 \u00b0C was determined by the absorption capacity of water at a certain time interval.Simultaneously, the oil absorbencies of the freeze-dried SIPN hydrogels were measured gravimetrically at a temperature of 45 \u00b0C. All dried samples were immersed in a soybean oil/water mixture (1\u2009:\u20094, v/v) for 24 h; then, they were weighed after removing the excess oil, and the oil absorbency of soybean oil was calculated as follows:where wd and wo are the weights of the freeze-dried hydrogel before and after oil absorption, respectively.Results and discussionFormation of SIPN hydrogelsThe lignocellulose or composite thermo-sensitive hydrogels were prepared according to the schematic in Fig. 1 through the SIPN strategy. An interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) is a combination of two or more polymers in a network. For cellulose-based hydrogels, if the cellulose is only linear or branched in the other polymerized network, the gel is a semi-IPN hydrogel. In this study, the first PNIPAAm network was formed by the polymerization of NIPAAm with MBAAm as the cross-linker and AIBN as the initiator. Meanwhile, the lignocellulose existed as rigid rods and spanned throughout the PNIPAAm network to form SIPN thermally sensitive hydrogels, in which lignocellulose has the capacity to form hydrogen bonds between lignocellulose chains. For the cellulose/lignin composite hydrogels, soda lignin was firstly dissolved in LiCl/DMSO and dispersed in the gel network with solvent. Then, it was immersed in deionized water to regenerate as particles that were dispersed in the SIPN network due to the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces among lignocellulose, PNIPAAm and soda lignin. Moreover, the entanglements of the lignocellulose fibrils and the PNIPAAm network could embrace the lignin particles in the network.Schematic of the preparation of lignocellulose or composite hydrogels through the SIPN strategy.FTIR analysis of the SIPN hydrogelsThe FT-IR spectra of the lignocellulose material (LC-3), SIPN hydrogels and PNIPAAm hydrogel are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption peak at 3433 cm\u22121 is a characteristic band of hydroxyl groups. The broad absorption peak at 3323 cm\u22121 is attributed to the stretching vibration of amino groups. The characteristic absorption peaks at 2974 cm\u22121 and 1460 cm\u22121 correspond to the asymmetric stretching vibration and asymmetric deformation vibration of methyl groups, respectively. The characteristic absorption peak at 2920 cm\u22121 is attributed to the stretching vibration of methylene groups. The bands at 1170 and 1130 cm\u22121 are due to the existence of isopropyl groups, and the bands at 1656 and 1537 cm\u22121 are assigned to the typical amide group of NIPAAm. The presence of the amide groups and hydroxyl groups in the SIPN hydrogels proved that SIPN hydrogels composed of lignocellulose and PNIPAAm were successfully synthesized.FTIR spectra of lignocellulose (LC-3), SIPN hydrogels and PNIPAAm hydrogel.Morphologies of the SIPN hydrogelsSEM images of the cross sections of the SIPN hydrogels are shown in Fig. 3. It can be clearly observed that there are large amounts of pores inside the samples, which can endow the hydrogels with good absorption capacity. For LCTG-1, the pore size was much larger than those of LCTG-2 and LCTG-3. This can be attributed to the native lignin, which restricted the dissociation of cellulose and hemicellulose chains in the raw lignocellulose LC-1. Because the lignocellulose chains in the SIPN hydrogels existed as rigid rods throughout the PNIPAAm network, the aggregation of these three components, namely lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose, would intensively restrict the reaction between the monomer and the crosslinker, which resulted in a decrement of the cross-linking ratio and an increment of the pore size. Meanwhile, in LC-2 and LC-3, certain amounts of native lignin were removed by oxygen delignification, and the cellulose and hemicellulose could dissociate gradually.SEM images of cross-sections of the SIPN hydrogels.Then, the restriction between the monomer and the crosslinker was decreased, and the interlacing of PNIPAAm and lignocellulose was increased. Thus, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3 could be obtained with denser porous morphologies. For LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, the dissolved lignin in LiCl/DMSO could also restrict the reaction between the monomer and the crosslinker, which accordingly induced much larger pores in the hydrogel network compared with that of LCTG-3.Nitrogen adsorption analysis of the hydrogelsThe nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of these hydrogels are shown in Fig. 4. All the SIPN hydrogels presented typical IV nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms. The appearance of the hysteresis loop indicated multilayer adsorption on the mesoporous material, and the prominent adsorption at high relative pressures (P/P0) is associated with capillary condensation during multilayer adsorption on the mesoporous material.Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of the SIPN hydrogels and PNIPAAm hydrogel.As shown in Table 2, PNIPAAm showed the minimum dv (17.49 nm) among all the hydrogels, and the dv values showed an obvious increase in the SIPN hydrogels. Because the presence of lignocellulose during the synthesis procedure of the SIPN gel could restrict the reaction between the monomer and the crosslinker, the cross-linking ratios were decreased and induced more pores with larger sizes; this finally resulted in larger dv values than that of the PNIPAAm hydrogel. LCTG-1 shows the minimum SBET (17.6 m2 g\u22121) and the maximum dv (31.19 nm) among the lignocellulose SIPN samples. This may be caused by the existence of native lignin, which restricted the dissociation of cellulose and hemicellulose and then decreased the interlacing of PNIPAAm and lignocellulose. As the lignin content decreases, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, which contain lignocellulose with lower native lignin contents, present greater SBET and lower dv values than LCTG-1; especially, LCTG-3 gave the greatest SBET (29.2 m2 g\u22121).BET surface areas (SBET) and BJH average pore diameters (dv) of the hydrogelsSample\tSBET (m2 g\u22121)\tdv (nm)\t \tLCTG-1\t17.6\t31.19\t \tLCTG-2\t18.3\t31.07\t \tLCTG-3\t29.2\t30.92\t \tLCTGs-1\t21.7\t31.05\t \tLCTGs-2\t28.4\t30.96\t \tPNIPAAm\t57.2\t17.49\t \tFor LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, the dissolved soda lignin in LiCl/DMSO also restricted the reaction between the monomer and crosslinker, then induced more large pores in the gel network; this resulted in larger dv and lower SBET values in LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2 compared with LCTG-3, which originated from the same LC-3. Also, SBET decreased and dv increased with increasing externally added lignin content. Furthermore, both of these hydrogels presented relatively higher SBET and smaller dv values than LCTG-1 and LCTG-2, which have the same respective lignin contents.LCST of SIPN hydrogelsThe DSC curves of the SIPN hydrogels and PNIPAAm hydrogel are shown in Fig. 5. Due to the existence of a hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance in the PNIPAAm network, these SIPN hydrogels can be sensitive to temperature variations of the external environment. If the environmental temperature is lower than the LCST, the hydrophilic groups in the PNIPAAm chains play the main role and interact with the water molecules through hydrogen bonding; then, the hydrogels are swelled by water. Meanwhile, if the environmental temperature is higher than the LCST, the carbonyl groups combine with amino groups to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds which lead to a compact PNIPAAm network; then, the hydrophilic groups are surrounded by the hydrophobic isopropyl groups, and the hydrophobic groups become the prominent part. As a result, the hydrogen bonding between the PNIPAAm chains and water is decreased, the hydrogels shrink, and the absorbed water is expelled.DSC curves of the SIPN hydrogels and PNIPAAm hydrogel.LCTG-1, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, which contain different amounts of native lignin, have the same LCST of 35 \u00b0C. These data are similar to that of the PNIPAAm hydrogel. As a result, the introduction of lignocellulose with native lignin into the PNIPAAm network through the SIPN strategy will not break the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. However, the composite hydrogels LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, which contain some amounts of externally added free lignin particles, showed LCSTs 1.3 \u00b0C higher than that of the PNIPAAm hydrogel in this system. In the networks of the composite hydrogels, the externally added lignin particles deposited on the lignocellulose chains and PNIPAAm chains by forming van der Waals forces and intermolecular hydrogen bonds with lignocellulose and PNIPAAm. This increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding can improve hydrophilic interactions and partially alter the competition between inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding interactions in the PNIPAAm system; also, the lignin particles can partially prevent interactions of the hydrophobic groups in the PNIPAAm network, consequently increasing the LCST to 36.3 \u00b0C.Mechanical properties of the SIPN hydrogelsThe influence of lignin on the mechanical properties of the hydrogels is presented in Fig. 6 and 7, which show the corresponding viscoelastic and compressive properties. The storage modulus (G\u2032) and loss modulus (G\u2032\u2032) in stress sweeps of the SIPN hydrogels correspond to the elasticity and viscosity of the materials, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the G\u2032 values of all the samples are much higher than the G\u2032\u2032 values, and the G\u2032 values of the SIPN hydrogels are much higher than that of the PNIPAAm hydrogel. This proves that all the hydrogels are typical elastic gels and that the introduction of lignocellulose into the PNIPAAm network can effectively improve the viscoelasticity of the hydrogels. This can be attributed to the physical entanglement of poly-NIPAAm and lignocellulose, which extended as rigid rods and structural supports in the SIPN hydrogel network.Stress sweeps of the SIPN hydrogels and PNIPAAm hydrogel.Compression stress\u2013strain curves of the hydrogels.As the oxygen delignification increased, G\u2032 of LCTG-1, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3 gradually increased from 6344 to 12\u2009018 Pa. This indicates that delignification is beneficial to improve the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels. Because the presence of native lignin could restrict the dissociation of cellulose and hemicellulose, the aggregation of these three components limited the crosslinking of the PNIPAAm network. Thus, the resulting loose structures and large pore sizes decreased the G\u2032 value. However, for the composite SIPN hydrogels LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, the values of G\u2032 are 19\u2009515 and 28\u2009997 Pa. These were much higher than that of LCTG-3. In the composite SIPN hydrogel network, the embedded lignin particles acted as spacers and restricted the movement of the polymer chains, which induced the increase of the storage modulus (G\u2032). This proves that the external addition of soda lignin is helpful to improve the viscoelasticity of the hydrogels.The compressive strength of a hydrogel is an important property for many actual applications. Also, it represents the ability of the hydrogel to resist the external load under compression. The compressive stress\u2013strain curves of the fabricated hydrogels are presented in Fig. 7. It can be observed that introduction of lignocellulose into the PNIPAAm network could also lead to higher compressive stress. At 60% strain, the compressive stress of LCTGs-2 was as high as 2.2 MPa, 21 times higher than that of the PNIPAAm hydrogel. For LCTG-1, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, the compressive stresses at 60% strain increased with decreasing lignin content. As the oxygen delignification increased, cellulose and hemicellulose could be dissociated gradually with the removal of lignin, and the restriction between the monomers and crosslinker was decreased. Thus, LCTG-3 with lower lignin content possessed a relatively denser porous morphology, leading to higher compressive strength. Meanwhile, for the composite SIPN hydrogels, the stresses of LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2 at 60% strain were 2.0 and 2.2 MPa, which were higher than that of LCTG-3. As indicated above, the externally added lignin dispersed in the SIPN network and acted as spacers which could facilitate the transfer of the compressive stress, thus enhancing the resistance to external compression. These results prove that the external addition of soda lignin is beneficial to improve the mechanical strength of the hydrogels.Reswelling of SIPN hydrogelsThe equilibrium reswelling ratios (Qe) of the SIPN hydrogels in deionized water at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 8. It was observed that all the SIPN hydrogels exhibited classical thermosensitivity. As the temperature increased from 20 \u00b0C to 45 \u00b0C, the Qe showed a significant decrease. The obvious dimensional changes of the samples in the inserted images further indicated their thermoresponsiveness. Generally, if the temperature is below the LCST, the whole hydrogel network is well swollen due to the hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic groups and water. However, if the temperature becomes higher than the LCST, the hydrophobicity of the polymer chains is stronger than their hydrophilicity, and the reswelling ratios decrease accordingly.Equilibrium reswelling ratios of the hydrogels at different temperatures and images of an SIPN hydrogel (LCTG-3) at 20 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C after equilibrium reswelling in deionized water.For LCTG-1, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, the Qe decreased with increasing oxygen delignification, which could decrease the native lignin content in the hydrogels. Combining the nitrogen adsorption analysis of these three hydrogels, their dv values decreased and their SBET values gradually improved with decreasing lignin content. All these results suggest that the presence of native lignin, which restricted the dissociation of cellulose and hemicellulose, may be helpful to form pores with relatively large sizes; these large pores are conducive to improving the corresponding water uptake capacity and to obtaining better Qe. However, for LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, both their Qe values are slightly lower than that of LCTG-3, which contains the minimum amount of lignin. In the networks of composite hydrogels LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, the externally added lignin particles were deposited on the lignocellulose and PNIPAAm chains or dispersed within the hydrogel network. This could partially restrict the extension of the hydrated polymer chains when the hydrogels were swelled in distilled water. Additionally, these lignin particles are hydrophobic; they could also limit the water absorption capacities of the hydrogels, especially in LCTGs-1, which contains the maximum amount of externally added lignin. Fig. 9a displays the water absorption kinetics of the SIPN gels at 20 \u00b0C. It can be observed that all the samples could reach equilibrium swelling after 6 h. Also, LCTG-1 showed a faster reswelling rate than LCTG-2 or LCTG-3. Generally, there are three steps for hydrogel reswelling upon immersion in distilled water: diffusion of water into the polymer network, relaxation of hydrated polymer chains and subsequent expansion of the polymer network into the distilled water. Therefore, the interior morphology of the hydrogels is important to their reswelling rate. For lignocellulose SIPN hydrogels LCTG-1, LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, the decreased pore size could restrict the diffusion of water into the network and the extension of the hydrated polymer chains, resulting in a decrease of the reswelling rate from LCTG-1 to LCTG-3. Meanwhile, for LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2, the externally added lignin particles deposited on the lignocellulose chains and PNIPAAm chains could partially restrict the extension of the hydrated polymer chains, resulting in a decrease of the reswelling rate.Water absorption kinetics of SIPN hydrogels at 20 \u00b0C (a) and pseudo-first-order kinetic model plots (b).The water absorption kinetics were evaluated with the pseudo-first-order model, which is expressed as:where Qe and Qt are the water absorption capacities (g g\u22121) at equilibrium swelling and at a given time t (min), respectively, and k is the swelling kinetic constant.The swelling kinetic constant k was determined from the slope of the plot of ln(Qe \u2013 Qt) versus t, as shown in Fig. 9b. It can be seen that the water absorption process basically obeys first-order absorption kinetics. Also, the k values of LCTG-1, LCTG-2, LCTG-3, LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2 are 0.0100, 0.0098, 0.0091, 0.0086 and 0.0089, respectively; this indicates that LCTG-1, which has relatively large pore sizes, has the highest water absorption speed at 20 \u00b0C.Oil absorbency of the SIPN gels at 45 \u00b0CThe hydrophobic properties of the SIPN gels at 45 \u00b0C were further demonstrated by their water contact angles (WCA). As shown in Fig. 10, all the SIPN gels exhibited rapid conversion from hydrophilicity (WCA = 0\u00b0) at 20 \u00b0C to hydrophobicity (WCA > 90\u00b0) at 45 \u00b0C. Also, the WCA values of the samples increased with increasing lignin content. Meanwhile, on the basis of the above work, the as-prepared SIPN gels were employed to absorb soybean oil from oily water at 45 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 10. When immersed in the oil/water mixture at a higher temperature, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds that formed between the CO groups and N\u2013H groups led to a compact PNIPAAm network; thus, the hydrophilic groups were surrounded by isopropyl groups. Then, the hydrophobic groups remaining on the surface of the skeleton played the leading role, resulting in hydrophobic and oil-absorbing gels with potential applications for oil/water separation.Water contact angles (WCA) of the SIPN gels at 45 \u00b0C in air and oil absorbencies of the SIPN gels at 45 \u00b0C.In Fig. 10, LCTG-1 shows the highest oil absorbency among these samples at 45 \u00b0C. Considering the SEM and BET results, the presence of native lignin, which restricted the dissociation of cellulose and hemicellulose, may be helpful to form pores with relatively large sizes; these large pores inside the gels endow them with better oil absorption performance at 45 \u00b0C, which is above their LCST. As a result, for LCTG-2 and LCTG-3, the oil absorbency decreased with decreasing lignin content. For the same reason, the oil absorbencies of LCTGs-1 and LCTGs-2 were slightly higher than that of LCTG-3. Additionally, lignin is a hydrophobic component, and its presence may also lead to higher hydrophobic character and improve the oil absorption performance.ConclusionsA series of thermo-sensitive lignocellulose hydrogels were fabricated with NIPAAm through the SIPN strategy. All the SIPN hydrogels exhibited more favorable mechanical properties than the signal PNIPAAm network due to their physical entanglement, and the externally added lignin in the composite hydrogels was beneficial to obtain better mechanical strength. Also, the lignin present in the hydrogel network resulted in the formation of large pores, and it may be possible to tailor the mechanical properties and morphologies of the hydrogels by varying the existential state and content of lignin. Furthermore, the resulting SIPN hydrogels exhibited classical thermosensitivity, showing good switching between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity below and above the LCST. Also, the presence of lignin could further improve the hydrophobicity of the gels. With this special switching, the SIPN gels could be used to absorb oil from an oil/water mixture at 45 \u00b0C, showing potential applications in oil/water separation.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts to declare.Supplementary MaterialNotes and references"

Morphologies and sizes of exosomes were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and particle size analysis respectively.

PKH67 labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 were incubated with NFs or MCF-7 to measure the activation of CAFs. Cell invasion and migration abilities were determined by scratch test and Transwell assay. Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1 were successfully extracted with positive expressions of Alix, CD63 and TSG101. Contents of Ki67, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail-1 were increased but E-cadherin was decreased, compared to Exo-MA group. Exo-M7 or Exo-M1 could increase BC cell proliferation and enhance EMT in nude mouse. Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 could accelerate the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote the recruitment of CAFs in MCF-7. Transfection of miR-146a could promote the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote cell invasion and migration of MCF-7\u00a0cells. As a target gene of miR-146a, TXNIP could inhibit the activation of CAFs. miR-146a overexpression or TXNIP silence enhance the activation of Wnt signal pathway. BC-derived exosomes promote the activation of CAFs through miR-146a/TXNIP axis to activate Wnt pathway, which in turn enhances invasion and metastasis of BC cells.",

Cancer progression is the result of complex cross-talk between neoplastic cells and neighbouring stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and inflammatory cells. Gene expression profiling of neoplastic epithelium and stroma during breast cancer progression revealed that the expression of molecules involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is altered during the transition from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Extensive stromal gene expression alterations also occur during the transition from normal breast to DCIS. Gevaert et al. reported overexpression of the small leucin-rich proteoglycans (SLRP) decorin and fibromodulin in a gene expression signature associated with good prognosis in invasive breast cancer. Decreased stromal decorin and lumican correlated with worse prognosis in lymph node-negative invasive breast cancer. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed that stromal decorin expression is highest in normal breast tissue, lower in DCIS and lowest in IDC. A similar trend was noticed in the colon, with strong decorin expression in normal tissue, hyperplastic adenomas and the majority of tubular adenomas, and decreased decorin expression in tubulo-villous adenomas and most adenocarcinomas.We recently observed that decreased periductal decorin immunoreactivity correlated with the presence of myxoid stromal architecture in DCIS. Reduced stromal decorin and myxoid stroma were both significantly associated with an increased recurrence risk in DCIS. As not all DCIS will evolve to IDC, stromal alterations might enable the identification of lesions that possess the capability to progress. We hypothesized that decreased stromal decorin may contribute to the pathogenesis of myxoid stroma, as decorin seems to play an important role in collagen fibrillogenesis. Myxoid stroma and the associated decorin reduction might mirror the propensity of some DCIS lesions to progress to IDC. Neoplastic lesions may induce ECM alterations through paracrine corruption of fibroblasts, resulting in an invasion-permissive stroma. In this study, we aimed to investigate paracrine regulation of stromal decorin expression, as well as related ECM protein expression. Immortalized CAF were used as an in vitro model. In vitro findings were translated to the clinical setting by performing IHC on DCIS specimens. In addition, we investigated the effect of decorin and CAF-derived matrices on cancer cell adhesion. The main goal of this study was to gain more insight in cancer-induced changes in the peritumoral ECM, since this might aid the identification of new therapeutic targets, as well as novel prognostic markers.RESULTSTGF-\u03b21 and bFGF suppress decorin expression at the protein levelWe screened ten cytokines for the differential regulation of decorin expression in CAFs. TGF-\u03b21and bFGF were the strongest suppressors of decorin expression, followed by TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b11 and EGF (Figure 1A). TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF treatment resulted in 10-fold and 5-fold downregulation, respectively. Additionally, we assessed the effect of these cytokines on \u03b1-SMA expression, as this molecule is often presented as a CAF-marker. Expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs was 8-fold upregulated by TGF-\u03b21, whereas bFGF, EGF and TGF-\u03b11 completely suppressed \u03b1-SMA expression, as previously observed. The differential regulation of \u03b1-SMA and decorin prompted us to select bFGF, EGF and TGF-\u03b21 for further experiments. Next, CAFs were treated with bFGF, EGF and TGF-\u03b21 in three concentrations. Downregulation of decorin expression was only observed when cells were treated with the highest concentration of 10 ng/ml (Figure 1B). A concentration of 1 ng/ml bFGF, EGF or TGF-\u03b21 exerted distinct effects on \u03b1-SMA expression, and these were magnified by increasing the concentration to 10 ng/ml. Therefore, we selected the latter for subsequent experiments.Cytokine treatment influences ECM protein expression in CAFs(A) Western blot showing the effect of treatment of CAFs with ten different growth factors (all at a concentration of 10 ng/ml) on the expression of decorin and \u03b1-SMA.

(C) Table displaying the normalized mRNA expression profile of five SLRP's, two hyalectans, type 1 collagen and \u03b1-SMA in CAFs after treatment with bFGF, EGF or TGF-\u03b21, either alone or in combination (10 ng/ml). Red and blue color scales represent 2-, 5- and 10-fold up- and downregulation, respectively. Values are mean \u00b1 SD and represent 3 independent experiments.TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF differentially modulate ECM protein expressionCAFs were treated with bFGF, EGF and TGF-\u03b21 at 10 ng/ml, either alone or in combination. RT-qPCR was performed to assess the mRNA expression of ACTA2, COL1A1, five SLRP's (ASPN, BGN, DCN, FMOD, LUM) and two hyalectans (VCAN and ACAN). EGF did not exert significant effects on mRNA expression (Figure 1C). ACTA2 was about 4-fold downregulated by bFGF and >6-fold upregulated by TGF-\u03b21. When bFGF and TGF-\u03b21 were combined, the stimulatory TGF-\u03b21 effect was almost completely counteracted by bFGF, while EGF was not able to neutralize this TGF-\u03b21 effect (Figure 1C).BGN and VCAN displayed a similar mRNA expression pattern: both were strongly induced by TGF-\u03b21, and this was enhanced by bFGF, resulting in a >15-fold upregulation of BGN and a >100-fold upregulation of VCAN (Figure 1C). COL1A1 expression was almost 10-fold induced by TGF-\u03b21, though this was attenuated by bFGF. ASPN expression was 3-fold stimulated by TGF-\u03b21, but bFGF did not significantly influence its expression. Three other SLRP's were expressed alike: DCN, FMOD and LUM were all downregulated by bFGF and this effect was enhanced by TGF-\u03b21. ACAN, a hyalectan, was 4-fold upregulated by TGF-\u03b21 but this effect was attenuated by EGF, whereas the combination of bFGF and TGF-\u03b21 caused a 3-fold downregulation. Altogether, these findings point to differential regulation of ECM proteins, with upregulation of versican, biglycan, COL1A1 and \u03b1-SMA as a signature of TGF-\u03b21-induced protein expression. This experiment was repeated to confirm the aforementioned RT-qPCR results at the protein level by Western blotting. TGF-\u03b21 strongly induced versican, biglycan and \u03b1-SMA, and caused downregulation of decorin in fibroblasts. Similar to the RT-qPCR findings, bFGF treatment only had a moderate effect on the upregulation of versican and biglycan, whereas it effectively suppressed decorin and \u03b1-SMA expression. When bFGF was combined with TGF-\u03b21, the stimulatory TGF-\u03b21 effect on \u03b1-SMA expression was clearly attenuated, whereas decorin downregulation and biglycan and versican upregulation were enhanced (Figure 2A).Treatment of CAFs with combined cytokines or cancer cell-derived secretomes affects ECM protein expression(A) Western blot showing the effects of bFGF, EGF and TGF-\u03b21 treatment (10 ng/ml) on the expression of biglycan, decorin, \u03b1-SMA and versican in CAFs. (B) Western blot illustrating the effects of treatment with cancer cell-derived conditioned medium (CM) on the expression of biglycan, decorin, \u03b1-SMA and versican in CAFs. TGF-\u03b21 treatment (1 and 10 ng/ml) was included as a positive control. Tubulin was used as loading control (A, B).Cancer cell-derived secretomes affect ECM protein expression in CAFsConditioned medium (CM) was collected from six breast cancer cell lines and four colorectal cancer cell lines. CAFs were treated with this CM for 6 days. Fibroblasts treated with TGF-\u03b21 (1 and 10 ng/ml) were included as a positive control (Figure 2B). Although CM of almost every cancer cell line caused a slight to moderate upregulation of \u03b1-SMA, CM of MDA-MB-231 caused a distinct increase in \u03b1-SMA expression. Simultaneously, it was the most potent suppressor of decorin expression and the strongest inducer of biglycan and versican. CM of all breast and colorectal cancer cell lines enhanced versican and biglycan expression. SKBR3 was the only other breast cancer cell line of which CM downregulated decorin. Remarkably, CM of all colorectal cancer cell lines caused increased decorin expression, but presently we cannot explain this differential regulation.Immunohistochemical evaluation of ECM protein expressionSince we previously reported a significant association between periductal myxoid stroma and reduced stromal decorin in DCIS, we aimed to investigate whether a correlation existed between myxoid stroma and increased biglycan and versican immunoreactivity. IHC was performed on eight myxoid DCIS, and twelve DCIS with sclerotic stroma. In DCIS with low stromal versican, 3 of 11 (27%) lesions presented myxoid stroma, while DCIS with high stromal versican counted 5 of 8 (63%) myxoid cases (Figure 3A-B). Despite this trend, statistical significance was not reached (p=0.181), which is likely due to lack of power. Calculated power amounted only 0.197 (\u03b2=0.803). Stromal biglycan expression was not able to discern myxoid from sclerotic DCIS (Figure 3C-D): in DCIS with low to moderate stromal biglycan, 7 of 14 (50%) DCIS presented myxoid stroma, while 1 of 6 DCIS (17%) with high stromal biglycan had myxoid stroma (p=0.325) (Figure 4).Comparison of stromal versican and biglycan expression in DCIS lesions with sclerotic or myxoid stroma(A) Bar chart displaying the relation between stromal versican expression and stromal architecture. Despite a trend toward high versican expression in DCIS with myxoid stroma, statistical significance was not reached (p=0.181), due to lack of power (\u03b2=0.803).

Panels A-C-E-G display photographs of one DCIS lesion with sclerotic stroma; panels B-D-F-H display one DCIS lesion with myxoid stroma. This figure illustrates that myxoid DCIS present reduced periductal decorin staining and tend to have increased periductal versican and biglycan expression, whereas sclerotic DCIS generally present strong stromal decorin immunoreactivity, and tend to lack stromal versican and biglycan. Original magnification 100x.Decorin negatively influences cancer cell adhesionIn addition to paracrine regulation of stromal protein expression, we aimed to investigate the effects of decorin on cancer cell adhesion. Human recombinant His-tagged decorin was purified from CM of decorin-overexpressing HEK-293-EBNA-DCN cells. Western blotting confirmed purification of both His-tagged core protein (50 kDa) and glycosylated decorin (75-160 kDa). As a quality control, purified decorin was incubated with chondroitinase ABC, a chondroitin and dermatan sulphate degrading enzyme. After digestion, Western blotting showed that only His-tagged core protein remained (results not shown).Three colorectal cancer cell lines (CaCo-2, HCT8/ E11 and SW480) and three breast cancer cell lines (BT474, SKBR3 and T47D) were seeded onto coatings of purified decorin in different concentrations, or type I collagen (10 \u03bcg/ml in PBS). Multiple cell lines were used to exclude a cell line specific effect. Experiments were performed in duplicate, to quantify adhesion by SRB staining and to assess effects of the coatings on cell metabolism by MTT assays. Collagen coatings did not affect cell adhesion as compared with PBS control (Figure 5A-D), but significantly increased metabolic activity in CaCo-2 cells was observed (p=0.015). Decorin coatings inhibited attachment of all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. This anti-adhesive effect was statistically significant when a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml decorin was used (p\u22640.007 for all cell lines) and was even more distinct with 10 \u03bcg/ml decorin (p\u22640.002 for all cell lines). Altogether, these findings indicate that cancer cells attach to type I collagen, but they are not able to attach to decorin as a single substrate.SRB and MTT adhesion assays with cancer cells seeded onto coatings containing type I collagen and decorin(A-D) Bar charts displaying the effect of pure decorin coatings and a type I collagen coating on cancer cell adhesion, as measured by MTT (A,C) and SRB (B,D) assays. (E-H) Bar charts illustrating the effect of different concentrations of decorin on cancer cell adhesion when added to a type I collagen coating (10 \u03bcg/ml in PBS), as measured by MTT (E,G) and SRB (F,H) assays. All experiments were performed with three breast and three colorectal cancer cell lines, to exclude a cell line specific effect. Results are presented from five wells per assay from three independent experiments. Values are mean percentage \u00b1 SD. \u00b0 p<0.05 and * p<0.001 as compared with control. Col: type I collagen; DCN: decorin.We wondered whether decorin exerted anti-adhesive effects in the presence of type I collagen. Experiments were repeated with combined coatings, containing 10 \u03bcg/ ml type I collagen and varying amounts of purified decorin (range 1-20 \u03bcg/ml). When cell adhesion was assessed by SRB assay, BT474 and HCT8/E11 were the only cell lines of which adhesion was significantly decreased when 20 \u03bcg/ml decorin was added to the coating (p<0.001 and p=0.030, respectively). BT474 was the only cancer cell line of which the metabolism significantly diminished when 5 \u03bcg/ml decorin or more was added to the type I collagen coating (p<0.001). The highest decorin concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml also decreased cell metabolism in SKBR3 (p=0.010), T47D (p=0.020), CaCo-2 (p=0.009) and HCT8/E11 (p<0.001). Overall, type I collagen clearly counteracted the anti-adhesive effect of decorin (Figure 5 E-H).In addition, cell adhesion was assessed by an electrical impedance assay (Figure 6). BT474 and CaCo-2 cells were seeded onto coatings containing decorin, type I collagen or both. Decorin significantly inhibited adhesion in these cell lines (p=0.001 for both) compared with control coatings. Pure type I collagen coatings significantly enhanced adhesion of CaCo-2 cells compared with control coatings (p=0.001) or collagen/decorin coatings (p=0.021). Type I collagen coatings exerted an early stimulatory effect on adhesion of BT474 cells compared with control coatings, which caused a significant difference between the slopes of both curves (p=0.001). Addition of decorin to the type I collagen coating slightly diminished the cell index of BT474 cells, but did not affect the slope of the curve (p=0.834).Real-time monitoring of cancer cell adhesion on decorin and type I collagen coatingsReal-time monitoring of cell adhesion of BT474 (A) and CaCo-2 (B) cells by measuring electrical impedance during 24h. The cell index, i.e. the change in electrical impedance, is displayed in function of time (in hours) as mean \u00b1 SD. Cells were seeded on coatings containing PBS only (blue), type I collagen (green), decorin (red) or type I collagen combined with decorin (purple).CAF-derived matricesIn addition to adhesion assays on single or dual reagent coatings, we attempted to mimic the in vivo situation by seeding cancer cells on CAF-derived matrices. Matrices were prepared as described by Castello-Cros et al., and CAFs were treated six days with bFGF, TGF-\u03b21 or both. After CAF removal, the remaining matrices were coated with decorin (20 or 50 \u03bcg/ml) or PBS control. Cancer cells were seeded onto matrices with or without decorin coating, and MTT and SRB adhesion assays were carried out after 24h incubation. These adhesion assays revealed no significant differences in cell adhesion (Figures 7-8). Moreover, application of decorin coatings on the matrices did not significantly inhibit adhesion, which is in line with the adhesion assays with combined coatings, where type I collagen counteracted the anti-adhesive effect of decorin. As CAFs produce type I collagen, a sufficient amount was present to neutralize the applied decorin coating.Adhesion assays with SW480 cells seeded onto CAF-derived matricesSW480 cells were seeded onto CAF-derived matrices with or without decorin coating, and cell adhesion was measured by MTT (A) and SRB (B) assay after 24 hours. Results are presented from three wells per assay from two independent experiments. Values are mean percentage \u00b1 SD. CAFs that produced the matrices were treated either with vehicle control, bFGF, TGF-\u03b21 or both cytokines. (C) When seeded on matrices derived from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, elongated SW480 cells adhered in a highly organized fashion along preformed \u2018tracks\u2019 in the matrices, whereas the control or bFGF treatment showed a rather random distribution of the cells. Scale bar: 200 \u03bcm.Adhesion assays with T47D cells seeded onto CAF-derived matricesT47D cells were seeded onto CAF-derived matrices with or without decorin coating, and cell adhesion was measured by MTT (A) and SRB (B) assay after 24 hours. Results are presented from three wells per assay from two independent experiments. Values are mean percentage \u00b1 SD. CAFs that produced the matrices were treated either with vehicle control, bFGF, TGF-\u03b21 or both cytokines. (C) When seeded on matrices derived from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, T47D cells adhered in an organized fashion along preformed \u2018tracks\u2019 in the matrices, whereas the control or bFGF treatment showed a rather random distribution of the cells, with formation of more and larger cellular islands. Scale bar: 200 \u03bcm.However, phase-contrast microscopic analysis revealed morphological differences in the way cancer cells adhered to different matrices. SW480 cells, representative for colorectal cancer cells, and T47D, representative for breast cancer cells, are shown in Figure 7C and 8C, respectively. Cancer cells seeded on matrices derived from TGF-\u03b21-treated fibroblasts seemed to attach along preformed \u2018tracks\u2019, compared with the random adhesion pattern of cells seeded on matrices from untreated or bFGF-treated CAFs. This phenomenon was most distinct with SW480 cells, which was probably due to their mesenchymal aspect: most SW480 cells are already spindle-shaped and therefore their uniform orientation was more obvious. We excluded that this phenomenon was due to TGF-\u03b21 remnants in the matrices, by seeding TGF-\u03b21-treated (1 \u03bcg/ml) cancer cells on matrices from untreated fibroblasts. All cell lines adhered in the same random pattern as cancer cells seeded on control matrices without TGF-\u03b21 (results not shown).The rate of cancer cell spreading was quantified by determining the factor shape of twenty cells on each matrix (Figure 9). This was not possible for the BT474 and CaCo-2 cell lines, as these grow in dense islands in which separate cells cannot be distinguished. SW480 and T47D cancer cells presented enhanced spreading when seeded on matrices from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, which is reflected by the significantly altered cell shapes (p=0.010 and p=0.046, respectively). There was a trend toward increased cell spreading when seeded on matrices of bFGF/TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, though not statistically significant. HCT8/ E11 cells showed a trend towards enhanced cell spreading on matrices from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, and distinct alterations on matrices from bFGF/TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs (p<0.001). SKBR3 cells displayed only limited, statistically non-significant alterations in cell spreading and factor shape. Although some SKBR3 cells displayed a more irregular shape, the majority retained its epitheloid morphology (Figure 9D). Altogether, the results of these experiments indicate that TGF-\u03b21-induced modulation of the tumor microenvironment affects cancer cell spreading but not adhesion.Quantification of cancer cell spreading on CAF-derived matricesBox plots illustrating the extent of cell spreading of SW480 (A), T47D (B), HCT8/E11 (C) and SKBR3 (D) cells on matrices as quantified by factor shape (= inverse circularity or P2/4\u03c0A). Matrices are derived from untreated CAFs and CAFs treated with bFGF, TGF-\u03b21 or both. When seeded on matrices from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, SW480 and T47D cancer cells presented enhanced spreading, which is mirrored by the significantly altered cell shapes. HCT8/ E11 cells showed a trend towards enhanced cell spreading on matrices from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs, and significant alterations on matrices from bFGF/TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs. SKBR3 cells displayed only limited, statistically non-significant alterations in cell spreading and factor shape.

Such alterations are reflected in the stromal architecture of DCIS of the breast, since we recently observed that the presence of periductal myxoid stroma is a potential prognostic marker for increased recurrence risk in DCIS. Myxoid stroma was strongly associated with reduced stromal decorin expression. As decorin plays an important role in the assembly of collagen fibrils, decreased stromal decorin may contribute to the development of myxoid stroma. In this study, we identified TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF as potent decorin suppressors in CAFs. In addition, TGF-\u03b21 demonstrated to be an overall powerful ECM modulator, as it strongly upregulated type I collagen, versican and biglycan. Similar effects, though less pronounced, were observed by treating CAFs with bFGF or cancer-cell derived CM.Expression of \u03b1-SMA was differentially regulated by TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF: both cytokines downregulated decorin and upregulated versican, whereas \u03b1-SMA was induced by the former and suppressed by the latter, in accordance with previous studies. This might explain the previously reported lack of correlation between myxoid stroma and stromal \u03b1-SMA expression in DCIS, despite the distinct association between stromal architecture and decorin expression. It would be of interest to determine if versican is a more robust CAF marker than \u03b1-SMA. As bFGF downregulates \u03b1-SMA but induces versican, some CAFs might be \u03b1-SMA-negative but versican-positive, depending on the predominant cytokine production by adjacent neoplastic cells. Nevertheless, secretome experiments show that nearly all breast and colorectal cancer cell lines induce both \u03b1-SMA, versican and biglycan in CAFs, which implies TGF-\u03b21-like effects. Similar observations were reported by others. Co-cultures of CaCo-2 or HT29 cells with canine mammary stromal cells resulted in TGF-\u03b21-induced versican expression. Coulson-Thomas et al. observed that direct cell-cell contact of CaCo-2 or HCT116 with fibroblasts induced an increased expression of collagens and biglycan in the latter. TGF-\u03b21 and CM from pancreatic cancer cells synergistically suppressed decorin and lumican, and stimulated versican expression in pancreatic stellate cells. CM of all colorectal cancer cell lines upregulated decorin expression, while CM of the majority of the breast cancer cell lines caused decorin suppression. We speculate that TGF-\u03b21-induced decorin downregulation is counteracted by another, presently unknown, ligand in colorectal cancer CM. Despite this finding, stromal decorin seems to be consistently downregulated in different types of cancer compared with normal tissue, as demonstrated by Bozoky et al.. Decrease of stromal decorin during colorectal and breast cancer progression has also been shown by others.Stromal biglycan expression was not related to stromal architecture, but a trend was noted for stromal versican expression, as myxoid DCIS displayed twice as often increased versican immunoreactivity. Various studies have demonstrated increased stromal versican expression in tumors compared with normal tissue, such as in cancer of prostate, breast, colon, pancreas and ovary. Versican formed part of a 74-gene profile that classified IDC and DCIS, and revealed to be upregulated in IDC. Canavese et al. studied versican in a DCIS cohort without available outcome data. Stromal versican expression defined a specific subtype of DCIS, characterized by high nuclear grade and often presenting comedonecrosis. We speculate that the majority of DCIS with high periductal versican will also present myxoid stroma and reduced decorin expression, and patients with such lesions may be more likely to relapse. Stromal versican overexpression has been investigated in patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer and was associated with reduced relapse-free survival. In colorectal cancer, upregulated biglycan expression was associated with an increased risk of both lymph node and distant metastasis. Future research on large patient cohorts is warranted to explore the value of stromal versican and biglycan expression as a prognostic marker for recurrence in DCIS.In addition, we investigated the influence of decorin on cancer cell adhesion. Decorin effectively inhibited adhesion of both breast and colorectal cancer cells, although this was counteracted by type I collagen. According to Kenny et al., ovarian cancer cells preferentially adhere to and invade type I collagen. As the mammary stroma contains more than just decorin and type I collagen, we attempted to mimic the in vivo situation by preparing CAF-derived matrices. Consequently, matrices from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs hold higher versican and biglycan levels and lower decorin levels than matrices from untreated CAFs. Nevertheless, no significant quantitative differences in adhesion were noted between the various matrices, although cancer cells displayed a distinct \u2018track-like\u2019 spreading pattern when seeded on matrices from TGF-\u03b21-treated CAFs. We surmise that decorin is part of a stromal barrier, preventing cancer cell spreading and thus invasion. Consequently, neoplastic cells need to modulate the ECM composition to overcome this stromal barrier and to create an invasion-permissive stroma. Such modulations can exist of paracrine regulation of ECM protein expression, which includes downregulation of decorin expression and upregulation of versican, biglycan and type I collagen.We are aware that other mechanisms may contribute as well. In our study we omitted to address enzymatic remodeling of the stroma. Hawinkels et al. described that cancer cell derived TGF-\u03b21 turns fibroblasts into \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs that produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). Release of MMP in the stromal compartment could contribute to the breakdown of anti-adhesive proteoglycans like decorin. According to Imai et al., decorin contains cleavage sites for MMP-2 (gelatinase-A), MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) and MMP-7 (matrilysin). Gene expression profiling revealed that transition of in situ to invasive breast cancer was characterized by an increased expression of MMP in the stroma. Other protease classes, suchs as cathepsins, may digest decorin as well. Proteolytic activity is also required to activate TGF-\u03b21, since this cytokine is secreted as a latent molecule and sequestered by several ECM components. The ECM acts as a reservoir for cytokines, and decorin is able to bind TGF-\u03b21. Proteolytic degradation of decorin results in release of this sequestered TGF-\u03b21.TGF-\u03b21 is an attractive candidate for targeted therapy, as this might prevent extensive stromal alterations during cancer progression. Lifetime exposure to a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist protected mice against metastasis without adverse side effects. According to Liu et al., TGF-\u03b2 blockade in orthotopic mammary carcinoma mouse models significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis. Interestingly, this TGF-\u03b2 blockade decreased the type I collagen content, which contributed to normalization of the tumor stroma and improved intratumoral penetration of therapeutics. Further elucidation of ECM changes and their role in cancer progression is warranted. Naba et al. developed a proteomic strategy to determine the in vivo ECM composition of tumors and normal tissues. Such a characterization of the \u2018matrisome\u2019 revealed that tumor-and stroma-derived ECM components differ among tumors with different metastatic potential. This new strategy offers perspectives for future ECM analysis.In conclusion, preinvasive tumoral lesions may shape the composition of the adjacent ECM through TGF-\u03b21 release to secure an invasion-permissive microenvironment. Versican may be a more robust CAF-marker than \u03b1-SMA, although further research is warranted. Additional investigations on larger patient cohorts are required to elucidate the ability of altered stromal protein expression as prognostic marker in breast and colorectal cancer in general, and in DCIS of the breast in particular.METHODSCell culture and conditioned mediumTelomerase-immortalized human colon cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 2.5 \u03bcg/ ml fungizone (Life Technologies, Ghent, Belgium). Isolation and characterization of the CAFs was previously described. Experiments were performed with human breast cancer cell lines BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, SKBR3 and T47D, and human colorectal cancer cell lines CaCo-2, HCT8/E11, HT-29 and SW480. All cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, fungizone and antibiotics, except CaCo-2 cells (additionally supplemented with 5 \u03bcg/ml transferrin and 1% MEM-NEAA or non-essential amino acids solution; Life Technologies), and HT-29 (McCoy's medium supplemented with antibiotics, fungizone and 10% FCS; Life Technologies). Serum-free 10x concentrated conditioned medium (CM) derived from 3\u00d7107 cancer cells was obtained after 24h of incubation and prepared as previously described. HEK-293-EBNA-DCN cells (kindly provided by dr. Ake Oldberg, Lund University, Sweden) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, antibiotics and fungizone, and 100 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies) for selection. CM from HEK-293-EBNA-DCN cells containing His-tagged human recombinant decorin was collected after 48h of incubation and 10x concentrated with Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore, Overijse, Belgium). Concentrated CM was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until decorin purification.Reagents and experimental set-upThe following human recombinant proteins were used: bFGF (PeproTech EC, London, UK), EGF, TGF-\u03b1 (both by Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), IGF-1, IL-6, IL-8, NRG-\u03b21, OSM, TGF-\u03b21 and TNF-\u03b11 (all by R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). CAFs were grown in T-25 tissue culture flasks and treatment with cytokines (in the presence of 10% FCS) or CM (in the presence of 5% FCS) started when 95% confluence was reached. Medium was changed every 48h. After 6 days of treatment, cell lysates or RNA samples were prepared.Cell lysates, SDS-PAGE and Western blotsCAFs were harvested in Laemmli lysis buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), pH 6.8). Lysates were suspended in reducing sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, 40% glycerol, 9.2% SDS, 4.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.011% bromophenolblue, pH 6.8) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Equal protein amounts were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich), and immunostained. The following antibodies were used: anti-\u03b1 Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA, clone 1A4, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-biglycan (H-150, SantaCruzBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-decorin (clone 115402, R&D Systems), anti-versican (H-56, SantaCruz Biotechnology). Detection was performed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (all GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were stripped with ReBlot Plus mild antibody stripping solution (Merck Millipore) and reprobed with anti-\u03b1-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control. Quantification of protein expression was performed with ImageJ software (NIH, MD, USA).RNA-isolation and RT-qPCR analysisCAFs were trypsinized and cell pellets were washed twice with RNase-free water. RNA was isolated with the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), cDNA synthesis was performed with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and RT-qPCR analysis was performed on the MyiQ RT-PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) by using Mesa Green qPCR MasterMix Plus (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Selection was based on stromal architecture and availability of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. IHC for decorin and \u03b1-SMA has previously been performed. IHC for versican (dilution 1/25, HPA004726, Atlas Antibodies, Stockholm, Sweden) and biglycan (dilution 1/200, HPA003157, Atlas Antibodies) was performed on 3.5 \u03bcm FFPE tissue sections, using a Ventana Automated Slide Stainer (Benchmark XT, Ventana Medical Systems, AZ, USA). Heat-induced epitope retrieval was carried out using CC2 (Ventana Medical Systems). Visualization was achieved with the ultraViewTM Universal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems). Optimal dilutions and conditions were initially determined by IHC on placenta tissue (biglycan) and cerebral cortex (versican). Stromal expression was scored semi-quantitatively as low (or low to moderate) or high. Versican IHC of one DCIS case was not assessable because of tissue exhaustion; nineteen DCIS remained for evaluation.Purification of decorinHis-tagged human recombinant decorin was purified from 10x concentrated CM from HEK-293-EBNA-DCN cells. CM was adjusted to 20 mM Tris and 300 mM NaCl (pH 8.0) with stock solutions and incubated with Ni2+- NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4\u00b0C for 1h with agitation. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times (mild centrifugation at 4\u00b0C) with wash buffer (20 mM Tris and 300 mM NaCl). Supernatant was disgarded. Recombinant decorin was eluted by adding elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Supernatans was collected (mild centrifugation at 4\u00b0C) and 10x concentrated with 3K centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). The concentrate was then diluted in excess PBS and concentrated again to wash away remaining imidazole. Decorin concentration was determined by using a spectrophotometer. Samples were passed through a 0.2\u03bcm Whatman filter before storage at \u221220\u00b0 until further use.Coating assaysFor single reagent assays, 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with type I collagen or purified decorin in PBS. For combined coating assays, 96-well plates were incubated 1h with type I collagen (rat tail, SantaCruz) in PBS and washed once with PBS, before overnight incubation with purified decorin in PBS at 37\u00b0C. Wells were washed once with PBS to remove excess of unbound proteins, before seeding cancer cells onto the coatings (10.000 cells/well). After 24h of incubation at 37\u00b0 in a 5% CO2 incubator, SRB and MTT assays were performed.MTTCulture medium of 96-well plates was replaced by 100 \u03bcl culture medium containing 1mg/ml MTT. Following 2h incubation at 37\u00b0C, MTT-containing medium was removed and 150 \u03bcl of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added to dissolve formazan crystals. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a spectrophotometer (Paradigm, Molecular Devices, USA).SRBCulture medium of 96-well plates was removed and cells were fixed with 50 \u03bcl 50% trichloroacetic acid solution for 1h. Plates were washed 5 times with water. After air drying, 50 \u03bcl of 0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. After SRB removal, plates were washed 5 times with 1% acetic acid before air drying. Bound SRB was solubilized with 200 \u03bcl 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 10.5). Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a spectrophotometer (Paradigm, Molecular Devices, USA).Production of CAF-derived matricesCAF-derived matrices were generated according to an adaptation of the protocol of Castello-Cros et al. for preparation of fibroblast-derived matrices in 96-well (10.000 cells/well) and 6-well (300.000 cells/well) culture plates. Cell spreading was quantified by assessing the factor shape (i.e. inverse circularity or P2/4\u03c0A) in Adobe Photoshop CX5 software (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA, USA).Cell-electrode impedance attachment assayReal-time monitoring of cell adhesion was assessed by an electrical impedance assay with an xCELLigence RTCA SP real-time cell-sensing device (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). E-plates (ACEA Biosciences) were coated in quadruplicate with 10 \u03bcg/ml decorin, 10 \u03bcg/ml type I collagen or both (as described under coating assays). CaCo-2 and BT474 cells (10.000/ well) were seeded into coated E-plates and impedance was measured every 3 minutes for 24h. All assays were performed twice. Adhesion was expressed as the cell index, i.e. the change in electrical impedance at each time point (mean \u00b1 SD). Slopes for each curve were calculated.StatisticsStatistical analysis was performed in IBM SPSS 21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Differences in cell adhesion on coatings were assessed by one-way ANOVA for SRB and MTT assays, and by Mann-Whitney U test on calculated slopes for electrical impedance assays. Differences in IHC staining between sclerotic and myxoid DCIS were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Differences in factor shape were assessed using Mann-Whitney U test. All mentioned tests were two-sided, and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Power of IHC was calculated in SAS Power & Sample Size (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).AbbreviationsACANaggrecanACTA2alpha smooth muscle actinASPNasporinbFGFbasic fibroblast growth

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

Our data suggest that the regulation of these genes in the complex stromal-epithelial interactions that occur in human breast carcinoma, is influenced by several mechanisms.BackgroundIntegral to both normal and pathological tissue remodeling, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of proteolytic enzymes collectively degrades laminin, collagen, gelatin, and other protein components of the extracellular matrix. MMP expression allows degradation of the basement membrane, an event essential to the process of tumour metastasis. The induction of specific MMPs such as MT1-MMP and MMP-11 have been shown to correlate with tumour invasiveness and resultant metastasis in several human cancers, including breast carcinoma. Thus, gene expression analysis of these two MMPs may have clinical application in breast cancer diagnosis, management and therapy.Little is known about the mechanisms underlying MT1-MMP and MMP-11 induction. Previous studies have revealed induction of MT1-MMP in human fibroblasts grown on interstitial collagen (collagen I), which is abundant around tumours and during wound healing. Furthermore, MMP-11 has been shown to be induced by retinoic acid. This study aimed to investigate possible regulatory agents and treatments inducing MT1-MMP and/or MMP-11 expression. Specifically, MMP induction was measured in NIH3T3 and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) subjected to each of the following potentially regulatory agents: collagen I, IV and V, concanavalin-A, fibronectin, and several exogenous cytokines. As induction by such agents could be transitory, treatment times were varied from 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours, and were immediately followed by RNA extraction.As collagen I has been reported to induce MT1-MMP expression, detection of such induction by quantitative RT-PCR would provide an ideal basis for testing further regulatory agents. Collagen IV and V appeared to be ideal candidates for further analysis of MMP induction as they are present in the basement membrane and would therefore be released specifically during early tumour invasion and metastasis, which coincides with MT1-MMP and MMP-11 expression in vivo. Type IV collagen has been shown to mediate pro-MMP-2 activation in HT1080 cells, a human fibrosarcoma cell line, without inducing either a transcriptional modulation of MMP-2 or MT1-MMP expression nor any alteration of MT1-MMP protein synthesis or processing. Concanavalin-A is a plant lectin reported to stimulate activation of MMP-2. Fibronectin encourages cell adhesion and HT1080 cells cultured on fibronectin have exhibited elevated levels of MT1-MMP protein.We investigated the potential role of the following cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 in MT1-MMP and MMP-11 regulation. All of these cytokines are reportedly released by neoplastic cells and are capable of affecting transcription in fibroblasts. IL-2 is also released by tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and IL-6 is released by tumour associated macrophages (TAMs), TILs and fibroblasts. Moreover, MT1-MMP and MMP-11 have both been reported to be induced in human fibroblasts treated with conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231, a highly invasive mammary tumour cell line. Thus, we investigated the induction of MT1-MMP and MMP-11 in NIH3T3 and MEFs co-cultured with a range of HBC (human breast cancer) cell lines of varied invasive and metastatic potential. This allowed direct in situ interaction of MMPs, growth factors and other potentially regulatory agents between the fibroblasts and HBC cells.MethodsCell linesNIH3T3 culture was obtained from the ATCC, while MEF cultures were constructed at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University. Briefly, embryos were removed from 13-day pregnant mice. Following removal of the liver and head, the remaining tissue was placed in PBS (1\u00d7 pH 7.4, Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue was homogenised using an 18 guage syringe (Terumo) in PBS, plated in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar) DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium) with 10% FCS (Invitrogen) and allowed to attach for 6\u201312 hrs at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 prior to use. HBC cell lines were originally obtained from the ATCC and maintained by The Lombardi Cancer Center. ML-20 cells were derived from The Lombardi Cancer Center MCF-7 cells by clonal selection after transfection with a CMV-driven expression plasmid encoding bacterial \u03b2-galactosidase.Collagen coats and fibronectin treatmentCollagen coats and fibronectin treatments were prepared on non-coated tissue culture plates as follows: prior to seeding, triplicate sets of 2 ml 24 well plates (Costar) were overlaid with 150 \u03bcl of collagen I, IV and V (Sigma, 1 mg/ml) solutions. For the fibronectin treatments, 15 \u03bcg of fibronectin (Promega), equivalent to 5 \u03bcg/cm2 of flask area were added to each well in 2 ml 24 well plates (Costar). The wells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow the collagen coats and fibronectin to set in the wells. Excess solution was aspirated from all wells before seeding with 105 cells from either NIH3T3, or MEF cultures in 1 ml DMEM - 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Treated cultures were then incubated at two time-points, 24 hours and 48 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, before undergoing RNA extraction.Con-A treatmentNon-coated 2 ml 24 well tissue culture plates (Costar) were seeded with either NIH3T3 or MEF at 105 cells in 1 mL Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) - 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Treatments consisted of 25 \u03bcg Con-A added to the 1 ml of DMEM in each well. Treated cultures were then incubated at two time-points, 24 hours and 48 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, before undergoing RNA extraction.Cytokine treatments2 ml 24 well plates (Costar) were seeded with 105 cells from either NIH3T3 or primary mouse fibroblast cultures (passage 5) in 1 mL Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) - 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours prior to cytokine treatment, thus allowing complete attachment. All treatments were separate and consisted of final solutions of 100 units/ml IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, 0.1 units/ml of IL-8 and 1 ng/ml pan-TGF-\u03b2 (Sigma-Aldrich) in cultures grown in triplicate.Co-cultures30 mm 6 well plates (Costar) were seeded with 106 cells of either NIH3T3 or MEFs (passage 5), which were each allowed to attach overnight in 1 mL Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) - 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The DMEM was then aspirated and 24 mm Transwell Porous Cell Culture Inserts (Costar) were seeded with 105 cells of either MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-436, MCF-7s or ML-20 epithelial tumour cultures in 2 ml of RPMI medium (Trace Biosystems) - 10% fetal calf serum. Use of the porous inserts meant that co-cultures were not in direct physical contact, but shared growth media at all times. These HBC cultures exhibit different levels of invasive and metastatic potential (see Table 1). Each co-culture then underwent 48 hour incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, before RNA extraction.RNA extraction and quantificationTotal RNA was extracted from the fibroblasts using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) as previously described. Total RNA was then quantified at OD260 using a QuantaGene spectrophotometer (The Australian Chromatography Company, Sydney, NSW, Australia).Oligonucleotide primersAll 3' primers were labeled with the TET dye phosphoramidite and were commercially obtained (Applied Biosystems, Brisbane, QLD, Australia). Oligonucleotides for the target genes, MT1-MMP and MMP-11, were generated using Amplify 2.1 analysis software in conjunction with published cDNA sequences. The oligonucleotide sequences for the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA were supplied by Ambion. All sequences utilised are outlined in Table 2.Constructing cDNA competitive templatescDNA competitive templates for the target genes, MT1-MMP and MMP-11 were made by PCR amplification using purpose built 47-mer oligonucleotides as described. The 47-mers consisted of a 23 bp 5' primer complementary to target sequence either 28 bp, for MT1-MMP, or 20 bp, for MMP-11, further 5' than the remaining 24 bp of the 47-mer, which consisted of the normal 5' primer sequence for PCR. Hence, a PCR product generated from these 5' 47-mers in combination with the normal 3' primers, produced fragments shorter than when using the normal 5' primer, as these deletions were left out during sequence extension complementary to the 47-mer. Both 5' and 3' ends of the competitive template remain complementary to normal primers and therefore undergo further complementary-copying during additional PCR in a manner identical to the target sequences, except that the missing nucleotide fragments remain absent. (Table 2)Constructing mRNA competitive templatesThe cDNA competitive templates generated by PCR with the 47-mers described above were each ligated into pGem-T Easy Vectors (Promega, Annandale, NSW, Australia). JM109 (Promega) competent cells were then transformed and grown overnight. Plasmid DNA was extracted using a Magic Miniprep kit (Promega) and linearised by nuclease digest. Mimic RNA was generated from the \"mimic\" plasmids by transcription of the insert with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). The post-transcription mixture then underwent RQ1 DNase (Promega) digestion; the remaining RNA was then purified using QIAGEN RNeasy Minikit, RNA competitive template was then resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O and stored at -70\u00b0C. To ensure that amplification would not occur as a result of residual DNA contamination, control samples were run in triplicate without the reverse transcriptase thermal cycle. No amplification products were visualised on resultant agarose gels.RT-PCRSingle tube, one step RT-PCR was performed as previously described for all samples using an ABI 480 thermal cycler in 25 \u03bcl volume containing: 24 ng total RNA, 1\u20132 \u03bcl of RNA competitive template, being equivalent to 24 ng of control total RNA, 200 mM dNTPs (Promega), 5\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer [300 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 2.5 mM DTT; 250 mM KCl; 0.5% Triton X-100 (Evergreen Scientific); 30 \u03bcm EDTA; 7.5 mM MgCl2], 0.4 \u03bcM each primer, 1 unit Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer ABI), 1.2 units AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 900 ng tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim)]. Thermal cycling was as follows: 30 mins 50\u00b0C (reverse transcription), then 2 mins 95\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec 95\u00b0C, 30 sec 65\u00b0C, 45 sec 72\u00b0C, followed by a final incubation of 5 mins at 72\u00b0C.GeneScan3' primers for MT1-MMP, MMP-11 and 18S rRNA were labeled with TET fluorescent dye, thus allowing RT-PCR samples to be analysed by capillary electrophoresis using a 310 Genetic Analyzer with GeneScan software (ABI) as described previously. Using laser technology to excite the fluorescently labeled primers, samples were sized to within one base pair and the amount of amplification product of any given size, determined by fluorescence peak area.Ratio calculationsThe GeneScan values for fluorescence peak area of the target gene transcripts and the control transcripts produced the target:control ratio. All graphed values represent averages from triplicate samples and were adjusted to produce a control value of 1.00. These target:control ratio values were used to plot time series graphs of all combined data for each gene. Data on the time series graphs was then normalised to 18S rRNA expression, as measured in the same respective cultures. The 0.5\u00d7 control and 2.0\u00d7 control are the resultant target:control ratios produced using half and double the amount of total RNA used in the control sample, respectively.ResultsInduction treatmentsMT1-MMP: 3, 6, 12 and 24 hour treatmentsCompetitive quantitative RT-PCR using capillary electrophoresis and GeneScan analysis revealed no substantial changes in expression of MT1-MMP in either NIH3T3, or MEF cultures under any treatment conditions carried out over 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours (Tables 3 and 4). Although as indicated in Table 3 there are some minor initial variations, when the normalised to 18S rRNA no substantial changes are observed. The data presented are derived from GeneScan values for fluorescence peak area of the target gene transcripts and the control transcripts, thus producing the target:control ratio. All values represent averages from samples run in triplicate and have been adjusted to produce a control value of 1.00. Results for these time periods display only minor variations and generally fall between 0.5\u00d7 control and 2.0\u00d7 control expression levels.MT1-MMP: 48 hour treatmentsInductionInitial analyses of the 48 hour IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 and fibronectin treatments indicated consistently basal MT1-MMP expression levels (Table 5). Yet data for these treatments do indicate induction when normalized to the unexpectedly low level of 18S rRNA expression (Tables 7 and 8). However, 18S rRNA expression is monitored primarily to double check for substantial anomalies in mRNA quantification when positive results are found, rather than as a precise means of normalization for results which appear consistent. Furthermore, competitive RT-PCR of MT1-MMP may be considered more accurate than non-competitive differential RT-PCR of 18S rRNA. Initial competitive RT-PCR of MT1-MMP expression did produce consistently unchanged results for these treatments, while expression of 18S rRNA was found to display a relatively high level of variation in this treatment group. Specifically, the level of 18S rRNA expression exhibited in the control was high, therefore causing all other treatments to appear relatively low, which in turn caused an artificial elevation of all treatment data values during normalization. Hence, a consistent group result for competitive RT-PCR of MT1-MMP should not be discarded in favour of a single set of unusually efficient differential RT-PCRs of 18S rRNA control samples. In our opinion, MT1-MMP expression should be considered unaffected by IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 and fibronectin treatments during this time schedule.InhibitionResults indicated substantial inhibition of MT1-MMP expression by collagen I and collagen IV (Tables 5 and 6). Expression values for these treatments remained well below the 0.5\u00d7 control expression level even after normalization (Tables 7 and 8), despite this procedure raising the values in a way that may have been to some degree artificial, as described above.MMP-11: 3, 6, 12 and 24 hour treatmentsCompetitive quantitative RT-PCR using capillary electrophoresis and GeneScan analysis revealed no substantial changes in expression of MMP-11 in either fibroblast culture under any treatment conditions carried out over 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours (Tables 3, 4 and 5). Results for these time periods display only minor variations and generally fall between 0.5\u00d7 control and 2.0\u00d7 control expression levels. The use of an internal competitor to obtain increased specificity of target:template detection demonstrate data for these time periods and is highly consistent. Such consistency within groups of treatments carried out simultaneously (i.e: over an individual time schedule) further suggests that the minor variations from control expression levels which are present, may be due to amplification anomalies rather than individual differences in gene expression caused by specific treatments.MMP-11: 48 hour treatmentAt the 48 hour time point, MMP-11 expression appeared to be stimulated at least 2 fold by IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2, fibronectin and collagen V. Results indicate induction of MMP-11 by these agents independently of normalization to 18S rRNA expression (Tables 7 and 8), which further enhanced these expression values. IL-2 and IL-6 appeared to produce a very mild induction of MMP-11 without normalization to 18S rRNA, and only appeared to produce a greater than 2 fold induction when undergoing such normalization.The data suggesting that MMP-11 expression is induced by IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2, fibronectin and collagen V is highly persuasive given that these are the only data that demonstrate considerable within-group variation. The standard deviation for the 48 hour MMP-11 treatments was 47.6 while the second greatest standard deviation value was 40.5 for the 24 hour MMP-11 treatments. The average for all other MMP-11 groups was 17.3. This increase over the average variation is suggestive of differences in initial transcript levels for individual treatments. Furthermore, the fact that MT1-MMP expression levels (non-normalised) remained consistently normal for this treatment, effectively acting as an additional unregulated control, lends further credit to the likelihood of specific regulation of MMP-11 after 48 hours of treatment. There are also mild trends toward up regulation for the IL-2 and IL-6 treated samples.Co-culture with HBC cell linesInitial results demonstrate no induction or inhibition of either MT1-MMP or MMP-11 in mouse fibroblasts by co-culture with any of the HBC cell lines (Table 9). Results are highly consistent and all treatment values fall between 0.5\u00d7 control and 2.0\u00d7 control. Moreover, minor variations from control expression values observed for each co-culture are almost identical, between the two target genes. Hence, the mild expression elevations seen with ML-20 and MDA-MB-436 for both MT1-MMP and MMP-11 are in our opinion, artifactual.DiscussionThis study investigated the effects of a number of possible regulatory agents on the expression of two members of the MMP gene family for their role in human breast cancer metastases. NIH3T3 and MEF cultures were treated with cytokines, collagens, fibronectin, Con-A or matrigel, and co-cultured with various HBC cell lines. The expression of MT1-MMP and MMP-11 was then determined by competitive RT-PCR using capillary electrophoresis and GeneScan technology. Only MMP-11 expression at 48 hours was affected by treatment with IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2, fibronectin and collagen V, in the tested fibroblasts cultures.During tumour progression, the release of exogenous cytokines by neoplastic cells and immunological cells may cause a stimulatory effect on adjacent stromal fibroblasts, resulting in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) induction. Past studies indicate that some MMPs undergo regulatory changes under the influence of cytokines. Another recent study reported the induction of MMP-11 expression in primary cultured human fibroblasts over a 48 hour period by IL-6, IGF-2, EGF and PDGR-BB, but not by IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b2. Similar to the MT1-MMP results presented in the present study, MT1-MMP gene expression was reportedly not affected by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGR)-BB, IL-6, TNF-\u03b2 or IL-1\u03b2. Any influence exerted on MT1-MMP by cytokines may be of particular interest because of its specific interaction with MMP-2, an MMP with a broad substrate specificity. Hence, further analysis of candidate stimulatory agents is required to elucidate possible mechanisms by which MT1-MMP expression is stimulated.Our study did however, find evidence for an inhibitory effect from both collagen I and collagen IV on MT1-MMP expression. Curiously, there is evidence suggesting that collagen I actually stimulates MT1-MMP mRNA production in fibroblasts and activates MMP-2 in a variety of cells over a longer time period. However, past studies on rat smooth-muscle cell culture support findings that collagen IV exhibits MT1-MMP inhibitory effects.Despite reports of MDA-MB-231 conditioned media inducing MT1-MMP expression in human fibroblasts, co-culture between MEFs and MDA-MB-231, did not produce induction of either MT1-MMP or MMP-11 in this study. This finding is likely to be due to species-specificity, since mouse mammary stromal cells are not capable of supporting normal human mammary reorganization in vivo .Although the co-cultures carried out here did not allow cell-cell contact, the previous study also involved no cell-cell contact, but rather treatment with pre-conditioned media (application of isolated medium from one cell population following in vitro expansion to an another isolated cell population). Another possible explanation is that the basal level of expression of MT1-MMP and MMP-11 in cultured murine fibroblasts is elevated, thus rendering them refractory to exogenous regulatory agents. We are currently investigating this possibility.ConclusionThis study examined the effects of a number of regulatory agents and treatments on the induction of MMP-11 and MT1-MMP gene expression, factors that may influence breast cancer tumour progression. Stimulation of MMP-11 was demonstrated after treatments by both cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TGF-\u03b2) and by matrix constituents (collagen IV and fibronectin), whilst MT1-MMP was inhibited by matrix constituents (collagen I and fibronectin). The results presented suggest that several mechanisms may be involved in MMP-11 and MT1-MMP regulation as part of the complex epithelial-stromal interactions that occur within human breast carcinomas.Competing interestsNone declared.Authors contributionsS.S. performed the molecular genetic and in vitro studies, designed PCR primers and drafted the manuscript.

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

TGF-\u03b2 appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-\u03b2 pathway.IntroductionCarcinoma are complex societies of mutually interacting cells in which there is a progressive failure of normal homeostatic mechanisms, causing the parenchymal component to expand inappropriately and ultimately to disseminate to distant sites. As much as 50% or more of tumor bulk consists of non-parenchymal cells often referred to as the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells, cells of the microvasculature, and fibroblasts. Cells of the tumor parenchyma and stroma engage in extensive cross-talk, and the composition of the stroma and the nature of tumor stromal interactions change over time with tumor progression. Tumor-stroma cross-talk influences tumor growth by regulating angiogenesis, suppressing or subverting host immune responses, modulating extracellular matrix, and secreting signaling molecules which then in turn act on cells to further alter cell physiology and to change the composition of the cellular and acellular tumor microenvironment.Fibroblasts are ubiquitous stromal cells which influence other cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. The response of tumor parenchymal cells to fibroblasts depends on many factors, including the nature and extent of the oncogenic lesions in the tumor cells, and the age and activation state of the fibroblasts.While fibroblasts can have tumor suppressing activity the phenotype of the fibroblast changes to a tumor promoting state as carcinogenesis progresses. This process occurs in two stages, generating first reversibly \u201cprimed\u201d and then irreversibly modified fibroblasts with tumor-promoting properties. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) have properties distinct from normal fibroblasts and actively promote tumorigenesis in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer. Typically CAFs have an activated phenotype, expressing smooth muscle actin and showing increased motility. CAFs secrete tumor promoting effectors such as SDF-1, HGF, and TGF-\u03b2 into the tumor microenvironment, and they overproduce extracellular matrix, which contributes to tumor rigidity and an altered signaling context thus further promoting tumor progression. Thus, the phenotype of local fibroblasts can persistently be altered by complex reciprocal parenchymal-stromal interactions that occur during cancer progression.TGF-\u03b2s are pleiotropic growth factors that play important roles in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. Cells release latent TGF-\u03b2 into the microenvironment that upon activation binds to specific serine-threonine kinase receptors. A heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor and the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor (ALK5) then activates intracellular signaling cascades that include the canonical Smad2/3 signaling path and additional pathways such as TAK1-mediated p38- or JNK signaling. Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been implicated in the carcinogenic process in many organs. In the course of cancer progression, TGF-\u03b2s frequently switch from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoting role. In the embryo, expression of TGF-\u03b2 is frequently seen at sites where critical mesenchymal-epithelial interactions occur, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2s may act as an important messenger between these two compartments. In support of such a role, genetic loss of response to TGF-\u03b2 in fibroblasts is associated with aberrant expression of growth factors and cytokines by the fibroblasts and results in the development of premalignant and malignant lesions in several overlying epithelia in stomach, prostate and breast. However, forced overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 primes fibroblasts to promote the outgrowth of initiated human breast epithelial cells. These genetic approaches imply the existence of very delicately balanced TGF-\u03b2-based homeostatic interactions between fibroblasts and the epithelial parenchyma.When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to CAFs in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. Here, we have asked whether the transient interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can induce phenotypic changes in the tumor cell that then affect its malignant properties. We provide evidence that such an interaction induces the secretion and/or activation of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts, which can enhance the malignant behavior of the tumor cells in vivo.ResultsMedium Conditioned by Cocultures of Fibroblasts and Tumor Cells Induces Cell Scattering in Tumor CellsWe investigated the crosstalk between human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a hereafter referred to as CA1a) and fibroblasts (DF) in a two-dimensional coculture system. Cocultures of CA1a and DF formed an organized structure of tumor cell islets that were surrounded by elongated fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Using CA1a cells and DF that were stably infected to report activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of fluorescent protein, we found that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated in both tumor and stromal cells in the cocultures, as compared to much lower levels of activation in the homotypic cultures (Fig. 1A). This observation suggested that cocultures might exhibit emergent properties that were not present in the homotypic cultures. To address the effect of coculturing on secreted components of the tumor microenvironment, we used conditioned media from 4 d old homotypic cultures or cocultures to stimulate CA1a cells that had not been previously exposed to any conditioned media. In scratch assays medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) significantly accelerated closure of the cell-cleared area as compared to medium conditioned by tumor cells (TuCM), fibroblasts alone (FbCM), or unconditioned control medium (medium) (Fig. 1B,C). A similar result was seen when we treated tumor cells that had been plated as a tight colony and assessed migration of cells out of the colony (dot assay). This assay format more closely mimics the migration of tumor cells out of a tumor into the surrounding environment, and eliminates the wounding aspect of the scratch assay. In dot assays CoCM caused scattering of tumor cells from the edges of the colony, whereas colonies treated with homotypic media retained a defined closed edge (Fig. 1B). While CoCM increased migration of CA1a cells, proliferation of CA1a cells was unaffected by treatment with CM (Fig. S1A). At the cellular level, CoCM caused translocation of E-cadherin to the cytoplasm of CA1a cells whereas E-cadherin remained localized at the cell membrane of CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 1B, D). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts causes secretion of a soluble factor that increases cell scattering and migration of tumor cells.Cocultures of breast cancer cells are well organized and increase motility of tumor cells.\nA.\nUpper panel. Human breast cancer cells (CA1a) and mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) form a well organized 2D coculture where fibroblast streaks surround tumor cell islets. Middle panel. Use of fibroblasts and CA1a cells that report Smad3 dependent TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of RFP and GFP, respectively, demonstrates that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell types is increased in cocultures as compared to the homotypic cultures. Bottom Panel. Outline of the tumor cell and fibroblast compartments of the images shown in the middle panel. B. Medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) as compared to medium from homotypic fibroblast (FbCM) and tumor cell (TuCM) cultures increases cell migration and cell scattering in scratch assays (24 h) and dot assays (4 d), and induces cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin as visualized by confocal microscopy (60 min). C. Influence of CoCM on closure of in vitro wounds (\u201cscratch assay\u201d). Cells were plated to confluence, mitosis inhibited by preincubation with mitomycin, and cells then stimulated with conditioned media. CoCM causes significantly faster closure of scratches as compared to all other conditioned media (scratch width after 24 h, n\u200a=\u200a8 samples/group, ANOVA/Bonferroni; p<0.0001). D. Quantification of E-cadherin related immunofluorescence in CA1a cells treated with CM (Fig. 1B). Membranes and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of membrane and cytoplasmic signal were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p\u200a=\u200a0.0052).Cell Scattering Induced by Coculture Conditioned Medium Depends on Active TGF-\u03b2 Synthesized by FibroblastsCell scattering can be induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, and so we tested the effect of candidate factors in the dot assay. Only TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml, Fig. 2A) but not other growth factors such as EGF (Fig. 2A, 25 ng/ml to 250 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml), HGF (5 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml), latency associated protein (LAP, 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) or activin A (0.1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml), induced scattering of CA1a cells in dot assays. To address whether endogenous TGF-\u03b2 might be the factor in CoCM that induces scattering, we used two different Smad-reporter systems to analyze if CA1a cells respond to TGF-\u03b2 in the CM and to sensitively report on the presence of active TGF-\u03b2 in the conditioned media. CoCM induced higher Smad3- and Smad2-mediated luciferase activity than did TuCM, FbCM, or medium, demonstrating that CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2 increases TGF-\u03b2 signaling in tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, CoCM contained higher levels of active TGF-\u03b2 (194\u00b139 pg/ml) than the other conditioned media (TuCM: 94\u00b16 pg/ml, FbCM: 106\u00b122 pg/ml, medium: 0 pg/ml, Fig. 2C) as assessed by activation of a PAI-luciferase reporter activity in CCL64 cells.TGF-\u03b2 signaling induces scattering of CA1a cells.\nA. Exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and fibroblast-released TGF-\u03b2 induces cell scattering in dot assays. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated over night, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), or vehicle (Control) for 4 d. Use of CoCM that was derived from cocultures of CA1a cells and TGF\u03b21 knockout fibroblasts (CoCM(KO)) did not stimulate cell scattering while conditioned medium from cocultures employing TGF-\u03b21 wildtype fibroblasts (CoCM(WT)) did induce cell scattering. B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces higher levels of CAGA (Smad3) and ARE (Smad2) mediated luciferase activity in CA1a cells (n\u200a=\u200a3, ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison, p\u200a=\u200a0.0002 (ARE) and p<0.0001 (CAGA)). C. CoCM contains higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 than TuCM and FbCM. CCL-64 cells were stimulated with CM overnight and PAI-driven luciferase activity was measured. D. Scattering of CA1a cells is induced by addition of 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 to medium. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated overnight, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (0.2 ng/ml) or vehicle for 4 d.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 can induce scattering of CA1a cells in concentrations similar to those secreted by cocultures into the CoCM. To do this we stimulated CA1a with medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 and observed that that this low level of TGF-\u03b2 was sufficient to induce tumor cell scattering (Fig. 2D). Likewise, Smad3 driven GFP expression of the CAGA\u223cGFP reporter was increased by stimulation of CA1a cells with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. S2A). These results indicate that the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 that is secreted by cocultures into the culture medium (CoCM) is sufficient to stimulate cell scattering of CA1a cells.To ask whether this effect was limited to CA1a cells or was more universal we stimulated MCF-7 cells and T47D cells which form adherent cell colonies in culture with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 or CoCM. Both, 0.2 ng/ml exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and CoCM, were capable of inducing scattering of MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. S3), indicating that low concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 as found in CoCM can increase motility of several breast cancer cell lines.Since tumor cells as well as fibroblasts can secrete TGF-\u03b2, we went on to identify the source of TGF-\u03b2 in our coculture system. While medium obtained from cocultures of CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice stimulated scattering of CA1a cells, coculture medium from CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from TGF-\u03b21-null mice did not induce scattering of CA1a cells (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts induces production or activation of TGF-\u03b21 by fibroblasts that then stimulates scattering of the tumor cells.CoCM Stimulates Canonical and Noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 Signaling in CA1a CellsThe TGF-\u03b2 signaling network includes canonical signaling via Smad2/3 as well as non-canonical signaling cascades. Non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling via MAPK pathways can be mediated by TAK1 that then activates JNK- and p38-signaling (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis showed that Smad2, Smad3 and TAK1 were phosphorylated to a greater extent by stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM than by stimulation with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 3A), indicating activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM. On a cellular level, CoCM induced nuclear translocation of Smad2/3in CA1a cells as demonstrated by immunostaining (Fig. 3B,C). This and the induction of Smad2 and Smad3 dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B) further demonstrate that CoCM activates canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells. Similarly, immunofluorescence showed significantly increased levels of proteins of the p38 signaling cascade (phospho-p38, phospho-ATF-2, and phospho-MAPKAPK2) and of phospho-JNK in CA1a cells stimulated with CoCM as compared to CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 4A,B). These data demonstrate that canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are activated upon stimulation of CA1a with CoCM.CoCM activates Smad2/3-signaling and the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK in CA1a cells suggesting activation of canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2.\nA. TGF-\u03b2 activates canonical signaling via Smad2/3 and non-canonical signaling via TAK-1 relayed JNK- and p38 signaling cascades. CoCM stimulated both, phosphorylation of TAK1, and phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3. Cells were incubated with CoCM for 30 min (pTAK1) or 60 min (pSmad2, pSmad3). B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces nuclear localization of Smad2/3 within 60 min, indicating activation of canonical Smad signaling upon stimulation with CoCM. C. Quantification of Smad2/3 mediated immunofluorescence in CM treated CA1a cells (Fig. 2B). Nuclei and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001, n\u200a=\u200anumber of cells analyzed).CoCM activates the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK signaling in CA1a.\nA. Stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM as compared to FbCM and TuCM for 60 min increases levels of phospho-p38 (pp38), pATF-2, pMAPKAPK-2, and pJNK as visualized by fluorescence microscopy, indicating that CoCM activates these non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades. For quantification of pp38-, pATF-2-, pMAPKAPK2- and pJNK mediated immunofluorescence cells were gated and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001 [pp38], p<0.0001 [pATF-2], p<0.0001 [pMAPKAPK2], p<0.00001 [pJNK]). 30 to 40 cells were analyzed per group. B. Inhibitors were added to cultures 30 min prior to stimulating CA1a cells with CoCM for 60 min. E-cadherin was visualized by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. For quantification of E-cadherin mediated the cell membrane and the cytoplasm were gated for each cell and average signal intensities were determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnetts's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001. n \u200a=\u200a number of cells analyzed in each group.Likewise, medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 induced increased levels of pSmad2, pTAK1, MKK3/6, pJNK, pp38, pATF-2, and pMAPKAPK2 in Western blotting (Fig. S2B), indicating that the TGF-\u03b2 concentration that is found in CoCM (0.2 ng/ml) can not only stimulate cell scattering (Fig. 2D), but also is sufficient to activate canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades in CA1a cells.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling is necessary for CoCM induced cell scattering and blocked ALK5, JNK, and p38 signaling during stimulation of CA1a with CoCM. The ALK5 inhibitor SB431542, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4B) all abolished tumor cell scattering induced by CoCM. On a cellular level, those same inhibitors reduced cytoplasmic translocation of E-cadherin induced by CoCM (Fig. 4B), again indicating that both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are involved in CoCM induced cell scattering. Hence, CoCM stimulates tumor cell scattering via activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling.CoCM Causes Increased Tumor Growth and Metastasis In Vivo Cell migration and cell scattering are in vitro correlates of increased tumor cell malignancy. Thus, we next asked if the transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM alters in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of CA1a cells. First we treated CA1a cells with CoCM for 4 d in vitro, and then we washed, trypsinized, and injected cells into the mammary fat pads of SCID mice (Fig. 5A). The ex vivo pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM significantly accelerated primary tumor growth at the orthotopic site when compared to CA1a cells treated with TuCM, FbCM or medium alone (Fig. 5B).CoCM increases tumorigenicity and expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells.\nA. Experimental design of orthotopic implantation- and tail vein injection models. CA1a cells were pre-treated ex vitro with CM for 4 days, trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in DPBS. Orthotopic Implantation Model. 4\u00d7104 cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor size was assessed thrice weekly using calipers. Estimated tumor volumes were calculated by the formula (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail Vein Injection Model. 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS were injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice, and animals were monitored twice weekly for signs of metastasis. B.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM accelerates growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors in vivo. The axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice were bilaterally inoculated with CA1a cells that were pre-treated with CM (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor volumes at day 23 were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Kruskal Wallis test/Dunn's multiple comparison; p<0.001; CoCM vs TuCM: ***, CoCM vs FbCM: **, CoCM vs medium: ***, TuCM vs FbCM: N.S., TuCM vs medium: N.S., FbCM vs medium: N.S.. Representative of 2 independent experiments. C.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM results in extrapulmonary metastases in tail vein injection assays. CA1a cells were incubated with conditioned media for 4 days and injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice. While all animals developed lung metastases, only animals injected with CoCM treated CA1a cells developed extrapulmonary tumors. Extrapulmonary tumor growth was suppressed when TGF-\u03b2 signaling was inhibited by the ALK 5 inhibitor SB431542 during exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM. Animals receiving CoCM pre-treated cells had significantly higher occurrence of extrapulmonary tumors than all other groups (Chi Square Test, tail vein injection #1: p\u200a=\u200a0.0002; tail vein injection #2: p\u200a=\u200a0.0085). D. Functional TGF-\u03b2 signaling of tumor cells is required for CoCM induced formation of extrapulmonary metastases. Blocking of ALK5 mediated TGF-\u03b2 signaling by the ALK5-inhibitor SB435142 during in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM inhibited metastases and significantly increased survival time of animals in vivo (median survival: CoCM: 62 days (n\u200a=\u200a13 animals), SB431542: 96 days (n\u200a=\u200a14 animals), Kaplan Maier Analysis, p<0.0001).The metastatic potential of CoCM treated cells was explored by injection into the tail vein of NOD SCID mice because the CA1a cell line does not metastasize efficiently from the orthotopic site. Additionally this assay format allows metastatic efficiency to be assessed independently of any effect of the experimental intervention on tumor development at the primary site. Mice in all experimental groups developed metastatic colonies of CA1a cells in the lung (Fig. 5C) and no differences of the number of lung colonies were found between the CoCM- and other treatment groups at day 40 after injections of tumor cells (Fig. S4); however, we observed a fairly high frequency of tumor colonization at extrapulmonary sites exclusively in animals that were injected with tumor cells that had been pre-treated with CoCM (Fig. 5C). Extrapulmonary tumors were seen at subcutaneous sites in the proximity of axillary and inguinal mammary fat pads, and in the thoracic wall. Histologically, subcutaneous metastatic tumors resembled the xenografted primary tumors (Fig. 6A, B).CoCM expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells and induces sustained TGF-\u03b2 signaling via pSmad2.\nA. Extrapulmonary tumors formed by CoCM pre-treated CA1a cells after tail vein injection were highly invasive. Extrapulmonary tumors were observed in the subcutaneously, often in the proximity to mammary fat pads (arrows indicate a normal mammary duct, hematoxylin-eosin staining). B. Xenograft tumors and extrapulmonary metastatic tumors derived from CoCM pre-treated cells have higher levels of nuclear pSmad2 than xenograft tumors derived from medium pre-treated CA1a cells as shown by immunostaining. Levels of pSmad2 in xenograft and metastatic tumors were higher in CA1a cells invading the surrounding tissue (arrows) as compared to tumor cells in the center of tumors. The negative control was obtained by omitting the primary antibody. C. Nuclear pSmad2 is increased in tumor cells at the tumor stroma border (arrows) as compared to cells in the center of tumors that spontaneously developed in a C3(1)TAg model of breast cancer and in an orthotopic syngeneic model of breast cancer (4T1 cells/BALB/c mice).We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 was the component of the CoCM that was responsible for the expanded metastatic range of CA1a cells treated with CoCM. To do this we included the ALK5 kinase inhibitor SB431542 during the 4 day pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM. After washing away the SB431542 together with the CoCM, the CA1a cells were injected into NOD SCID mice using the same experimental design as before. Ex vivo incubation of CA1a cells with CoCM and SB431542 as compared to CoCM, resulted in significantly increased survival rates in tail vein metastasis assays (Fig. 5D). Again, we observed that animals injected with CoCM treated cells or with CoCM + SB435142 treated cells equally developed lung metastases (Fig. 5C), and when re-plated in regular culture medium, proliferation of CA1a cells pre-treated with CoCM was equal to proliferation of CA1a cells pretreated with CoCM +SB431542, indicating that SB431542 did not negatively influence proliferation or survival of pre-treated cells (data not shown). However, only 1/14 animal injected with CoCM + SB431542 developed an extrapulmonary tumor, while 5/15 animals that were injected with CoCM treated tumors developed extrapulmonary tumors in tail vein assays (Fig. 5C). Thus, a transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM and consequent activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in these cells not only durably increases tumorigenicity but also permits successful colonization of a wider range of target tissues.Active TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Sustained in Tumors Originating from CoCM Treated CellsWe next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells is durably increased in vivo after stimulation of CA1a cells with TGF-\u03b2 containing CoCM in vitro. Nuclear pSmad2 levels were higher in xenograft tumors or metastatic tumors originating from CoCM treated cells than in xenograft tumors originating from medium treated cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells by treatment with CoCM is sustained in vivo, indicating that the transient exposure of CA1a cells to elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels causes a durable change in TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity.TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Increased at the Tumor - Stroma Border of Tumors in Several Mouse ModelsNext, we investigated whether TGF-\u03b2 signaling is increased when tumor cells invade the fibroblast-containing stroma surrounding a primary tumor as would be predicted from our observations. Immunostaining of pSmad2 in sections of mammary tumors derived from different mouse breast cancer models (CA1a xenograft tumors, syngeneic mouse mammary tumor (4T1), and tumors from the C3(1)TAg transgenic model) revealed that pSmad2 levels are higher in cells at the tumor stroma border, and particularly in those cells invading the surrounding stroma, as compared to tumor cells in the center of the tumor (Fig. 6C). Thus, activation of pSmad2 naturally occurs when tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma.Taken together, our results imply that tumor cells, once they traverse through the surrounding stroma, can subvert normal fibroblasts to increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in the microenvironment that then induces tumor cell migration, cell scattering, and an expanded metastatic pattern, thereby boosting the malignancy of tumor cells (Fig. 7).Tumor-stroma interactions increase malignancy of tumor cells by bidirectional effects of TGF-\u03b2.Direct interactions of tumor cells and fibroblasts as they occur when parenchymal tumor cells invade the underlying stroma increase secretion of TGF-\u03b2 by tumor cells as well as by fibroblasts. TGF-\u03b2 has bidirectional effects on both cells types. Fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2 can directly stimulate tumor cell migration and malignancy. Tumor cell derived TGF-\u03b2 induces fibroblasts to secrete MMP-9. Increased MMP-9 levels then might further increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2, and also facilitate matrix degradation and migration of tumor cells, further increasing the malignant potential of tumor cells.DiscussionInteractions between tumor cells and the fibroblasts of the tumor microenvironment are complex, reciprocal and stage-dependent. Here we have shown that transient interactions of breast carcinoma cells with normal fibroblasts in vitro can increase tumor cell malignancy and expand the metastatic range of tumor cells in vivo by a TGF-\u03b2 dependent mechanism. Specifically, the interaction of human breast carcinoma cells with normal murine fibroblasts induces aberrant secretion of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. This transient exposure of tumor cells to fibroblast-derived TGF-\u03b2 then durably increases tumorigenesis even when the two cell types are no longer interacting. Thus, tumor cells traversing through connective tissue may exploit their transient interaction with normal fibroblasts so as to get a boost in the metastatic process (Fig. 7). This phenomenon has a number of interesting features that are discussed below.Emergent Properties and Reciprocity in the Co-CulturesThe interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can generate emergent system properties that are not seen when the cells are cultured separately. Our experimental design allowed us to focus specifically on the impact of this interaction on the tumor cells, and to start to identify soluble mediators. We showed that co-culture of the two cell types significantly increased the levels of fibroblast derived active TGF-\u03b2 in the extracellular environment, and that this TGF-\u03b2 subsequently enhanced migration of the tumor cells in vitro and malignant behavior in vivo. It has been previously proposed that tumor cells can induce a reversibly \u201cprimed state\u201d in normal fibroblasts, in which the fibroblasts can promote tumorigenesis even though they do not have all the characteristics of the irreversibly modified CAFs. Our data suggest that such priming may involve cancer cell-induced production of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. It is likely that TGF-\u03b2 produced by these primed fibroblasts contributes to the elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels that are seen in the vicinity of many advanced human tumors.Co-cultures of fibroblasts and tumor cells showed increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell compartments, consistent with the presence of activated TGF-\u03b2 in the CoCM (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the tumor cell compartment in this co-culture model can induce MMP-9 secretion by fibroblasts in a Smad-, ras- and PI3K dependent fashion. In the present work, we demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the fibroblast compartment enhanced the migration of tumor cells through the activation of Smad-, p38- and JNK-signaling cascades. Together the data suggest that TGF-\u03b2-mediated signaling between the tumor cells and fibroblasts is bidirectional, involves a distinct combination of signaling cascades in each partner, and has different molecular outcomes in each compartment. It is currently not clear how the two cell types can selectively respond to the TGF-\u03b2 produced by the other, but this phenomenon conceivably might reflect differences in TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, and/or structure of the latent complexes made by each cell type, as well as cell specific regulation of signal flux through the TGF-\u03b2 network within each cell type. However, since MMP-9 can create a microenvironment more favorable to invasion and metastasis through activation of growth factors, specifically TGF-\u03b2, and destruction of extracellular matrix, the combined biological outcome of the differing effects of TGF-\u03b2 on each compartment is likely to be a further enhancement of malignant behavior (Fig. 7).Transient Tumor-Fibroblast Interactions Generate Small Magnitude Molecular Effects That Induce Major Changes in OutcomeExposure of rat mammary tumor cells to exogenous TGF-\u03b2 ex vivo has previously been shown to promote metastatic efficiency in vivo . Here we have shown that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts, such as might occur when tumor cells traverse the surrounding tissue, can have a similar effect. The amount of active TGF-\u03b2 that was produced by the coculture was very low, and the activation of downstream signaling pathways was similarly mild (Figs 2 to   5). Nevertheless, these small magnitude, endogenous molecular effects altered the phenotype of the tumor cell such that it showed significantly increased malignant behavior even when no longer in contact with the fibroblast compartment. The data imply that carcinoma cells that have breached the basement membrane and are migrating through underlying connective tissue may be able to subvert and use resident, TGF-\u03b2 secreting fibroblasts to boost their motility and subsequent metastatic spread.Underlying MechanismsTGF-\u03b2 has a number of tumor cell-targeted effects that could contribute to the enhanced malignancy, including enhancement of tumor cell migration and invasion, direct effects on tumor cell survival, and changes in the composition of secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix components. The stimulatory effect of CoCM on primary tumor growth may reflect pro-survival effects of TGF-\u03b2 on CA1a cells as TGF-\u03b2 reduces apoptosis of CA1a cells (Fig. S1B), possibly acting in concert with other as yet unidentified trophic factors in the CM.The ability of TGF-\u03b2 to promote migration and invasion of CA1a cells may contribute to the enhanced metastasis, but additional mechanisms such as altered expression levels of junctional proteins like E-cadherin, integrins, or chemokines and chemokine receptors are also likely to play a role. For example, the organ tropism of metastatic tumors is determined in part by the spectrum of chemokines and chemokine receptors that they express, and TGF-\u03b2s have been shown to modulate relevant chemokine ligand/receptor axes in other models. TGF-\u03b2 derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts upregulates CXCR4 in initiated prostatic epithelial cells, and expression of CXCR4 correlates with lymph node metastasis in multiple human tumors. It will be the aim of future work to determine which mechanism is relevant for the expanded metastatic range shown by the CA1a breast cancer cells stimulated with fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2.Consequences and ConclusionsIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that a relatively short-lived interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts induces changes in the localized extracellular microenvironment that then substantially increase the malignancy of the tumor cells even after the original interaction has ceased. The data imply that normal resident fibroblasts that are exposed to direct contact with invading tumor cells may boost the motility and subsequent metastatic spread of these carcinoma cells. TGF-\u03b2 appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-\u03b2 pathway.Materials and MethodsCell Culture and Generation of Conditioned MediaMCF10CA1a (\u201cCA1a\u201d) is a malignant, metastatic human breast cancer line. Mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) were derived from newborn mice as previously described. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from embryos (ED 12 to ED 14) by suspending embryonic tissue in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (\u201cfibroblast medium\u201d). CA1a and DF were respectively grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (\u201cCA1a medium\u201d) and DMEM, low glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen or Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). To obtain conditioned media from homotypic cultures or cocultures, 1.5\u00d7106 cells of each type were plated in a 150 cm2 dish and incubated in a 1\u22361 mixture of CA1a- and fibroblast medium (\u201ccoculture medium\u201d). Culture supernatants were collected after 4 d and cells were removed by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min). Acellular supernatants were diluted with fresh coculture medium (conditioned medium, CM) and used for further experiments.Cell Scattering and MigrationDot AssayTo assess cell scattering, 20 \u00b5l of cell suspension (3\u00d7106 CA1a cells/ml) were placed in each well of 6-well plates and allowed to adhere to form tight well-circumscribed colonies. After 3 hours non-attached cells were removed by rinsing the plate with calcium-containing Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were incubated in regular culture medium overnight, and then switched for 4 days to a 1\u22361 mixture of CM and fresh coculture medium. Cell scattering was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically following staining with hematoxylin-eosin. Unconditioned medium served as an additional negative control. The effect of growth factors and cytokines on cell scattering was assessed by adding the following growth factors in concentrations as indicated to the culture medium for 4 days: human TGF-\u03b21, human EGF, LAP (all R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), human TNF-\u03b1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and HGF (kind gift from Don Bottaro). Where indicated, small molecule inhibitors of various signaling pathways (ALK4,5,7: SB431542, 5 \u00b5M, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; MEK/Erk: PD98059, 25 \u00b5M; p38: SB203580, 10 \u00b5M; JNK: SP600125, 10 \u00b5M (all Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)) were added to cultures 30 min before stimulation with the conditioned medium. Equal amounts of DMSO served as a negative control.Scratch AssayCA1a cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to confluence. Cell proliferation was blocked by a 30 min pretreatment with mitomycin C (25 \u00b5g/ml). A scratch was then made in each well using a 100 \u00b5l pipette tip and cells were stimulated with the various CM in 1\u22361 mixtures with fresh coculture medium. The scratch width at different time points was imaged and measured using ImagePro. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 2.0.Immunostaining and Western BlottingImmunofluorescence and Western Blotting were performed following established protocols. The following antibodies were used: Immunofluorescence: phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, phospho-ATF2, phospho-MAPKAPK2 (all 1\u2236100, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and E-cadherin (1\u2236800, Zymed, Carlsbad, CA). Western Blotting: Smad3 (1\u22361000, Zymed), Smad2/3 (1\u22361000, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), phospho-Smad3 (1\u223612 000, Gift from E. Leoff), phospho-Smad2, phospho-TAK, TAK (both 1\u22361000, Cell Signaling), and actin (1\u223660 000, BD Biosciences) for Western Blotting. Immunoperoxidase staining for phospho-Smad2 (1\u2236500, Millipore, Temecula,CA) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections.Transfection, Reporter Assays, and Lentiviral InfectionTransfection of CA1a cells with the CAGA12-luciferase plasmid or with the reporter plasmids ARE-luciferase/FAST-1, and lentiviral infections were performed as described previously.Quantification of TGF-\u03b2Levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in CM were determined using PAI-driven luciferase expression in CCL-64 cells. Briefly, CCL-64 cells that were stably transfected with PAI-luc were cultured in 48-well plates (20000 cells/well) in 200 \u00b5l RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS for 36 hours and serum starved (RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS) for 8 hours. Then 100 \u00b5l medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul CM (sample) or 100 \u00b5l unconditioned medium spiked with varying concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 to establish a standard curve. Cells were incubated over night, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vivo TumorigenesisFemale SCID and NOD SCID animals (age: 8\u201310 weeks) were purchased from the NCI Animal Production Program. For tumorigenesis studies, 4\u00d7104 tumor cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the # II and # VII mammary fat pads of female SCID mice. Tumor size was assessed using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula for an oblique spheroid (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively.

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above.

        "content": "Integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) overexpression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression. However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

        "content": "Ductal infiltrating carcinoma (d.i.c.) of human breast is a highly invasive neoplasm characterized by enhanced deposition of collagen. Paradoxically, enhanced collagen deposition is not correlated with inhibition of the migration of tumour cells into the host tissue. d.i.c. is characterized by the reappearance of 'embryonic' type I-trimer collagen and an increase in type V collagen content in the matrix. The effects of these two collagen types were compared with type I collagen as culture substrata on the spreading pattern, cytoskeletal organization and motile behaviour of 8701-BC breast carcinoma cells using rhodamine-phalloidin staining, a DNAase I-competition assay, scanning electron microscopy and time-lapse video-microscopy. Cells grown on type I collagen were stationary, showing a well-spread morphology and an extensive stress fibre pattern. Cells grown on type V collagen were also stationary, but displayed a poorly spread and elongated morphology. In contrast, cells grown on trimer collagen were motile and displayed a compact morphology and a reduced content of stress fibres. Both single-cell and group motility were detectable on trimer collagen substratum. These data are consistent with the existence of two opposite local signals, type I-trimer and type V collagens, which may confer a more or a less metastatic phenotype on breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, the synthesis of trimer collagen in d.i.c. is conceivably instrumental in providing new stromal pathways permitting tumour cells to infiltrate the host tissue.",

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The relative mRNA levels obtained by qRT-PCR were used to calculate the normalized log2 ratios. The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against CTGF (1:1000, ab209780), \u03b1-SMA (1:5000, ab124964), FAP (1:1000, ab207178) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, TA-10), and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, ZB-2301) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, ZB-2305) antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate was used to visualize the blots with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit. The total protein concentration was also examined, and then the concentrations of secreted protein of different samples were normalized to corresponding total protein.Lentiviral TransductionThe pLV-EF1\u03b1-CTGF-CMV-Puro lentiviral plasmid (CTGF-OE), negative control lentiviral plasmid (NC), CTGF-specific shRNAs (sh-CTGF), negative control shRNAs and the according lentivirus were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Co. (Shanghai, China). Viral titres of approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 infectious units/ml were obtained. Lentivirus infection was performed with polybrene according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs.

The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h.

Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates Fibroblast Expression of CTGF and Inhibits the Ability of Breast Cancer Cells to Transform Fibroblasts Into CAF-Like CellsBecause CTGF is associated with the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, we examined the effect of ATL-1 on CTGF expression in fibroblasts. We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation. (-) in (E) represent without ATL-1 and rCTGF treatment. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates.

All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.Atractylenolide-I Sensitizes Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Paclitaxel in a Mouse ModelFinally, we analyzed the effect of ATL-1 on chemosensitivity in vivo. We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6).

Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

The results suggest that the fibrosis and environmental cytokines contribute to the collective invasion of cancers in vivo. INTRODUCTIONTumor invasion is one of the most critical steps in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism of cancer cell invasion into the connective tissues has not sufficiently been elucidated. For understanding this mechanism, it is essential to clarify the interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironmental factors. 1 ,  2  In addition, simple and physiologically relevant experimental models are required for these studies. Fibroblasts are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment. There are many lines of evidence that fibroblasts around cancer cells, called cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote tumor invasion and progression by complex interaction with cancer cells. 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6  Cytokines such as transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), regulate the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, and proliferation of cancer cells, depending on cancer cell types. 5 ,  7 ,  8  Extracellular matrix\u2010degrading enzymes such as MMPs and serine proteinases are also required for cancer cell invasion. 4 ,  5 ,  9  Extracellular matrices such as fibronectin (FN) 10 ,  11 ,  12  and laminins 13 ,  14 ,  15  play fundamental roles in supporting adhesion, survival, and migration of cancer cells. Fibronectin is the major ECM component produced by normal fibroblasts and CAFs. 10 ,  11  There is accumulating evidence that FN is involved in tumor progression, and its tumor\u2010suppressive functions have also been reported. 11 ,  12  Recent in vitro studies have shown that the FN matrix supports cancer cell invasion. 16 ,  17 ,  18  However, some other studies suggest that CAFs support cancer cell invasion by direct interaction with cancer cells. 19 ,  20 ,  21  One of the studies indicated that fibroblasts lead collective cell invasion of epidermoid carcinoma cells in collagen matrix. 21  In this model, fibroblasts tow cancer cells into the collagen matrix by direct cell adhesion through E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin heterophilic interaction.Recently we established a simple 3\u2010D collagen gel culture model to investigate the cancer invasion mechanism. Using this system, we proposed a novel tumor invasion mechanism in which cancer cells invade the collagen matrix while binding to fibroblasts through integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction. 22  In this mechanism, invasive cancer cells, such as lung carcinoma A549 and pancreatic carcinoma Panc\u20101 cells, individually migrate on single elongated protrusions of CAFs on which FN fibrils are densely assembled. However, it seems physically difficult for a cluster of cancer cells to migrate on a single fibroblast fiber. Pathological studies of cancer tissues showed that the migration of cancer cells in clusters, ie collective cancer invasion, occurs more often than the single cell invasion. 23 ,  24 ,  25  In the former cases, cancer cells collectively invade stromal tissues keeping tight intercellular junctions, mostly the E\u2010cadherin\u2010mediated junction. 25  In this study, therefore, we investigated whether our previously proposed mechanism is applicable to collective cancer invasion. We also examined the effects of some cytokines on cancer cell invasion in our model.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsFunction\u2010blocking mouse mAbs against FN (FN12\u20108) and E\u2010cadherin (SHE78\u20107) were purchased from Takara. Other Abs used were described previously. 22  Cytokines and signaling inhibitors were purchased as follows: EGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, SB431542 (TGF\u2010\u03b2 type I receptor/ALK5 inhibitor), Y27632 (Rock inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), and U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) were from Fuji Film/Wako, and TAPI\u20101 (metalloproteinase inhibitor) was from Funakoshi. The RGD peptide (Gly\u2010Arg\u2010Gly\u2010Asp\u2010Ser\u2010Pro) was purchased from Takara and bovine dermis native collagen from Koken.Human cell lines, colorectal cancer tissues, and culture conditionDLD\u20101 (colon adenocarcinoma) and MCF\u20107 (mammary adenocarcinoma) cells were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research and Bioresources. Green fluorescent protein\u2010labeled Panc\u20101 (pancreas adenocarcinoma), GFP\u2010labeled A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), and WI\u201038 (fetal lung fibroblast) cell lines were used in our previous study. 22  DLD\u20101 cells were labeled with GFP by introducing the pTagGFP2\u2010N vector (Evrogen) with the Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen), and the GFP\u2010expressing cells were selected with Geneticin (Gibco). MCF\u20107 cells were transiently labeled with green fluorescence using Cell Explore Live Cell Tracking Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (AAT Bioquest). Primary cultures of human lung cancer\u2010derived fibroblasts were established in Juntendo University Hospital. The Institutional Review Board at the Juntendo University School of Medicine approved the procedures. The patient provided written, informed consent (No. 20\u00a0042). Experimental procedures were carried out according to the institutional guidelines and those of the 1995 Declaration of Helsinki. In this study, one of the fibroblast lines was used as a CAF. In some experiments, CAFs were transiently labeled with red fluorescence using the same kit as above. All these cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Human cancer specimens were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Kanagawa Cancer Center (KCC) Hospital (Kanagawa, Japan) between 2006 and 2009 and provided by Human Cancer Tissue Bank of KCC. 22  The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committees of KCC, and carried out as described previously. 22  Cancer cell invasion assay in 3\u2010D collagen gelCollagen gel invasion assay was undertaken as previously reported. 22  Briefly, hybrid spheroids of cancer cells and CAFs were prepared by incubating their mixture (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well each) overnight on an EZSPHERE 96\u2010well plate (AGC Techno Glass), which effectively prepares homogeneous microspheroids. 26  The resulting spheroids in each well were collected into a 1.5\u2010mL tube and suspended in 100\u00a0\u00b5L ice\u2010cold collagen/medium solution. Each spheroid contained approximately 170 cells on average for each cell type. For the 3\u2010D gel cultures, two layers of collagen gel, ie 70\u00a0\u00b5L lower gel and 50\u00a0\u00b5L upper spheroid\u2010containing gel, were prepared on the 12\u2010mm glass bottom of 35\u2010mm culture dishes (AGC) and incubated in the standard medium for 2\u201014\u00a0days. Phase\u2010contrast images with GFP fluorescence signals were obtained using an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope. For time\u2010lapse experiments, phase\u2010contrast images with fluorescent signals were obtained using a Keyence BZ\u20109000 digital fluorescence microscope equipped with a CO2 incubator at 60\u2010minute intervals for one representative spheroid.Inhibition assays of 3\u2010D cancer cell invasionTo assay inhibitory activity of Abs, 10\u00a0\u00b5g/mL normal mouse IgG as control, 1.3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL anti\u2010FN mouse mAb (FN12\u20108), 1.3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin SHE78\u20107 mouse mAb, or antiintegrin Abs at a 100\u2010fold dilution were included in both spheroid\u2010containing gel and culture medium. To see the effects of small molecules and cytokines, the factors were added only into culture medium. The RGD peptide was used at 0.3\u00a0mmol/L. Fluorescent images were obtained after 2\u00a0days of incubation. Relative activity of DLD\u20101 cell invasion was quantitated by NIH ImageJ software. One broader area enclosing invaded and noninvaded cells and a spheroid core area were separately set in each fluorescent image of 12\u201015 representative spheroids obtained from triplicate dishes. The tumor cell invasion was determined by subtracting the fluorescent intensity of the spheroid core from that of the broader area.Cell adhesion assays in 2\u2010D culturesAdhesion activity was assayed on 24\u2010well culture plates. Fluorescence\u2010labeled cancer cells were seeded at 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well on a previously prepared confluent CAF layer. To assay inhibitory activity of Abs, cancer cells were pretreated with each Ab at a concentration described above for 30\u00a0minutes and then placed on the CAF layer together with each inhibitor sample. In the case of anti\u2010FN Ab, CAFs were pretreated with the Ab. After incubation for 5\u00a0hours, culture images were taken under a fluorescent microscope and the percentage of spread cancer cells was determined in each image with similar cell distribution.ImmunocytochemistryImmunofluorescent staining was undertaken as described previously. 22  Cultures or frozen tissue sections were fixed with 10% formalin, blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA/PBS. They were treated with the anti\u2010FN mouse mAb FN12\u20108 or the anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin mouse mAb SHE78\u20107 at \u00d7100 dilution at 4\u00b0C overnight and then with the second Ab conjugated with Cy3 (red) or Alexa Fluor 488 (green) at room temperature for 2\u00a0hours. After each treatment, the cultures were extensively washed with PBS. For double immunofluorescent staining, the anti\u2010FN mouse mAb was prelabeled with FITC and applied to the E\u2010cadherin\u2010 or integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21\u2010stained samples. Fluorescent images were obtained under the Carl Zeiss 710 laser scanning microscope with ZEN software.Small interfering RNAs and transfectionGene suppression (knockdown) of integrin \u03b15 in DLD\u20101 cells and FN in CAFs was carried out using pools of four siRNAs and a negative control RNA (Dharmacon SMARTpool; GE Healthcare) as described previously. 22  Two or three days after the transfection, these cells were used to determine the knockdown effects. The downregulation of the targets was confirmed by immunoblotting.Sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting analysis (western blotting)Confluent cultures in 6\u2010cm culture dishes were washed with PBS and dissolved in 0.5\u00a0mL lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X\u2010100. The SDS\u2010PAGE was carried out on Bio\u2010Rad Mini\u2010Protean gels (4%\u201015%). Ten microliters of the SDS\u2010treated cell lysates was applied on each lane. Immunoblotting was undertaken by the standard procedure, and the separated antigens were visualized by the ECL method.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was evaluated with an unpaired, two\u2010tailed Student\u2019s t test. A P value of less than .05 was considered significant. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical data shown are the means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD with indicated n values.RESULTSSingle cell invasion and signal inhibitorsTo compare with the collective invasion, single cell invasion was carried out using GFP\u2010labeled A549 lung cancer cells. When the A549 cells were incubated alone on the low cell attachment microfabricated EZSPHERE plate overnight, they formed cell aggregates or loose spheroids (pure spheroids) (Figure\u00a01A), but they produced solid spheroids when mixed with CAFs (Figure\u00a01B). When the A549/CAF hybrid spheroids were placed into collagen gel, the cancer cells individually migrated on extremely elongated protrusions of CAFs. The fastest cancer cells migrated on the CAF protrusions at speed over 200\u00a0\u00b5m/d (approximately 250\u00a0\u00b5m/d in Figure\u00a01C). When the loose aggregates of A549 cells were placed alone into collagen gel, they very slowly invaded the matrix (below 50\u00a0\u00b5m/d) (Figure\u00a01D).Spheroid formation and single cell invasion in 3\u2010D collagen gel of A549 cells.

Scale lines, 100\u00a0\u00b5mUsing this tumor invasion model, we examined the effects of some signal inhibitors on invasion of Panc\u20101 pancreatic cancer cells (Figures\u00a02 and S1). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited the cell invasion, whereas the TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling inhibitor SB431542 and the Rock inhibitor Y27632 promoted it. The MEK inhibitor U0126 appeared to have a weak inhibitory activity, but the activity of the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI\u20101 was unclear. The proinvasive activity of SB431542 was also found for A549 cells in our previous study with a different coculture model. 27  These data indicated that this tumor invasion model can be used for surveying various inhibitors and activators.Effects of signaling inhibitors on collagen gel invasion of Panc\u20101 cells. Hybrid spheroids of Panc\u20101 and WI\u201038 cells were incubated for 2\u00a0d with 2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L U0126, 5\u00a0\u00b5mol/L LY294002, 10\u00a0\u00b5mol/L\u00a0mmol/L SB431542, 10\u00a0\u00b5mol/L Y27632, or 2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L TAPI\u20101 in the culture medium.

B, Representative images from each group. Scale line, 100\u00a0\u00b5mCollective invasion of colon cancer cellsWe next attempted to establish a collective cancer invasion model using similar hybrid spheroids. This study used two adenocarcinoma cell lines, DLD\u20101 (colon cancer) and MCF\u20107 (mammary cancer). DLD\u20101 cells were stably labeled with GFP, whereas MCF\u20107 cells were stained with FITC dye before use. Western blotting analysis showed that both cell lines expressed high levels of E\u2010cadherin (Figure\u00a03A, left panels). Integrin\u2010\u03b15 was expressed at a lower level in MCF\u20107 cells than DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a03A, right panels). When incubated alone on the low cell attachment microplates, both cell lines formed solid spheroids as compared with A549 cells, suggesting the E\u2010cadherin\u2010mediated tight cell junction (Figure\u00a03B,C, upper panels, also see Figure\u00a01A). The two cell lines also formed solid spheroids with CAFs (Figure\u00a03B,C, lower panels). When CAFs were labeled with a red fluorescent dye, the resultant hybrid spheroids showed that CAFs were mostly localized in the spheroid core in DLD\u20101/CAF and MCF7/CAF spheroids, whereas they appeared even in the spheroid surface in A549/CAF spheroids (Figure\u00a0S2). Like DLD\u20101 and MCF\u20107, squamous cell carcinoma lines expressing E\u2010cadherin, such as A431, VMRC, and CaSki, formed hard pure spheroids due to their tight intercellular junction, whereas three poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cell lines did not form solid spheroids (Figure\u00a0S3).Expression of E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad) and integrin\u2010\u03b15 (Itg\u2010\u03b15) in DLD\u20101 and MCF\u20107 cells and their spheroid formation.

Protein loaded per lane: 10\u00a0\u00b5g for E\u2010Cad and 30\u00a0\u00b5g for Itg\u2010\u03b15. B, C, Phase\u2010contrast images (left) and fluorescent images (right) of pure spheroids (upper panels) and hybrid spheroids (lower panels) of DLD\u20101 (green) (B) and MCF\u20107 (green) cells (C). Scale lines, 50\u00a0\u00b5mThe pure spheroids of DLD\u20101 or hybrid spheroids of DLD\u20101 with CAFs were embedded into collagen gel (Figures\u00a04 and S4). In the case of the hybrid spheroids, DLD\u20101 cells collectively invaded the matrix but very poorly and slowly (Figure\u00a04A). Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts also poorly migrated from the spheroids. The poor migration of CAFs was thought to result from their localization in the spheroid core (Figures\u00a03B and S2B). This was contrasted with the case of A549/CAF spheroids (Figures\u00a01B and S2A). We tested the effects of some cytokines and signal inhibitors. The TGF\u2010\u03b2 inhibitor SB431542 clearly promoted the invasion of both DLD\u20101 cells and CAFs (Figures\u00a04B and S4B,F), whereas Y27632, which promoted single cell invasion (Figure\u00a02A,B), did not show the proinvasive effect on DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a0S4C,G). Like SB431542, EGF and TNF\u2010\u03b1 individually stimulated the invasive activity of both cancer cells and CAFs (Figure\u00a04C,D). SB431542 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 appeared to synergistically promote the cancer cell invasion (Figure\u00a04E). As EGF and TNF\u2010\u03b1 are known to induce EMT or stimulate cell motility, 8 ,  28 ,  29  they were supposed to loosen the cell\u2010cell interaction of DLD\u20101 cells, allowing CAFs to migrate from the spheroid core. Indeed, some DLD\u20101 cells migrated as single cells at invasion fronts in the presence of EGF or TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Figure\u00a04C,E, yellow arrows). In any case, the collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells was associated with elongated CAF protrusions (CAF fibers) (Figure\u00a04A,B,D,E, white arrows). Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 is a well\u2010known EMT inducer. Although TGF\u2010\u03b2 appeared to loosen the intercellular junction of DLD\u20101 cells, it strongly inhibited the collagen invasion of both CAFs and DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a04G). Judging from the spheroid outgrowth, SB431542, EGF, nor TNF\u2010\u03b1 seemed to have significant growth effect on DLD\u20101 cells, at least during the 7\u00a0days of incubation.Collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells (green) from hybrid spheroids with cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and its influential factors. A\u2010E, Hybrid spheroids were incubated for 7\u00a0d in collagen gel without (A) or with 10\u00a0mmol/L SB431542 (B), 10\u00a0ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (C), 10\u00a0ng/mL tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) (D), or TNF\u2010\u03b1\u00a0+\u00a0SB431542 (E).

Note adhesive pseudopodia in the magnified inset (left panel)We also examined the effect of the anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin Ab on DLD\u20101 cell invasion. This Ab, which blocked the cell\u2010cell interaction in 2\u2010D cultures, rather promoted the CAF\u2010dependent matrix invasion of DLD\u20101 cells even in the absence of SB431542 (Figures\u00a04F and S4D). The single cell migration on fibroblast protrusions was enhanced by the Ab more evidently than EGF or TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Figure\u00a04F, yellow arrows). This indicated that the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin interaction is not important for the DLD\u20101 invasion in our experimental model. 21  However, DLD\u20101 cells could not migrate from their pure spheroids (Figure\u00a0S4H).When SB431542 and Y27632 were applied to the pure spheroids of CAFs, the former supported the migration of CAFs with larger protrusions than control cells, whereas the latter promoted rapid migration of CAFs with fine and short protrusions (Figure\u00a0S5). Unlike the case of the single cell invasion, the size and strength of Y27632\u2010stimulated CAF protrusions seemed insufficient for supporting the clusters of DLD\u20101 cells (Figures\u00a02, S4,and S5).Interaction between cancer cells and CAFs during collective cell invasionAs shown in Figure\u00a04, the collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells was found along with elongated CAF protrusions. The migration of multicellular clusters was rarely found on single fibroblast protrusions. In addition, we often observed the migration of single cells or small cell clusters at invasion fronts (Figure\u00a05A, yellow arrows). This caused the separation of the leader cells from the follower cell clusters.Double immunofluorescent (IF) staining for fibronectin (FN) and E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad) of collagen gel culture of DLD\u20101/cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) spheroids.

Scale lines, 100\u00a0\u00b5mThe requirement of stable or mechanically strong CAF fibers for collective invasion was also illustrated by a time\u2010lapse experiment (Figure\u00a04H, Video S1). Cancer cells collectively and slowly migrated, searching for stable CAF fibers. Detachment from CAFs terminated their collective invasion. In this experiment, the migration speed was calculated to be approximately 44\u00a0\u00b5m/d. This is far slower than the speed of A549 cell migration (250\u00a0\u00b5m/d), as shown in Figure\u00a01C.Immunostaining for FN more clearly showed that migrating DLD\u20101 cells adhered to assembled structures of multiple CAF fibers, named bundle structures, which were densely stained for FN (red) (Figure\u00a05A,B). In addition, immunostaining of E\u2010cadherin showed that the majority of cancer cells collectively migrated on the CAF fibers, keeping E\u2010cadherin\u2010mediated intercellular junctions (Figure\u00a05C). These data suggested that DLD\u20101 cells adhered to CAF fibers through interaction with FN assembled on the surface of CAFs, as reported in the single cell invasion. 22  Association of invading cancer cells with FN\u2010rich CAF fibers was further examined in 2\u2010D cocultures by double immunofluorescent staining. When DLD\u20101 cells were placed on a confluent CAF monolayer, they formed E\u2010cadherin\u2010linked cell clusters along with marked FN fibrils (Figure\u00a06A). Peripheral cancer cells in the cell clusters and singly migrating cancer cells showed strong signals for integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21, which were often colocalized with FN fibrils (Figure\u00a06B,C). The possible integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction was also suggested in the immunohistochemistry of human colon adenocarcinoma tissue. Consistent with the 2\u2010D cultures, invasive E\u2010cadherin\u2010linked cancer cell clusters were found in stroma with abundant FN fibrils (Figure\u00a06D). Cancer cells at invasion fronts, which contacted with FN fibrils, showed stronger signals for integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 than those of inner cancer cells (Figure\u00a06E,F). Similar collective invasion was found in all of the 10 colorectal cancers examined. These data supported the possible mechanism that colon cancer cells bind to CAFs through integrin/FN interaction.Collective invasion of colon cancer cells in contact with fibronectin (FN) fibrils in 2\u2010D cultures (A\u2010C) and human cancer (D\u2010F): double immunofluorescent (IF) staining for FN (green) and E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad, red) or integrin (Itg)\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 (red).

Scale lines, 10\u00a0\u00b5m (A\u2010D, F) and 20\u00a0\u00b5m (E)To verify the molecular mechanism, the DLD\u20101/CAF interaction was investigated by using function\u2010blocking Abs in 2\u2010D cultures. DLD\u20101 cells rapidly adhered to the confluent CAF layer and spread in spindle shapes (Figure\u00a0S6A). This adhesion was strongly inhibited by Abs against integrin\u2010\u03b15, \u2010\u03b15\u03b21, \u2010\u03b21, and FN and by RGD peptide (Figures\u00a07A and S7A). Anti\u2010integrin\u2010\u03b1v and anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin Abs significantly but very weakly inhibited the cell adhesion. These results indicated that DLD\u20101 cells bound to CAFs mainly through the interaction between integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 on DLD\u20101 cells and FN on CAFs. The integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction was also verified in the 3\u2010D invasion assay with DLD\u20101 cells (Figures\u00a07B and S7B). The Abs against integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 and FN, as well as the RGD peptide, significantly blocked the DLD\u20101 invasion in the collagen matrix. Similar to the effects of the function\u2010blocking Abs, knockdown of the integrin\u2010\u03b15 gene in DLD\u20101 cells or the FN gene in CAFs clearly inhibited the adhesion of DLD\u20101 cells to CAFs (Figures\u00a07C and S8). In addition, the two kinds of gene knockdown appeared to inhibit the CAF\u2010dependent collagen gel invasion of DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a07D).Inhibitory effects of function\u2010blocking Abs (A, B) and gene suppression (C, D) on 2\u2010D adhesion to cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (A, C) and on 3\u2010D collagen gel invasion (B, D) of DLD\u20101 cells.

D, Representative images from each group (eight spheroids)Collective invasion of MCF\u20107 mammary carcinoma cellsCancer\u2010associated fibroblast\u2010dependent collective invasion was also examined with MCF\u20107 cells. When the hybrid spheroids of MCF\u20107 with CAFs were embedded into collagen gel, CAFs migrated from the spheroids, supporting the collective migration of MCF\u20107 cells (Figures\u00a08A and S9A). Therefore, the proinvasive effect of SB431542, if any, was not evident. Unlike DLD\u20101 cells, some MCF\u20107 cells migrated individually (Figures\u00a08A,C and S9A, yellow arrows). This might be related to the lower expression of integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 and the lower adhesive activity to CAFs in this cell line as compared with DLD\u20101 cells (Figures\u00a03A, right panel, and S6B). Epidermal growth factor further promoted the single cell invasion along with CAF fibers, probably inducing EMT or stimulating cell motility. The collective invasion of MCF\u20107 cells was always supported by bundles of multiple CAF fibers. This is shown more clearly by a time\u2010lapse experiment (Video S2) and immunostaining for E\u2010cadherin and FN (Figure\u00a08E,F). The immunostaining showed that MCF\u20107 cells with E\u2010cadherin junction migrated on bundles of CAF fibers, forming cell clusters. It is noted that larger bundles of CAF fibers supported the migration of larger clusters of cancer cells. Although EGF promoted single cell invasion, the cancer cells bound to large CAF fibers maintained or reproduced tight cell\u2010cell junctions (Figure\u00a0S9E, white arrow).Collective invasion of MCF\u20107 cells (green) in collagen gel (A\u2010D) and double immunofluorescent (IF) staining for fibronectin (FN, green) and E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad, red) (E\u2010F).

The boxed field in (E) is magnified in (F). Scale line, 100\u00a0\u00b5mDISCUSSIONCollective invasion is the major mode of cancer metastasis. 23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  30  This type of invasion is usually observed in E\u2010cadherin\u2010positive epithelial cancers, with some exceptions. 23 ,  25  In this study we tested if this invasion mode can be explained by our previously proposed mechanism for single cell invasion. 22  Our results indicated again that cancer cells invaded the collagen matrix by directly binding to FN fibrils assembled on CAFs. As reported previously, 22  CAFs extended their protrusions to form fiber structures in collagen gel, and FN fibrils were densely accumulated on their surface. The FN fibrils assembled on CAF fibers seemed to be the most preferable substrate for cancer cells in the 3\u2010D collagen matrix. This mechanism seems common to both the single\u2010cell and the collective invasion modes. Integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 is known to be a major receptor for FN.10,11 Our previous and present studies suggest that integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 plays a major role in the binding of cancer cells to the FN fibrils on CAFs, but other types of FN receptors, including integrin\u2010\u03b1v\u03b23, might be important, depending on cell types. Important differences between the two invasion modes were the E\u2010cadherin\u2010based cell\u2010cell connection and the density of CAF fibers supporting the migration of the cancer cell clusters. Both DLD\u20101 and MCF\u20107 cells formed E\u2010cadherin\u2010linked cell clusters, and their collective migration in collagen gel required assembly of multiple CAF fibers (bundle structure) as the stable substrate, although A549 cells individually migrated on single CAF fibers. This seems reasonable when the mechanical capacity of CAFs to hold large multicellular clusters is considered. Conversely, these cancer cells appeared to integrate multiple CAF fibers to form their bundle structures, probably by the strong cell\u2010cell connection.The collective invasion is thought to be controlled by the coordinated interplay between cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010ECM interactions. 24  The leader cells at the invasion front acquire a mechanical traction force to pull the follower cell cluster by adhering to suitable substrates. Recent studies with 3\u2010D collagen cultures have shown that CAFs play important roles in leading collective cancer cell migration. 19 ,  21  One group reported that CAFs lead collective migration of A431 cells by directly binding to the cancer cells through the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin junction. 21  Consistent with their and our previous findings, the present study showed the importance of the direct cancer cell\u2010CAF interaction in collective cancer invasion. In our models, however, DLD\u20101 cells adhered to CAFs, at least mainly, through integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction. The anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin Ab stimulated the CAF\u2010dependent DLD\u20101 cell invasion, especially their single cell invasion. This is inconsistent with the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin junction model, 21  but agreed with a recent study that reported that genetic deletion of E\u2010cadherin enhances the invasive activity of ductal carcinoma cells in vitro but reduces tumor growth and metastasis in mice. 31  However, our results do not exclude the possibility that the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin interaction might be involved in the DLD\u20101/CAF interaction under some specific steps.The present study showed that the speed of collective invasion was far lower than the single cell invasion in the spheroidal invasion experiments. The E\u2010cadherin junction is obviously an impediment for cell migration. How do such cancer cells efficiently metastasize in vivo? Many mechanisms have been proposed for this question. 24 ,  32 ,  33  In these mechanisms, cancer cells transiently, reversibly, or partially undergo EMT during the process of distant metastasis. 32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35  Such epithelial plasticity was also found in the present study. We found that EGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and the TGF\u2010\u03b2 inhibitor SB431542 promoted the collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells. Both EGF and TNF\u2010\u03b1, which often induce EMT, 8 ,  28 ,  29  enhanced cancer cell migration, possibly by dissociating or loosening their E\u2010cadherin junctions and by enhancing cell motility. It is likely that these and other cytokines in the microenvironment would transiently enhance cell migration by breaking the cell\u2010cell junction during their collective invasion in vivo. After enhanced migration, they would reconstruct tight cell\u2010cell junctions as the cell number increases on the stable CAF substrate. Compared with the two cytokines, the effect of SB431542 was somewhat strange because TGF\u2010\u03b2 is an EMT inducer. However, little is known about the activity of TGF\u2010\u03b2 in 3\u2010D conditions. Although TGF\u2010\u03b2 appeared to loosen the intercellular junction of DLD\u20101 cells, it strongly inhibited the collagen invasion of both CAFs and DLD\u20101 cells. We previously found that SB431542 stimulates HGF expression in fibroblasts and tumor cell invasion in collagen gel. 27  Hepatocyte growth factor promotes migration of normal and cancer cells in 2\u2010D and 3\u2010D conditions, and its expression is negatively regulated by TGF\u2010\u03b2. 36 ,  37  Therefore, SB431542 seemed to enhance the cancer cell invasion by stimulating the outgrowth of CAFs in our 3\u2010D invasion model. Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 is known to have both tumor\u2010suppressive and proinvasive effects depending on tumor stages and experimental conditions. 2 ,  3  Obviously, extensive and careful studies are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of TGF\u2010\u03b2 inhibitors.It is also noted that in our 3\u2010D invasion models and 2\u2010D cocultures, cancer cells bound to CAF fibers showed elongated shapes and sometimes migrated alone (Figures\u00a05A, 8Ac, S6A,B, and S9A,C). The integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21\u2010mediated adhesion to fibrillary FN facilitates cancer cell invasion by activating FAK, Erk, Akt, and other signal mediators, hence remodeling the cytoskeleton. 22 ,  38 ,  39 ,  40  Thus, the leader cancer cells could gain a traction force to pull the follower cancer cells by FN/integrin signaling. It seems possible that small clusters of such leader cells are separated from the follower cell clusters and seeded into circulation. Such tumor cell clusters in circulation are thought to cause distant metastasis much more efficiently than singly circulating cells. 41 ,  42  Our results are consistent with previous reports showing the importance of integrin expression in tumor prognosis. 43 ,  44  In conclusion, we could recapitulate the collective invasion of colon and breast cancer cell lines in a simple 3\u2010D collagen coculture model with CAFs. The cancer cells collectively migrated through the collagen matrix while binding to bundles of CAF fibers through the integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 and FN interaction. These results reinforce the ideas that fibrosis, altered ECM, and local cytokines contribute to tumor progression. 32 ,  45  Many types of 3\u2010D experimental models for cancer studies have been reported so far. 46  Our experimental model uses two major components in the tumor microenvironment, fibroblasts and collagen, as well as their products. Our invasion assay is simple and rapid and suitable for investigating various interactions between cancer cells and CAFs. This method can be used for investigating the complex mechanisms of cancer invasion as well as for drug screening.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors do not have any financial support or relationship that may pose conflict of interest.Supporting informationREFERENCESThe microenvironment of the tumour\u2010host interfaceThe tumour microenvironment as a target for chemopreventionStromal fibroblasts in cancer initiation and progressionStromal myofibroblasts are drivers of invasive cancer growthThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerMolecular requirements for epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition during tumor progressionHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationTumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha stimulates the epithelial\u2010to\u2010 mesenchymal transition of human colonic organoidsMatrix metalloproteinases: regulators of the tumor microenvironmentFibronectin fibrillogenesis, a cell\u2010mediated matrix assembly processFibronectin: How its aberrant expression in tumors may improve therapeutic targetingFibronectin in Cancer: Friend or FoeLaminin\u20105: Unique biological activity and role in tumor growth and invasionLaminin 332 in squamous\u2010cell carcinomaHighly sensitive detection of invasive lung cancer cells by novel antibody against amino\u2010terminal domain of laminin gamma2 chainFibronectin\u2010guided migration of carcinoma collectivesCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts lead tumor invasion through integrin\u2010\u03b23\u2010dependent fibronectin assemblyCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts promote directional cancer cell migration by aligning fibronectinFibroblast\u2010led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cellsDirect cancer\u2010stromal interaction increases fibroblast proliferation and enhances invasive properties of scirrhous\u2010type gastric carcinoma cellsA mechanically active heterotypic E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin adhesion enables fibroblasts to drive cancer cell invasionCancer cell migration on elongate protrusions of fibroblasts in collagen matrixCancer cell invasion and EMT marker expression: a three\u2010dimensional study of the human cancer\u2010host interfaceIlluminating breast cancer invasion: diverse roles for cell\u2013cell interactionsCollective invasion in ductal and lobular breast cancer associates with distant metastasisMicrofabric vessels for embryoid body formation and rapid differentiation of pluripotent stem cellsInhibition of transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 signaling potentiates tumor cell invasion into collagen matrix induced by fibroblast\u2010derived hepatocyte growth factorExpression of laminin gamma2 chain monomer enhances invasive growth of human carcinoma cells in vivoEpithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition stimulates human cancer cells to extend microtubule\u2010based invasive protrusions and suppresses cell growth in collagen gelAn emerging tumor invasion mechanism about the collective cell migrationE\u2010cadherin is required for metastasis in multiple models of breast cancerCancer invasion and the microenvironment: plasticity and reciprocityContext\u2010dependent EMT programs in cancer metastasisMetastatic progression is associated with dynamic changes in the local microenvironmentStromal fibroblasts induce metastatic tumor cell clusters via epithelial\u2013mesenchymal plasticityNegative regulation of hepatocyte growth factor gene expression in human lung fibroblasts and leukemic cells by transforming growth factor\u2010beta1 and glucocorticoidsTransforming growth factor\u2010beta signaling\u2010deficient fibroblasts enhance hepatocyte growth factor signaling in mammary carcinoma cells to promote scattering and invasionIntegrin \u03b15\u03b21 facilitates cancer cell invasion through enhanced contractile forces\u03b15\u03b21\u2010Integrin promotes tension\u2010dependent mammary epithelial cell invasion by engaging the fibronectin synergy siteLeader cells regulate collective cell migration via Rac activation in the downstream signaling of integrin \u03b21 and PI3KCirculating tumor cell clusters oligoclonal precursors of breast cancer metastasisA collective route to metastasis: Seeding by tumor cell clustersIncreased beta1 integrin is associated with decreased survival in invasive breast cancerIntegrin expression profiling identifies integrin alpha5 and beta1 as prognostic factors in early stage non\u2010small cell lung cancerTumor\u2010stromal crosstalk in pancreatic cancer and tissue fibrosisEngineering cancer microenvironments for in vitro 3\u2010D tumor models"

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method.

No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

The roles played by ROS in the hallmarks of cancer have been well reviewed. ROS such as superoxide anion (O2\u2022\u2212), hydroxyl (\u2022OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exert a multifaceted role at the cellular level. While high levels of ROS can induce bio-molecular damage and even cell death when the levels exceed the anti-oxidative capacity of cells to detoxify them, moderate levels of ROS are essential for physiological signaling in promoting proliferation and differentiation. In normal cells, redox homeostasis is tightly regulated by balancing ROS generation with their scavenging systems. However, in malignant cells aberrant regulation of redox homeostasis is often observed. Activation of oncogenes, aberrant metabolism, and defective tumor suppressor genes are intrinsic factors known to promote ROS production in cancer cells, partly through activation of ROS-generating enzymes such as NADPH oxidases. The enhanced oxidative stress observed in cancer cells can result not only from ROS overproduction, but also from decreased levels or inactivation of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutases (SODs).We have previously shown that expression levels of the extracellular form of SOD (EcSOD or SOD3) is significantly down-regulated in a majority of breast carcinomas and its expression levels inversely correlated with clinical stage. Overexpression of this antioxidant in breast cancer cells inhibited in vitro proliferation, clonogenic survival, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis. EcSOD is the only extracellular enzyme that scavenges superoxide (O2\u2022\u2212) which is the essential first step in eliminating the downstream production of more potent ROS (e.g. H2O2, \u2022OH, and ONOO\u2212). Considering its unique cell-surface localization and the fact that the substrate for EcSOD, O2\u2022\u2212, crosses membranes poorly, loss of EcSOD is anticipated to promote an oxidative extracellular environment that will likely alter autocrine and/or paracrine signal transductions initiated at cell surface receptors.Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been shown to be ROS-sensitive or utilize ROS-dependent mechanisms for activation. ROS can activate signal transduction pathways by oxidizing and therefore inhibiting the cysteine regions of the active sites of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which promotes activation of tyrosine kinases. Recently, oxidative stress has also been suggested to be involved in activating c-Met signaling. Therefore, loss of EcSOD expression and the resulting increase in extracellular O2\u2022\u2212 is expected to promote HGF/c-Met signaling. Upon activation, c-Met undergoes phosphorylation that evokes a variety of oncogenic responses leading to increased proliferation, scattering and motility, invasion, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In breast cancer, c-Met is overexpressed in 20\u201330% of cases, and is a strong, independent predictor of decreased survival. Moreover, several types of signal cooperation and cross-talk between c-Met and EGFR pathways have been demonstrated in recent years. This has driven the development of inhibitors that target c-Met as an anti-cancer strategy.In addition to overexpression, c-Met activation can be promoted through mutations, or autocrine signaling in malignant cells. Mutations in c-Met that confer its constitutive activation independent of its ligand (hepatocyte growth factor, HGF) has been observed and autocrine up-regulation of HGF has been reported in lung cancer. However, breast cancer cells rarely express the c-Met ligand, but often acquire HGF from stroma fibroblasts or the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) via a paracrine interaction. CAFs are now recognized to be one of the key players in the tumor microenvironment that not only supports cancer cells but also interacts with the other stroma cells such as macrophages and endothelial cells, in a community fashion, to promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, malignant progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. These fibroblasts differ from the normal quiescent fibroblasts in their activated phenotypes and their pro-tumorigenic secretory profile. Pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative phenotype have also recently been associated with CAFs. Understanding factors that contribute to the paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling during cancer-fibroblast interactions will therefore have a positive clinical impact for c-Met overexpressing cancers.The objective of this study is to determine the effect of EcSOD and oxidative stress on HGF/c-Met-signaling in breast cancer. We found that overexpression of EcSOD inhibited HGF-mediated c-Met phosphorylation and resulted in an inhibition of three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel growth of MDA-MB231. This antioxidant enzyme also inhibited HGF-mediated cancer-fibroblast interactions in our co-culture model. In a prolonged co-culture study where breast cancer cells were seeded for multiple passages with mammary fibroblasts, followed by re-isolation of individual cell types, overexpression of EcSOD significantly suppressed the invasiveness of breast cancer cells that were pre-exposed to HGF-secreting fibroblasts, when compared to the parental MDA-MB231 cells. Concurrently, the isolated HGF secreting fibroblasts, which were co-cultured with EcSOD\u2013overexpressing MDA-MB231 cells showed attenuated phenotype in their ability to promote na\u00efve breast cancer cell invasion.Furthermore, we have shown that up-regulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) contributes to the activated phenotype of HGF expressing fibroblasts, via promoting oxidative stress. Scavenging ROS with an SOD mimetic, MnTE-2-PyP significantly suppressed the HGF-stimulated 3D growth and invasion of MDA-MB231 cells. In addition, targeting the ROS-generating Nox4 enzyme inhibited the ability of activated fibroblasts to contract collagen matrix. Our in vivo study further showed that scavenging ROS with EcSOD in MDA-MB231 significantly inhibited HGF-mediated tumor growth in mice. Overall, our study indicates a contributing role of an oxidative tumor microenvironment in promoting an activated-phenotype of fibroblasts in addition to supporting HGF/c-Met signaling during cancer-fibroblast interactions.RESULTSEcSOD inhibits c-Met phosphorylationTo determine if scavenging cell surface-generated ROS with EcSOD will affect the phosphorylation status of RTKs, we utilized PathScan\u00ae RTK Signaling Antibody Array Kit (Cell Signaling). As shown in Figure 1A, amongst the 28 RTKs screened, the most significant change is observed for c-Met phosphorylation (Pan-Tyr), where overexpression of EcSOD (Ec.20 cell line) drastically inhibited activation of this RTK relative to its vector control MDA-MB231 cell line. Quantification of the pixel intensities is shown on the right bar graph (A), revealing a more than 85% decrease in c-Met phosphorylation in Ec.20 cells versus MDA-MB231. The array shown in Figure 1A also shows a down-regulation of c-Abl phosphorylation (pan-Tyr), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase which has recently been shown to be activated downstream of c-Met. To further confirm that overexpression of EcSOD affects c-Met activation in MDA-MB231, we performed western blot analysis. Figure 1B shows that when cells were stimulated with a recombinant human HGF (rHGF), c-Met phosphorylation (Y1234/1235) was significantly suppressed in Ec.20 cell line when compared to that of MDA-MB231 cells. Moreover, transient overexpression of this extracellular antioxidant using an adenovirus vector (AdEcSOD) at M.O.I. of 50 also resulted in an inhibition of c-Met activation relative to the control vector (AdEmpty) infected sample. To determine whether the superoxide scavenging activity of EcSOD is required for this inhibition, we overexpressed an inactive form of EcSOD where two critical residues were mutated as previously described. The inactive EcSOD expression was generated to be expressed only under doxycycline induction and the cell line was named iMutEcSOD. When iMutEcSOD cells were treated with doxycycline, we observed no alterations in c-Met signaling as shown on the right panel in Figure 1B. These data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is sensitive to ROS modulation. To further show that the inhibitory effect of the wild type EcSOD on c-Met is not limited to MDA-MB231 cell line, we repeated the assay with another basal-like breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB468 and demonstrated similar down-regulation of this signaling pathway (Figure 1C).Overexpression of EcSOD inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and HGF-stimulated Matrigel growth of MDA-MB231 cells(A) Cell lysates of the parental MDA-MB231 or an EcSOD overexpressing stable cell line (Ec.20) were screened for activation of a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases using the PathScan\u00ae RTK Signaling Antibody Array.

Pixel intensities of the array signal is shown on the bar graph. (B) Left\u2013western blot analysis confirming that either transient overexpression of EcSOD using adenovirus vectors (AdEcSOD) or stable overexpression in Ec.20 clones showed significant decreases in c-Met activation (phosphorylation at Y1234/1235). Cells were serum starved overnight followed by rHGF stimulation (50 ng/mL) for 15 min prior to cell lysate preparation. Right\u2013Overexpression of inactive mutant EcSOD (N180A, R186A) did not affect c-Met activation in MDA-MB231 cells. Doxycycline (100 ng/mL) was used to induce the expression of the mutant EcSOD in iMutEcSOD cells. Cells were serum starved overnight followed by HGF stimulation (50 ng/mL) for 15 and 60 min prior to cell lysate preparation. Signal intensity of phosphorylated c-Met over total c-Met was analyzed by densitometry as shown. (C) Phosphorylation of c-Met (Y1234/1235) was also inhibited by EcSOD in MDA-MB468 cells. Cells were infected with AdEcSOD or AdEmpty for 24 hours prior to stimulation with 50 ng/mL of rHGF. Cell lysate was then harvested for western blot analysis after 15 min of stimulation. Representative blots from 3 independent experiments are shown. Signal intensity of phosphorylated c-Met over total c-Met and phosphorylated p44/42 over total p44/42 was analyzed by densitometry as shown.

Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 separate samples.EcSOD up-regulates extracellular thrombospondin levelsTo further determine whether EcSOD mediates suppression of c-Met signaling via an alteration of secreted factors, we performed an extracellular protein array analysis. As shown in Figure 1D, levels of thrombospondin-1 and 2 (TSP-1 and TSP-2) were significantly increased in conditioned media of Ec.20 compared to that of the vector control cells. Both TSP-1 and TSP-2 are anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic factors that show inverse correlation with malignant progression in breast cancer. TSP-1 possesses a strong affinity for HGF which mobilizes HGF away from the extracellular matrix and cell surface proteoglycans hence preventing its receptor binding. Our results suggest that EcSOD inhibits c-Met activation partly through sequestering of its ligand via anti-angiogenic TSPs.EcSOD inhibits HGF-mediated breast cancer invasive morphology and growth in 3D cultureSince tumor stroma cells, such as activated fibroblasts are the predominant source of HGF, we determined if EcSOD will affect the cancer cell-fibroblast interactions in the context of HGF stimulation. Here, we co-cultured MDA-MB231 cells with mammary fibroblasts that were generated to overexpress HGF (RMF-HGF). The parental fibroblasts, RMF are non-malignant fibroblasts isolated from reduction mammoplasty as described. The 3D co-culture system (Figure 1E) shows that RMF-HGF greatly stimulated the growth and stellate formation of MDA-MB231 relative to the cells co-cultured with RMF. This stimulatory effect of RMF-HGF was inhibited in the presence of EcSOD, where Ec.20 cells showed stunted 3D growth with minimal stellate formation when co-cultured with RMF-HGF. Growth of MDA-MB231 and Ec.20 cells under the RMF-HGF stimulation was quantified using a luciferase activity assay and presented on a bar graph in Figure 1E. The inactive mutant form of EcSOD on the other hand, did not affect the 3D stellate formation nor the growth of MDA-MB231, in the presence of HGF, as shown in Figure 1F. Moreover, overexpression of the wild type EcSOD with an adenovirus vector (AdEcSOD) suppressed the HGF-stimulated Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB468 cells (Figure 1G-top panel), whereas the mutant EcSOD has no influence on the invasiveness of breast cancer cells, when conditioned media harvested from RMF-HGF fibroblasts were used as a chemoattractant (Figure 1G-bottom panel).Prolonged co-culture with EcSOD overexpressing breast cancer cells attenuated pro-invasive phenotype of RMF-HGFTo determine the effects of scavenging extracellular ROS with EcSOD on the reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and activated fibroblasts, we performed serial passages of MDA-MB231 cells with mammary fibroblasts using a transwell co-culture chamber as illustrated in Figure 2A. After four passages, fibroblast-co-cultured MDA-MB231 and Ec.20 cells were isolated and tested for their invasiveness through Matrigel. Figure 2B shows that as expected, MDA-MB231 cells are more invasive after prolonged co-cultivation with RMF-HGF (CC.RMF-HGF) when compared to co-cultivation with RMF (CC.RMF). In contrast, invasiveness of Ec.20 cells was not affected by the pro-longed interactions with RMF-HGF (CC.RMF-HGF), suggesting that EcSOD inhibits HGF-mediated invasion of cancer cells.Prolonged co-culture with Ec.20 breast cancer cells inhibits pro-invasive phenotype of RMF-HGF(A) Breast cancer cells were in-directly co-cultured with RMF or RMF-HGF for 4 passages using transwell chambers. Breast cancer cells were subsequently isolated and evaluated for their invasiveness through Matrigel as shown in (B). Fibroblasts were also isolated and examined for their ability to promote invasion of na\u00efve MDA-MB231 cells (C). Error bars = SD of 3 separate samples, representative data from N = 3 separate experiments.In parallel, RMF and RMF-HGF were also isolated from the co-cultures and tested for their ability to promote breast cancer cell invasion. As shown in Figure 2A, fibroblasts were seeded into the bottom wells of invasion chambers where na\u00efve MDA-MB231 cells were seeded on the Matrigel layer on the top inserts. The bar graph in Figure 2C shows that RMF-HGF that were pre-educated by MDA-MB231 in this co-culture system (CC.MDA-MB231) became more aggressive in their ability to promote breast cancer cell invasion when compared to the fibroblasts that have not been co-cultured with the cancer cells. This shows a reciprocal pro-oncogenic stimulation between the fibroblasts and the breast cancer cells. However, RMF-HGF that were co-cultured with Ec.20 cells (CC.Ec.20) exhibited suppressed ability of this process. These data imply that ROS are involved in regulating the reciprocal cancer cell-fibroblast interactions in the context of HGF/c-Met activation.HGF expressing fibroblasts exhibit higher levels of ROS and an up-regulation of NADPH oxidase 4Since RMF-HGF shows an attenuated phenotype after the prolonged co-culture with Ec.20 cells (Figure 2C), we next determined if this oncogenic cytokine promotes oxidative stress in the activated fibroblasts. Figure 3A shows an increase in DHE oxidation in RMF-HGF when compared to RMF, indicating a higher level of O2\u2022\u2212 generation in the HGF expressing fibroblasts. As expected, DHE oxidation decreased when RMF-HGF were treated with an SOD mimetic, MnTE. In addition to performing the DHE oxidation assay using a more superoxide-specific setting at 405 nm excitation (instead of the non-specific 488 nm excitation) and 570 nm emission, as described, we have further determined the O2\u2022\u2212 levels in the fibroblasts with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 3B, RMF-HGF indeed possess ~53% increase in superoxide-specific EPR amplitude per cell, as compared to RMF. We also utilized another oxidative stress indicator, CellROX\u00ae reagent, which is sensitive to ROS modifications. An increase in CellROX oxidation further shows that HGF overexpression promoted generation of ROS in mammary fibroblasts and this increase in ROS was reduced when cells were treated with an H2O2 scavenger, NAC (Figure 3C). In addition, cellular glutathione (GSH) levels were also analyzed as an overall indicator of cellular redox status. GSH is the most abundant antioxidant in aerobic cells and a decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized form (GSH:GSSG) indicates an increase in cellular oxidative stress, as often detected in cancer cells. We found that not only is GSH generation increased in RMF-HGF (Figure 3D), these fibroblasts also possess a close to 3-fold higher level of oxidized GSH, GSSG (Figure 3E), resulting in a significantly reduced GSH:GSSG ratio (Figure 3F), when compared to that of RMF. Taken together, these results indicate an increased oxidative stress in RMF-HGF versus RMF, due in parts to accumulation of O2\u2022\u2212 and other ROS.RMF-HGF fibroblasts generate higher levels of ROS in comparison to RMF(A) Intracellular O2\u2022\u2212 level was quantified with DHE by FACS analysis in fibroblasts. Cells were treated with 15 uM of MnTE for 16 h prior to DHE labeling. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 separate samples, representative data from N = 3 independent studies.

(D\u2013F) RMF-HGF show significantly increased levels of both the total GSH and the oxidized form, GSSG, when compared to RMF, resulting in a reduction in the GSH:GSSG ratio. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 independent experiments. (G) Real time-PCR analysis shows an up-regulation of Nox4 and CYBA in RMF-HGF vs. RMF fibroblasts. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 independent experiments. (H) Representative superoxide-specific EPR analysis of RMF-HGF. Fibroblasts were exposed to CM harvested from Ec.20 versus vector control MDA-MB231 cells (V.1) for 48 hours. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 4 separate samples. (I) Extracellular H2O2 levels as determined by Amplex Red assay. RMF and RMF-HGF were co-cultured (CC) with V.1 or Ec.20 cells for 48 prior. RMF-HGF were also treated with 10 \u03bcM of diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a pan Nox and flavoprotein inhibitor, as a control. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 separate samples.To gain insight into the mechanisms that promoted oxidative stress in RMF-HGF versus its parental fibroblast strain, RMF we profiled mRNA expression of a small panel of antioxidant related genes in these fibroblasts using TaqMan\u00ae Array Human Antioxidant Mechanisms kit. We found that CYBA (also known as p22phox) is highly up-regulated in RMF-HGF when compared to the RMF. CYBA is an essential component of the membrane-associated enzyme NADPH-oxidases (Noxs), more specifically Nox1-4. An increase in expression of CYBA suggests that activation of Noxs is one of the contributing factors in promoting oxidative stress in RMF-HGF. We have indeed confirmed that there is a 20-fold increase in Nox4 mRNA expression in RMF-HGF versus RMF (Figure 3G), while no significant difference was observed in the mRNA expression levels of Nox1-3 (data not shown). This suggests that Nox4 is the predominant source of ROS in HGF-overexpressing fibroblasts.To show the effect of cancer-fibroblast co-culture on cellular redox status of the fibroblasts, we determined the O2\u2022\u2212 levels in RMF-HGF when cultured in the presence of conditioned media harvested from Ec.20 breast cancer cells. Figure 3H shows that there was a significant reduction in superoxide-specific EPR amplitude in these fibroblasts in the presence of EcSOD-containing media (CM.Ec.20) versus vector control media (CM.V.1). Since H2O2 can cross membrane, we also measured the extracellular levels of this peroxide as an indirect indicator of the cellular H2O2 levels. Figure 3I shows that the extracellular H2O2 levels of RMF-HGF were also significantly reduced, when co-cultured with Ec.20 breast cancer cells. These results suggest that exogeneous sources of EcSOD can regulate cellular redox status of RMF-HGF.Nox4 promotes collagen contraction activity of fibroblastsTo determine the effects of Nox4-generated ROS on the activity of fibroblasts, we performed collagen contraction assays where Nox4 was overexpressed in RMF using an adenovirus vector (AdNox4). This 3D collagen gel contraction is a standard assay utilized for functionally quantifying a contractile phenotype of activated fibroblasts. Figure 4A shows that the control adenovirus vector (AdEmpty) infected RMF showed similar contraction rate compared to the mock infected control sample. However, in the presence of Nox4, a reduction in the collagen disc area was observed, indicating an increase in collagen contraction activity of AdNox4 infected RMF.Nox4 promotes collagen gel contraction ability of fibroblasts(A) RMF was induced to overexpress Nox4 with adenovirus vector (AdNox4 vs AdEmpty as a control). Collagen contraction activity of fibroblasts was then analyzed after 16 h of seeding the cells, where area of contracted collagen discs were quantified by Image J. The effect of Nox4 on contraction activity of RMF-HGF was determined by (B) inhibiting the ROS-generating activity of Nox4 with DPI and by (C) suppressing expression of Nox4 using an siRNA (siNox4 vs siNC#1 as a control). White bar marks 1cm in length. Representative images from N = 3 independent collagen contraction experiments. Error bar = SD of 3 separate samples. (D) Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of Nox4 in fibroblasts. Representative images from 3 independent experiments. (E) Nox4 knockdown in RMF-HGF down-regulates mRNA expression of myofibroblast markers. Real time PCR analysis of siRNA transfected RMF-HGF. Error bar = SD of 3 separate experiments.Figure 4B shows that when compared to RMF, HGF-overexpressing fibroblasts showed a significant increase in collagen contraction, indicating a more activated and aggressive phenotype of the RMF-HGF. In the presence of a Nox inhibitor DPI, RMF-HGF showed an attenuated ability to contract collagen. This suggests that ROS-generating Nox enzymes contribute to fibroblast activation. Since DPI targets the activity of all Noxs, we specifically inhibited Nox4 expression in RMF-HGF using an siRNA and observed that down-regulation of Nox4 also significantly impaired the ability of RMF-HGF to contract collagen (Figure 4C). Protein expression levels of Nox4 in these fibroblasts were verified using western blot analysis as shown in Figure 4D. In addition to collagen gel contraction, we also evaluated the mRNA expression levels of some myofibroblast markers in Nox4-knocked down fibroblasts. Figure 4E shows that transfection with siNox4 down-regulated expression of stroma derived factor 1 (SDF1), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRa) in RMF-HGF when compared to the control siNC#1 transfected cells. Together, this study indicates that Nox4 up-regulation in RMF-HGF promotes an activated phenotype of the fibroblasts.Scavenging ROS with an SOD mimetic inhibited HGF-mediated growth and invasion of breast cancer cellsTo further provide evidence that ROS contributes to HGF-mediated oncogenic stimulation, we treated breast cancer cells with an SOD mimetic, MnTE-2-PyP (MnTE). This compound has been demonstrated to effectively scavenge ROS. We first stimulated 3D growth of MDA-MB231 with rHGF and observed that MnTE treatment inhibited the induction of breast cancer cell growth and stellate formation by HGF (Figure 5A). Next, we co-cultured breast cancer cells with RMF-HGF. In this co-culture, MnTE also greatly reduced the 3D colony sizes and invasive stellate formation of MDA-MB231 as seen in Figure 5B. Moreover, this inhibitory effect of MnTE is observed when cancer cells were stimulated with conditioned media harvested from RMF-HGF (Figure 5C). Cellular growth in conditioned media (shown in Figure 5C) was quantified using a luciferase activity assay and presented in Figure 5D. The antioxidant, MnTE inhibited HGF-mediated growth of breast cancer cells by 76% (P = 0.017). In addition to the 3D growth behavior, we also determined the effects of scavenging ROS with MnTE on HGF-mediated invasion of breast cancer cells. Figure 5E shows that while conditioned media from RMF-HGF promoted invasion of MDA-MB231, this stimulation was significantly reduced in the presence of MnTE. These studies reveal that HGF-mediated cancer cell-fibroblast interactions involve ROS and that administration of antioxidants can suppress the oncogenic HGF/c-Met signaling.Scavenging ROS with an SOD mimetic inhibited HGF-mediated 3D growth and Matrigel invasion of MDA-MB231Growth of MDA-MB231 cells was stimulated with either rHGF (50 ng/mL, A) or in co-culture with RMF-HGF (B), or with conditioned media (CM) harvested from fibroblasts (C). Cells were treated with an ROS scavenger, MnTE-2-PyP (MnTE, 15 uM) for 4 days. Representative bright field images of N = 3. Quantitation of the proliferation of MDA-MB231 in (C) is shown in (D). After 4 days of culture with conditioned media from RMF or RMF-HGF, MDA-MB231 cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured. (E) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded into Matrigel\u00ae invasion chamber and their ability to invade into conditioned media harvested from RMF or RMF-HGF in the present and absence of MnTE (15 uM) was analyzed. N = 3 independent studies. Data are mean \u00b1 SD of 3 separate samples. RLU = Relative light units.EcSOD inhibited HGF-mediated tumor growthTo determine the regulation of HGF-stimulated tumorigenesis by ROS, we utilized an orthotopic mammary tumor model. RMF-HGF was co-injected with the cancer cells as the source of c-Met ligand as well as in providing a model for studying the tumor-fibroblast interactions. The top panel of Figure 6A shows the presence of the breast cancer cells following the mammary fat pad injection. After 6 weeks post injection, RMF-HGF greatly stimulated the primary tumor growth of MDA-MB231, as expected (bottom panel). In contrast, EcSOD overexpressing cells (Ec.20) were irresponsive to the growth stimulation by RMF-HGF. Quantitation of the primary tumor growth is presented in Figure 6B as determined by photon flux over time.EcSOD suppresses HGF-stimulated tumor growth(A) Bioluminescence imaging showing tumor growth of luciferase expressing breast cancer cell lines in athymic nude mice. At Day 0, 106 MDA-MB231 or Ec.20 cells were co-injected with 3 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts (RMF or RMF-HGF) into both sides of the 4th mammary fad pads. Mice were imaged over time to monitor tumor growth as shown in representative images in (A) and the quantitation of the primary tumor growth is shown in (B).

Differential expression analysis of breast carcinomas versus normal tissues showed that EcSOD (or SOD3) is significantly down-regulated in different types of breast carcinomas in two main datasets, TCGA and Curtis Breast (Figure 7A). Specifically, in invasive breast carcinomas, SOD3 is ranked in the top 1% and 6% most significantly under-expressed genes as shown in the box plots in Figure 7B. The fold change of this gene is \u22125.475 in the TCGA and \u22122.654 in the Curtis datasets.Oncomine SOD3 (EcSOD) gene analysis in breast cancer(A) Comparison of SOD3 expression across 14 breast cancer analyses.

Since breast cancer cells primarily rely on their stroma fibroblasts for the c-Met ligand, understanding the contributing factors that fuel this reciprocal communication between cancer cells and their stroma partners will therefore, help in identifying novel targets for c-Met driven cancer. In this study, we identified c-Met as one of the RTKs regulated by an extracellular antioxidant enzyme, EcSOD in basal-like breast cancer cells via modulating the cellular redox status. Expression of this enzyme has been shown to be suppressed in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer. Conversely, up-regulation of EcSOD has been reported to inhibit both in vitro and in vivo growth as well as the oncogenic phenotype of breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreas cancer, melanomas, and lung cancer, suggesting tumor suppressive effects of this antioxidant.The oncogenic RTK, c-Met is one of the cell surface receptors known to be activated by ROS. Stimulation of lung cancer cells with exogenous ROS (i.e. H2O2) enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met and activated its downstream signaling cascades in lung cancer cells. In these same cells, an increase in ROS production was also observed when c-Met was activated by HGF treatment. In addition, ROS-induced invasive activity of hepatoma cells has been demonstrated to be mediated through an autocrine/paracrine loop of HGF, where ROS directly augment mRNA expression of HGF. Our study provides further evidence that a pro-oxidative environment is involved in activating and sustaining the oncogenic HGF/c-Met signaling and that re-expressing EcSOD in breast cancer cells inhibits HGF-stimulated oncogenesis. Further supporting an association of c-Met signaling with loss of EcSOD expression, a gene expression profiling study identified EcSOD as one of the genes that was down-regulated in both c-Met driven mouse liver tumors and human hepatocyte carcinomas, and that this change has a significant predictive power on overall and disease-free survival.Although the second messenger role of ROS in cellular signaling is well recognized, it is not clear how EcSOD specifically regulates c-Met signaling amongst the other kinases screened in this study. Interestingly, phosphorylation of other RTKs such as EGFR, ERBB2, and FLT-3 have recently been shown to be promoted when EcSOD is overexpressed in thyroid cancer cells. Despite increased phosphorylation of these RTKs, EcSOD overexpressing cells showed a reduced level of growth and migration signal transductions, through down-regulation of small GTPase regulatory genes. The same study also showed a reduction of HGFR (or c-Met) phosphorylation in EcSOD enriched cells. The discrepancies between our RTK findings with the exception of c-Met phosphorylation could be due to specificity issues related to the cell type examined and possibly also influenced by the dose-dependent effect of this ROS scavenger, as suggested by the authors.One mechanism by which EcSOD could inhibit c-Met signaling is by reducing bioavailability of its ligand HGF, via TSPs, as shown by our extracellular protein array analysis. Thrombospondin 1,TSP-1 is a well known anti-angiogenic protein that elicits a variety of cellular processes, including a recently discovered role in maintaining dormancy of disseminated tumor cells. The TSP-1 interactome is still not fully defined but HGF has been identified to be one of its ligands. We have shown here for the first time that EcSOD expressing cells secrete higher levels of TSP-1 and TSP-2 (Figure 1D). Not only is the function of HGF affected by TSP-1, the expression of this anti-angiogenic factor has also been shown to be down-regulated by HGF-c-Met interactions in breast cancer cells, indicating a negative regulatory circuit of TSP1 and HGF. Further supporting a regulatory effect of EcSOD on TSP-1, a microarray expression analysis has identified TSP-1 as one of the growth suppressors upregulated by this antioxidant in thyroid cancer cells.It is now well recognized that the progression from normal to benign, malignant, and metastatic, as well as therapeutic resistance is driven not just by what is happening inside the cancer cell but by reciprocal communication between the cancer cells and their stroma microenvironment. Our heterotypic co-culture studies indicate an ROS-mediated reciprocal interaction between cancer cells and fibroblasts (Figure 2). After a prolonged co-cultivation with CAF-like RMF-HGF, breast cancer cells showed a heightened aggressiveness in invasive properties and they also pre-educated RMF-HGF to increase their ability to promote breast cancer invasion. This symbiotic relationship is compromised when breast cancer cell overexpress EcSOD. The presence of EcSOD in breast cancer cells not only inhibited this RMF-HGF-stimulated invasion, but on top of that prevented the reprograming of RMF-HGF in their tumor-promoting phenotype. This suggests that an oxidative microenvironment is a contributing factor in regulating HGF-c-Met-mediated tumor stroma co-evolution. This is particularly important considering the fact that 86% of the aggressive basal-like tumors are positively correlated with the HGF signature. Furthermore, among basal-like patients that are positive for the HGF signature, patients had worse overall survival. While some c-Met signaling can arise from an autocrine manner, the predominant activation mode of c-Met in breast cancer is through a paracrine tumor-stroma interactions. Immunohistochemistry analysis shows that the HGF/c-Met paracrine pattern is seen in 59.1% of tumors; and that this paracrine signaling is associated with a worse outcome when c-Met staining is more intense at the tumor front.Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) actively participate in the outcome of breast cancer by providing extracellular matrix components and secreting signaling factors that enhance cancer cell growth, survival, oncogenic progression, and metastasis. However, the intrinsic factor(s) contributing to the \u201cactivated\u201d fibroblast phenotype of CAFs remains to be elucidated. A recent study showed that oxidative stress is necessary for triggering fibroblast activation in the pathological condition of fibrosis. NADPH oxidases (Noxs) are the predominant enzymes that produce O2\u2022\u2212 on the plasma (and organelle) membrane and their activation has been linked to the etiology of cancer. Importantly, Nox4 is the only Nox that is expressed as an active enzyme. Thus, elevated Nox4 will lead to an increase in ROS generation. Nox4 has been suggested to play an important role in inducing fibroblast activation during fibrosis in cardiac and pulmonary fibroblasts and in TGF\u03b2-induced myofibroblast activation, but the role of Nox4 in CAFs is not known. Here we have shown that the HGF-induced activated phenotype of mammary fibroblasts involves Nox4-generated ROS (Figures 3 and 4). This explains the suppressive effects of EcSOD during co-cultivation of breast cancer cells with RMF-HGF as well as in our in vivo tumor model. Modulating the redox tumor microenvironment will therefore, not only inhibit the oncogenic c-Met pathway in cancer cells, but also target the activated phenotype of CAFs, thus suppressing their tumor-stroma interactions.Despite the name implying that EcSOD is an extracellular antioxidant, the O2\u2022- scavenging effect of this enzyme is not limited to the cell surface and the secreted compartment but also more widely distributed to endocytic vehicles and nucleus. By harboring a heparin binding domain at its c-terminus, EcSOD interacts with cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans once it is secreted. This interaction has been shown to be critical for the re-entry of this enzyme through a clathrine-mediated endocytosis and its nuclear translocation. This feature renders EcSOD more readily available to cells or tissues that do not express this enzyme and internalization of exogenous EcSOD has been reported in mouse preadipocytes and endothelial cells. Here, the secreted EcSOD from Ec.20 cancer cells is also likely to be taken up by the co-cultured RMF-HGF, resulting in a decrease in O2\u2022\u2212 levels of the fibroblasts (Figure 3H), thereby attenuating the tumor-promoting effects of RMF-HGF, as seen in Figure 2.Although Nox4 has been historically considered as a O2\u2022\u2212 generating enzyme, an increasing number of studies have reported that the major product of Nox4 is H2O2, although other studies have detected O2\u2022\u2212 generation. It is plausible that some of the discrepancies may have resulted from non-specificity issues of the ROS detection reagents or that the O2\u2022\u2212 produced (in membrane compartments) remains cryptic and inaccessible to assay reagents prior to its dismutation to form H2O2. Since the oxygen-reducing heme group at the catalytic site of Nox4 is an obligate one-electron donor, a direct formation of H2O2 without a O2\u2022\u2212 intermediate is mechanistically implausible, implying that Nox4 is both a O2\u2022\u2212 and H2O2 producer. This is supported by a recent study using cell-free isolated Nox4, where the authors found that approximately 80% of the product from the isolated Nox4 was detected as H2O2, while ~20% was detected as O2\u2022\u2212.Since EcSOD catalyzes the dismutation of O2\u2022\u2212 to H2O2, some may argue that EcSOD would exacerbate the H2O2 levels in Nox4-overexpressing RMF-HGF, and if so overexpression of EcSOD would not have inhibited but promoted c-Met signaling, since this RTK is known to be activated by H2O2. Whether overexpression of SOD can increase the production of H2O2 has been a hotly debated issue. Although some studies have attributed the consequences of SOD overexpression to this counter intuitive effect in increasing H2O2 levels, the view that SOD should elevate H2O2 formation merely because it catalyzes an H2O2-producing reaction has been disputed. Liochev and Fridovich reasoned that an excess of SOD should decrease the steady-state levels of O2\u2022\u2212 without increasing the endogenous formation of H2O2, particularly in vivo. Therefore, it is doubtful that the inhibitory tumor-stroma effects seen with EcSOD overexpression in our current study, is due to an overproduction of H2O2. Moreover, the copper ion located in the catalytic domain of EcSOD are sensitive to H2O2 attack and by acting in a \u201csuicidal mode\u201d, EcSOD can have peroxidase-like properties. Our data showing a decrease in both cellular O2\u2022\u2212 levels and the extracellular H2O2 levels in the co-cultures (Figure 3H and 3I) support the view that overexpression of this extracellular O2\u2022\u2212 scavenger does not contribute to H2O2 accumulation, but reduces cellular oxidative stress.Although H2O2 has long been the main focus as the ROS-mediated signaling molecule, partly due to it being a more stable and longer lived species than O2\u2022\u2212 , O2\u2022\u2212 has recently been viewed as an important mediator of cellular effects. Superoxide affects both serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), by oxidizing the metal ion center of the former class of phosphatases and via nucleophilic attack of the cysteine residue in the later class. The rate of O2\u2022\u2212 signaling has been estimated to be about 10\u2013100 times higher than that of H2O2 signaling in inactivating PTP-1B. In addition to being kinetically more efficient, O2\u2022\u2212 is chemically more specific than H2O2 in this process as the catalytic site of PTP-1B is surrounded by positively charged residues. This provides an efficient fine-tuning ability of O2\u2022\u2212 in regulating signal transduction. PTP1B is known to play a distinct and non-redundant role as a negative regulator of c-Met. Therefore, re-expression of EcSOD, by scavenging O2\u2022\u2212 and blocking superoxide-mediated PTP1B inactivation, provides an inhibitory regulation of oncogenic signal transduction such as the c-Met pathway.In comparison to the other two intracellular SODs, EcSOD is the new comer in terms of its tumor suppressive role in cancer and the mechanisms involved are less well understood. The degree of differential expression of this antioxidant in cancer versus normal cells/tissues however, is more pronounced and prevalent than the other SODs in breast cancer. Oncomine gene expression signature analysis identifies EcSOD as one of the top 1% to 6% under-expressed genes in invasive ductal breast carcinomas versus normal tissues from both the TCGA and Curtis datasets (Figure 7). Down-regulation of EcSOD expression in cancer cells has been associated with epigenetic silencing, up-regulation of oncomir microRNA-21, Ras oncogene-mediated gene silencing, chronic estrogen-induced gene suppression, single nucleotide polymorphisms, DNA copy number variation, and loss of heterozygosity as reviewed recently. All of these observations imply that deregulation of EcSOD expression, distribution, or function provides a selective advantage in cancer cells. Furthermore, association of low EcSOD expression levels with poor relapse-free survival as shown in Table 1 underscores the importance of EcSOD as a potential tumor suppressor gene, inhibiting the progression of malignant phenotype in human breast cancer. However, the mechanisms of how EcSOD loss could promote oncogenesis is not fully understood.CONCLUSIONSTaken together, our study shows that ROS contributes to HGF-stimulated c-Met activation and that overexpressing the extracellular antioxidant enzyme, EcSOD suppresses this oncogenic cancer-fibroblast interaction. Modulating the redox tumor microenvironment not only inhibits the oncogenic c-Met pathway in cancer cells but also targets the redox-mediated activated phenotype of CAFs. ROS as merely a damaging bystander species that induce cytotoxic effects does not provide a complete picture of their biological effects. Rather, they should be considered as critical players in fine-tuning cellular signaling events in a temporal and purposeful manner in cancer. Future studies to unravel the specific modifications of signaling molecules/factors by O2\u2022\u2212 and H2O2 and how EcSOD regulates oncogenic signal transduction pathways will help to identify specific redox-mediators as potential cancer targets.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines, growth conditions, and reagentsHuman mammary epithelial cell line, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). A firefly luciferase expressing stable cell line, MDA-MB231.luc, was previously generated as described. Stable EcSOD overexpressing MDA-MB231 cell line, Ec.20 were generated as previously described. Reduction mammoplasty fibroblasts expressing human HGF (RMF-HGF) and their parental normal fibroblasts (RMF) were generated by Dr Charlotte Kuperwasser (Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA). MDA-MB231 were maintained in RPMI1640 (or DMEM when co-cultured with fibroblasts) containing 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep. MDA-MB468 and RMF and RMF-HGF fibroblasts were grown in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum media and 1X Pen/Strep. All cells are maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% O2.Antibodies: anti-total cMet (Cell Signaling cat # 4560), anti-phopho c-Met at Y1235/1235 (Cell Signaling, Cat # s25728).

Briefly, 4-chamber slides were coated with 150 uL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Two-dimensional cultured cells were trypsinized and suspended single cells were then overlaid on the Matrigel at 2 \u00d7 104 cells per chamber. Culture media was replaces every 2 days as described. Protocol was also adapted to the \u03bc-Slide angiogenesis with ibiTreat (#81506, iBidi USA, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA) using 10 uL of Matrigel and overlaying 2.5 \u00d7 103 cells per well.Co-cultureFibroblasts were embedded in 200 uL of Matrigel at 4 \u00d7 104 cells per chamber of the 4-chamber slide. Once solidified, 2 \u00d7 104 breast cancer cells were seeded on top of the matrix in 3D culture media. In co-culture model using conditioned media, breast cancer cells were seeded n Matrigel as described above except that the 3D culture media was replaced by conditioned media harvested from fibroblasts.Prolong co-culture of cancer cells with fibroblastsFibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were grown in the bottom of a 6-well plate and 1 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB231 cells were seeded on the 0.4 uM polyester membrane of a transwell insert (BD Bioscience). Cells were co-cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum media and 1X Pen/Strep. After 48 h of co-culture, these two cell types were trypsinized, counted and seeded in subsequent co-cultures for a total of 4 passages.Cell lysate preparation and western blot analysisCell lysates preparation and western blot analysis was performed as previously described. Antibody dilutions were as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-human EcSOD, 1/5000; rabbit anti-human b-actin, 1/2000; anti-phospho c-Met, 1/1000; anti-total c-Met, 1/1000; anti-Nox4, 1/1000; anti-phospho p44/42, 1/1000; anti-total p44/42, 1/5000; goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, 1/50000; and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP, 1/10000. Densitometry analysis of the signal intensity was performed using ImageJ software (NIH).RT\u2013PCRTotal RNA was isolated using Quick RNA Miniprep (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Followed by reverse transcription using a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using Maxima SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific #K0221) on a ABI 7000 Fast machine. The fold change was calculated using the 2^(-ddCt) method using 18S as the reference gene. Primer sequences are as follows:Nox4 (Forward 5\u2032-AAC ACC TCT GCC TGT TCA TC-3,\u2019Reverse 5\u2032-GAT ACT CTG GCC CTT GGT TAT AC-3\u2032); HGF (Forward 5\u2032-ATG TCA GCG TTG GGA TTC TC-3\u2032; Reverse 5\u2032-TCG GAT GTT TGG ATC AGT GG-3\u2032); CYBA (Forward 5\u2032-CGT CCT GCA TCT CCT GCT-3\u2032, Reverse 5\u2032-GTA GAT GCC GCT CGC AAT-3\u2032); 18S (Forward 5\u2032-CCT TGG ATG TGG TAG CCG TTT-3\u2032, Reverse 5\u2032-AAC TTT CGA TGG TAG TCG CCG-3\u2032); SDF-1 (Forward 5\u2032-GAC CCA ACG TCA AGC ATC TC, Reverse 5\u2032-CGG GTC AAT GCA CAC TTG TC); SMA (Forward 5\u2032-GCG TGG CTA TTC CTT CGT TA, Reverse 5\u2032-TCA GGC AAC TCG TAA CTC TTC TC); PDGFRa (Forward 5\u2032-TGC CTG ACA TTG ACC CTG T, Reverse 5\u2032-CCG TCT CAA TGG CAC TCT CT); FAP (Forward 5\u2032-TGT TTC GGT CCT GTC TAT ATG TG, Reverse 5\u2032-CCC ATC CAG TTC TGC TTT CT).Generation of catalytically inactive mutant EcSODThe doxycycline-inducible catalytically inactive mutant EcSOD expressing MDA-MB231 (iMutEcSOD) were generated using the Lenti-X Tet-On 3G Inducible Expression System (Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, this is a two-vector system. One vector expresses a doxycycline-sensing transactivator protein, while the other vector expresses the gene-of-interest in a dox-inducible manner. First, the catalytically inactive mutant EcSOD (N180A, R186A) was mutated. The mutant EcSOD was cloned into the pLVX-TRE3G-IRES vector (Takara Bio USA) by In-Fusion Cloning Kit (#638909, Takara Bio USA) after addition of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends homologous to the vector. Lentiviral particles were generated followed by transduction of the transactivator and mutant EcSOD vector into MDA-MB231 cell line. The transduced cells were selected for double positive cells with puromycin (0.6 \u03bcg/mL) and G418 (1.2 mg/mL).ROS detection by DHE and CellRoxROS levels were measured using dihydoethidium (DHE) or CellROX Deep Red Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific #C10422). Briefly, fibroblasts were suspended and incubated in 10 \u03bcM DHE for 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C in the dark or 3 \u03bcM CellROX Deep Red for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C in the dark. The fluorescence was then read after excitation (405 nm for DHE and 633 nm for CellROX Deep Red) by flow cytometry using a BD LSRII.Amplex Red assayExtracellular H2O2 production was measured using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide Assay kit (#A22188, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RMF and RMF-HGF fibroblasts (1.8 \u00d7105 cells) were plated in a 12 well format for 48 hours. RMF-HGF cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a pan Nox and flavoprotein inhibitor. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in 1 mL of the Amplex Red reaction mixture consisting of 50 \u03bcM Amplex Red reagent and 0.1 U/mL HRP in HBSS +Ca2+/Mg2+. Every hour, 300 \u03bcL (3 \u00d7 100 \u03bcL) of the reaction mixture was removed from each sample and put into a 96 well plate. The fluorescence product indicative of the amount of H2O2 produced was measured using a Tecan infinite M200 pro plate reader at excitation of 560 nm and emission of 590 nm.Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR)Superoxide levels were measured using 1-hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine (CMH). CMH (200 \u03bcM) was prepared in Krebs-Hepes Buffer (KHB) with deferoxamine (DF) and diethyldithiocarbamic acid sodium salt (DETC). After washing with KHB +DF/DETC, cells were incubated in CMH for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Cells were scraped and resuspended before measuring the EPR signal. The EPR signal was measured using a Bruker E-Scan Table Top EPR spectrometer.Glutathione assayTotal and oxidized glutathione (GSH) levels were measured using the GSH/GSSG-Glo kit (#V6611, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, this assay produces luminescence by coupling glutathione S-transferase with luciferase to produce light in a GSH-dependent manner. Cells were plated and lysed in 96 well white plate to measure total GSH levels (10,000 cells/well) or oxidized glutathione (20,000 cells/well).RTK arrayCell lysates were quantified by Bradford assay (Protein Assay, Bio-Rad, USA) and incubated with the PathScan RTK signaling kit array chip (#7949, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, after incubation of the samples, biotin-labeled anti-pan-phospho-tyrosine antibodies and specific anti-phospho-residue antibodies were used to detect phosphorylated proteins captured on each spot on the nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with DyLight 680-linked streptavidin, the chip was washed, fully dried and imaged using a Li-COR Odyssey imager. The pixel density of the background was subtracted from the pixel density of each spot, and the average of duplicate spots was determined. Next, Signal intensity was calculated by the normalization of mean pixel density in each spot against the pixel density of the positive control.Collagen contraction assayHuman mammary fibroblasts were suspended (500,000 cells/mL) in a rat tail collagen I solution (2.2 mg/mL; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) as described. MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 1.8 mg/mL NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 2.3 mg/mL L-glutamine (Invitrogen) was used as a diluent and pH was adjusted with 0.22 M NaOH. For each replicate, 500 \u03bcL cell-collagen mixture was dispensed into a single well of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to facilitate collagen polymerization. Next, the collagen gels were detached from the well using a pipet tip. Culture media (500 \u03bcL) was then added and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO2\u2013containing atmosphere. Images of the collagen matrix were taken at the end of contraction time point, and surface area was measured with ImageJ software (NIH).Adenovirus transductionOverexpression of EcSOD and Nox4 was achieved by adenovirus infection, as previously described with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 for 48 h in MDA-MB231 cells. Overexpression in MDA-MB468 was achieved using a MOI of 5. Both AdEcSOD and AdNox4 were purchased from University of Iowa Vector Core Facility.siRNA transfectionSiRNA transfection was performed using 10 nM siRNA with the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific #13778030) following the manufacturers protocol. The siNC#1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific #4390843) and the siNox4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific #4392420; ID#s224159) were purchased from (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).Invasion assayThe in vitro invasive properties of the breast cancer cells were performed using the BD Bio-Coat Matrigel invasion assay system (BD Biosciences) as previously described. Briefly, 2 \u00d7 105 cancer cells in serum free media were seeded into the Matrigel inserts consisting with 8-um filter pores. After 16 h of incubation, the upper surface of the transwell chambers was removed with a cotton swab and cells that have invaded through the Matrigel were lysed with the Luc-Screen Extended-Glow Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay System kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # T1033) and analyzed for luciferase activity using the Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader. In some experiments, invaded cells were counted after being fixed and stained using a crystal violet solution (2% crystal violet, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid).In vivo tumor studyEight-week-old female athymic nude mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories Inc. (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The nude mice protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Iowa. Breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231.luc or Ec.20 at 1 \u00d7 106) were injected alone or co-injected with 3 \u00d7 105 mammary fibroblasts (RMF or RMF-HGF) into both sides of the 4th mammary fad pads, in the presence of 50% Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored weekly by bioluminescence imaging as previously described.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using SYSTAT. For some experiments, a single-factor ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey test was used to determine statistical differences between means. Statistical analyses were assessed using a two-tailed Student's t test. Results shown are representative of at least three separate experiments each performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was achieved when P < 0.05.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.FUNDINGThis work was financially supported by grants from the NIH R01 CA115438 (FE Domann), NIH R0I-CA182086A (Teoh-Fitzgerald), Redox Biology Pilot Project Fund (NTSBRDF, Uni. of Nebraska, Lincoln) (Teoh-Fitzgerald), and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services Award LB506 (Teoh-Fitzgerald).
