    "## Potential Rules for Nampt in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules for Nampt in CAFs, based on the provided research papers, formatted as requested: **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases proliferation. **Justification:** NAMPT is often overexpressed in tumor tissues and is associated with poorer prognosis. [Document 5] NAMPT is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the generation of the PARP substrate \u03b2-NAD+, and the suppression of \u03b2-NAD+ levels by NAMPT inhibition most likely explains these observations. [Document 4] NAMPT promotes the proliferation and survival of rapidly dividing cancer cells by elevating NAD levels and enhancing glycolysis. [Document 10] **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases \u03b1-SMA expression. **Justification:** NAMPT overexpression has been observed in multiple malignant tumors, including breast, ovarian, thyroid, gastric, prostate and colorectal cancers, gliomas, and malignant lymphomas. [Document 10] NAMPT promotes the proliferation and survival of rapidly dividing cancer cells by elevating NAD levels and enhancing glycolysis. [Document 10] CAFs are characterized by the high expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1). [Document 2] **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases secretion of inflammatory factors. **Justification:** Inhibition of NAMPT by FK866 in CAFs decreases the expression of activity indicators (\u03b1-SMA, PDGFR\u03b2), stemness indicators (BMI-1, OCT4), inflammatory factors and chemokines. [Document 5] **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases secretion of chemokines. **Justification:** Inhibition of NAMPT by FK866 in CAFs decreases the expression of activity indicators (\u03b1-SMA, PDGFR\u03b2), stemness indicators (BMI-1, OCT4), inflammatory factors and chemokines. [Document 5] **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases the expression of stemness markers. **Justification:** Inhibition of NAMPT by FK866 in CAFs decreases the expression of activity indicators (\u03b1-SMA, PDGFR\u03b2), stemness indicators (BMI-1, OCT4), inflammatory factors and chemokines. [Document 5] **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases the expression of PDGFR\u03b2. **Justification:** Inhibition of NAMPT by FK866 in CAFs decreases the expression of activity indicators (\u03b1-SMA, PDGFR\u03b2), stemness indicators (BMI-1, OCT4), inflammatory factors and chemokines. [Document 5] **Rule 7:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases the expression of PITX3. **Justification:** High-throughput sequencing reveals that PITX3 are down-regulated after NAD+ reduction in CAFs, which could be reversed by adding NAM, a raw material for NAD+ synthesis. [Document 5] **Rule 8:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases the expression of TGF-\u03b2. **Justification:** NAMPT has been found to induce breast cancer cell proliferation through the AKT/PI3K and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, and to protect against apoptosis. [Document 10] TGF-\u03b2 ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression. [Document 11] **Rule 9:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases the expression of BRCA1. **Justification:** NAMPT has been found to induce breast cancer cell proliferation through the AKT/PI3K and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, and to protect against apoptosis. [Document 10] Low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. [Document 7] **Rule 10:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nampt increases the expression of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin. **Justification:** CAFs are characterized by the high expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1). [Document 2] CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and CAFs autophagy can induce TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. [Document 2] **Note:** These rules are based on the information provided in the research papers and may not be exhaustive. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Nampt in CAFs and its impact on TNBC progression. "
