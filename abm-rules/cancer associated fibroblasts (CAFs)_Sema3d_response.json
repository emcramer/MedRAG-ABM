    "## Potential Rules for Sema3d in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d decreases migration speed. **Justification:** Sema3d has been shown to inhibit cell motility in various cell types, including breast carcinoma cells [6, 46]. This suggests that Sema3d could also have an inhibitory effect on CAF migration. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d increases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 (pFAK397). **Justification:** Sema3A (a closely related semaphorin) has been shown to stimulate FAK phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons [46]. This suggests that Sema3d could also increase pFAK397 levels in CAFs. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d increases \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to increase \u03b1-SMA expression in fibroblasts [46]. This suggests that Sema3d could also increase \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d decreases collagen secretion. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to inhibit collagen deposition in breast cancer cells [8]. This suggests that Sema3d could also decrease collagen secretion in CAFs. **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d decreases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in various cell types [46]. This suggests that Sema3d could also decrease the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CAFs. **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d decreases the expression of genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to inhibit EMT in breast cancer cells [46]. This suggests that Sema3d could also decrease the expression of EMT-related genes in CAFs. **Rule 7:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Sema3d decreases the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis. **Justification:** Sema3A has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in various cell types [46]. This suggests that Sema3d could also decrease the expression of angiogenesis-related genes in CAFs. **Note:** These rules are based on the available information in the provided documents and may not be exhaustive. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Sema3d in CAFs and its potential therapeutic implications. "
