    "## Potential Rules for ITGAV_ITGB1 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Integrins are essential for cell adhesion and migration. ITGAV_ITGB1 is a collagen-binding integrin that is upregulated during myofibroblast differentiation and is involved in collagen organization and tumor stiffness. [Document 11] This suggests that ITGAV_ITGB1 could play a role in promoting CAF migration. **Rule 2:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Integrins are known to play a role in cell activation. ITGAV_ITGB1 is upregulated during myofibroblast differentiation, which is a process of fibroblast activation. [Document 11] This suggests that ITGAV_ITGB1 could promote the transition of CAFs to an activated state. **Rule 3:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases collagen secretion. **Justification:** Integrins are involved in ECM remodeling. ITGAV_ITGB1 is a collagen-binding integrin and is involved in collagen organization. [Document 11] This suggests that ITGAV_ITGB1 could promote collagen secretion by CAFs. **Rule 4:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases transform to mesenchymal. **Justification:** Integrins are involved in EMT. ITGAV_ITGB1 is upregulated during myofibroblast differentiation, which is a process that can be associated with EMT. [Document 11] This suggests that ITGAV_ITGB1 could promote the transition of CAFs to a mesenchymal phenotype. **Rule 5:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases transform to M2. **Justification:** Integrins are involved in macrophage polarization. ITGAV_ITGB1 is upregulated during myofibroblast differentiation, and myofibroblasts are known to promote M2 macrophage polarization. [Document 12] This suggests that ITGAV_ITGB1 could promote the transition of CAFs to an M2 phenotype. **Rule 6:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can become activated upon encountering cancer cells, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. [Document 3] This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of cancer cells present in the tumor model. **Rule 7:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases transform to mesenchymal from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the role of fibroblasts in promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells, which is often associated with increased invasion and metastasis. [Document 3] This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of fibroblasts present in the tumor model. **Rule 8:** In CAFs, ITGAV_ITGB1 increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that macrophages can be re-educated towards the M1 phenotype upon encountering dead cells. This can lead to increased tumor cell killing. [Document 3] This rule can be adjusted based on the specific types and levels of inflammatory signals present in the tumor model. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific research question and the specific tumor model you are using. "
