Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. ***p \u2264 0.001 using \u0394Ct valuesTo evaluate the effect of COX-2 expression on structural ECM changes, we characterized Col1 fiber distribution in 1 mm-thick fresh tumor slices using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are key players in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we characterize four CAF subsets in breast cancer with distinct properties and levels of activation. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a multi-step mechanism. By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4<sup+</supCD25<sup+</sup T lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and\u00a0JAM2. Moreover, CAF-S1 increases T lymphocyte survival and promotes their differentiation into CD25<supHigh</supFOXP3<supHigh</sup, through B7H3, CD73, and DPP4. Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T\u00a0cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation. These data are consistent with FOXP3+ T lymphocyte accumulation in CAF-S1-enriched TNBC and show how a CAF subset contributes to immunosuppression.",

        "title": "Deciphering the temporal heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations in breast cancer.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel).

Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients.

Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to impact on tumour behaviour, but the mechanisms controlling this are poorly understood. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were isolated from cancers by laser microdissection or were cultured. Fibroblasts were transfected to manipulate miR-222 or Lamin B receptor (LBR). The fibroblast-conditioned medium was collected and used to treat epithelial BC lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157. Migration, invasion, proliferation or senescence was assessed using transwell, MTT or X-gal assays, respectively. MiR-222 was upregulated in CAFs as compared with NFs. Ectopic miR-222 expression in NFs induced CAF-like expression profiles, while miR-222 knockdown in CAFs inhibited CAF phenotypes. LBR was identified as a direct miR-222 target, and was functionally relevant since LBR knockdown phenocopied miR-222 overexpression and LBR overexpression phenocopied miR-222 knockdown. MiR-222 overexpression, or LBR knockdown, was sufficient to induce NFs to show the CAF characteristics of enhanced migration, invasion and senescence, and furthermore, the conditioned medium from these fibroblasts induced increased BC cell migration and invasion. The reverse manipulations in CAFs inhibited these behaviours in fibroblasts, and inhibited paracrine influences on BC cells.

Fibroblasts were transfected to manipulate miR-222 or Lamin B receptor (LBR). The fibroblast-conditioned medium was collected and used to treat epithelial BC lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157. Migration, invasion, proliferation or senescence was assessed using transwell, MTT or X-gal assays, respectively.ResultsMiR-222 was upregulated in CAFs as compared with NFs. Ectopic miR-222 expression in NFs induced CAF-like expression profiles, while miR-222 knockdown in CAFs inhibited CAF phenotypes. LBR was identified as a direct miR-222 target, and was functionally relevant since LBR knockdown phenocopied miR-222 overexpression and LBR overexpression phenocopied miR-222 knockdown. MiR-222 overexpression, or LBR knockdown, was sufficient to induce NFs to show the CAF characteristics of enhanced migration, invasion and senescence, and furthermore, the conditioned medium from these fibroblasts induced increased BC cell migration and invasion. The reverse manipulations in CAFs inhibited these behaviours in fibroblasts, and inhibited paracrine influences on BC cells.ConclusionMiR-222/LBR have key roles in controlling pro-progression influences of CAFs in BC. This pathway may present therapeutic opportunities to inhibit CAF-induced cancer progression.BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide among women, and nearly 2.3 million females are newly diagnosed annually. Although there are initial responses to treatment, many cancers relapse and distant metastases occur in nearly one-third of woman; these are typically fatal. The biology behind BC metastases still remains undetermined. Therefore, understanding molecular determinants of metastasis is crucial for finding new therapeutic strategies. The tumour microenvironment consists of immune cells, blood vessels, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. This microenvironment plays key roles in disease outcome by inducing tumour cell proliferation and aggressiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an activated form of tissue-resident fibroblasts present within breast cancers, comprise a major component of the tumour microenvironment, characterised most commonly by expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. CAFs can induce cancer progression and metastasis by secreting various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (e.g., VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12, IL6 and IL8) and by modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) that facilitates tumour cell migration and invasion. CAFs also modulate immune cell function to create an immune-suppressive environment during cancer progression. The process of transformation of CAFs from resident normal fibroblasts is achieved by several growth factors, however, the mechanisms of transformation have not yet been fully explored and may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention; interestingly, once transformed into CAFs, the CAF phenotype has been regarded as stable, probably though maintenance of epigenetic changes.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3\u2032untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target genes, leading to post-transcriptional downregulation. MiRNAs can be oncogenic or act as tumour suppressors, depending upon the specific genes that they regulate. Dysregulation of miRNAs within the fibroblast component of breast cancer has been reported, and is therefore implicated in induction or maintenance of the CAF phenotype. For example, differential expression between breast CAFs and normal fibroblasts has been reported for many miRNAs, including miR-221, miR-31, miR-205, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-107, miR-30b, the let-7 family and miR-26b, although there is relatively little consistency between reports. Far fewer miRNAs have been shown experimentally to have functional impacts on the breast CAF phenotype, or most interestingly indirectly on cancer cell behaviour; examples include miR-26b, let-7b, miR-200 family and miR-29b. Although some of these studies have indicated functional roles for specific miRNAs within CAFs, very few studies have directly investigated miRNA roles on the transformation and maintenance of CAF phenotypes and on how this impacts on cancer behaviour, therefore how miRNAs in CAFs are involved in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we have focussed on miR-222 as a candidate regulator of CAF phenotypes and cancer behaviour. MiR-222 has previously been reported as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including BC, functioning within the cancer cells themselves, as opposed to stromal cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that upregulation of miR-222 induced growth of cancer cells by targeting p27/kip1, as well as chemoresistance by targeting PTEN/Akt. Interestingly, in the context of our study on function in fibroblasts, levels of miR-222 positively correlated with fibroblast viability in hypertrophic scar tissues, while miR-222 has been shown to induce replicative senescence in human lung fibroblasts. However, to date, no studies have been published on roles of miR-222 in CAFs. Therefore, the above observations suggest the importance of miR-222 as a post-transcriptional modifier, playing functional roles in BC progression. However, it is unclear whether expression of miR-222 is only tumour cell specific or the other cells also express miR-222 in tumour microenvironment. As miR-222 is an important oncogenic factor in breast cancer, we wanted to unveil whether CAFs also expressed miR-222 to influence disease progression.Materials and methodsReagentsFoetal bovine serum (FBS), DMEM and antibiotic/antimycotic (100X; 10,000\u2009units/mL penicillin, 10,000\u2009\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 25\u2009\u00b5g/mL amphotericin B) were purchased from ThermoFisher (MA, USA).

Fresh samples of surgically removed breast cancer samples were minced, digested with collagenase IV from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai, India) and plated (collagenase I coated) to derive primary breast CAFs (from within tumour masses) and NFs (from\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm outside tumour margins). Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were obtained from the ATCC (VA, USA). The NF and CAF fibroblast lines were derived from breast cancer samples and immortalised using lentiviral transduction of hTERT, as previously described. All cell lines were cultured in the DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics in a humid atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. NFs were transfected with scrambled siRNA negative control (NC), siLBR, miR-222 mimic or mimic control using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher; MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Similarly, CAFs were transfected with scramble negative control, miR-222 inhibitor, pCDNA or pCDNA-LBR. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting, qRT-PCR analyses, senescence studies or migration/invasion studies. To collect NF and CAF conditioned medium, cells were seeded into six-well plates at 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well. As previously described, cells were transfected as appropriate for 24\u2009h, then medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. After 48 and 72\u2009h of incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 150\u2009g for 5\u2009min, and then the supernatant was collected.RNA isolation and qPCRMiR-222 is upregulated in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and controls breast fibroblast phenotype. a MiR-222 expression was determined by qPCR, and is shown for CAFs relative to NFs in three separate cell types. Left plot: matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs were isolated from breast cancer patient samples using laser microdissection of archival (fixed) tissue. The data represent technical triplicates. Middle plot: four matched pairs of primary cultured CAFs and NFs from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. The data represent technical triplicates. Right plot: immortalised breast CAF and NF cell lines. The data represent biological triplicates. b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and miR-222 expression was assessed using qPCR. Data represent biological triplicates. c Relative gene expression levels of the CAF markers, \u03b1-SMA, Fibroblast Specific Protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were assessed in immortalised CAFs as compared with immortalised NFs using qPCR. The data represent biological triplicates. d Relative expression levels of the same CAF markers were assessed using qPCR in NFs (left) or CAFs (right) transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC). The data represent biological triplicates. e NFs or CAFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and protein expression of the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA (ACTA2) and vimentin were assessed using Western blots, along with \u03b2-actin as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005For LMD samples, the total RNA was extracted from using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, or the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). RNA was reverse-transcribed for miR-222 using the TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and the resulting first strand was amplified using specific Taqman miRNA assay primers (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). The PCRs were performed by StepOne plus detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and amplification data were normalised using RNU6 expression. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. For cultured primary fibroblasts (in Fig.\u00a01b), RNA was isolated from a 90-mm dish of cultured cells using TRIzol (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction and RNA quantified by MULTISCANGO (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). For miRNA expression status and gene expression status, first strand cDNA and cDNA were synthesised with miScript RT-II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Superscript III (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), respectively. MiR-222 expression was analysed using PCR starter kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); U6 was used as an endogenous control. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) on StepOne detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Expression was normalised to the house-keeping gene 18S.Protein extraction and western blotsCells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer System (lysis buffer pH 7.4, 200\u2009mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail,\u00a0100\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate) (Santa Cruz-sc24948). The lysates were centrifuged at 12700\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u02daC. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) then transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk. The membrane was then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India). Bands were visualised using ECL.Histology, laser capture microdissection (LMD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)LMD was carried out on the Zeiss PALM Laser Capture Microdissection Microscope exactly as described previously. In brief, archival FFPE cancer blocks and matched normal blocks were obtained and sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm onto Membrane Slides NF 1.0 PEN (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A guide section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a histopathologist (LMW) to identify areas of fibroblasts with very few admixed inflammatory cells, epithelial cells or necrosis. The equivalent areas were then identified on other sections, and these were collected with the laser into lids of AdhesiveCap500 opaque PCR Tubes (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by laser pressure catapulting (LPC). The microscope settings used for LCM were cut energy 71, focus 65, LPC energy 100, focus 65 at \u00d7100 magnification. Areas dissected from each case varied between 5.2 and 27.4\u00d7106\u2009\u03bcm2 depending on fibroblast density. For IHC, FFPE human breast cancer resection tissue was available; cancerous and non-cancerous breast tissue were immunostained for \u03b1-SMA and LBR. The signal was amplified and visualised with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen, followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin.Luciferase reporter assaysLamin B Receptor (LBR) is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts and is downregulated in breast CAFs relative to matched NFs. a LBR was identified as a potential miR-222 target by bioinformatics. The potential miR-222-binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is shown (WT), along with a binding-dead mutant used experimentally (MUT). b Luciferase reporters were cloned that allow expression of luciferase transcripts containing the wild-type or mutant LBR miR-222 3\u2032UTR binding sites. These were transfected into NFs (left) or CAFs (right) along with either miR-222 mimic or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC), and relative luciferase activity was determined. The data represent two biological replicates. c, d NFs or CAFs were transfected as shown, and the relative expression of endogenous LBR was determined using qPCR (c) or western blots (d). qPCR data represent three biological replicates. e Representative matched pair of normal and breast cancer tissues was assessed for expression of LBR by immunohistochemistry (\u00d710 and \u00d720 magnification). Brown staining represents expression of the target protein, while pink is a counterstain. f Relative expression of LBR was assessed in eight pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour. The data represent technical triplicates. g Protein expression levels of LBR, and the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA and vimentin were assessed by western blotting in three pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05The potential miR-222 binding sequence from the LBR gene (WT LBR) and three nucleotide-mutated LBR (MUT LBR) (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned into pMiRGLO (Promega, WI, USA) under restriction sites PmeI and XbaI (primers listed in Table\u00a0S1). Luciferase activities were measured 48\u2009h after transfection using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays (Promega, WI, USA).Cell proliferation assaysNFs and CAFs were seeded in 96-well plates at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well and transfected the following day. Cell proliferation was monitored after 72\u2009h by MTT (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). In total, 10\u2009\u00b5l of MTT solution (10\u2009mg/ml) in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMEM media was added per well. After 4\u2009h of incubation, formazan complexes were dissolved in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMSO, and signals were measured using MULTISCANGO plate reader (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). To evaluate the effects of conditioned media, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were seeded in 96-well plates at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, condition media was applied. MTT assays were performed at 48\u2009h as above.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion ability were determined by Corning transwell insert chambers (8-\u00b5m pores; Corning, MA, USA) and Matrigel (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) coated in a transwell chamber for invasion analysis. Conditional media from different treatment conditions were used in lower chambers for migration and invasion study. The cells were prior treated with conditional media for 48\u2009h. In total, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 were added into chambers and incubated for 28\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells that had migrated or invaded were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, imaged and counted manually.Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) assaysSA-\u03b2-gal activity was detected by \u03b2-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing blue stain were counted manually as positive senescent cells, and images were taken under phase contrast.Cell immunostaining and confocal microscopyNFs and CAFs were allowed to attach to glass coverslips overnight at 37\u2009\u02daC. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20\u2009min) and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 (15\u2009min). Blocking was performed with 5% BSA for 1\u2009h followed by incubation with \u03b1-SMA and vimentin primary antibodies (4\u2009\u02daC overnight). AlexaFluor 488-conjugated and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1\u2009h. Coverslips were counterstained with DAPI and analysed on a confocal microscope (Olympus).CloningFor the LBR-overexpressing vector, LBR open-reading frame was cloned within pCDNA 3.1+ vector using KpnI and XbaI restriction sites and primers GTGGTACCACCATGCCAAGTAGGAAATTTG (forward) and GCTCTAGAGCTTAGTAGATGTATGGAAATATACGG (reverse).Statistical analysesAll data are representative of at least three independent experiments. The results are presented as means \u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments in all the figures. Differences were considered statistically significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05 using Student\u2019s t test.ResultsmiR-222 is upregulated in breast CAFs, and controls CAF phenotypesMany studies have shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in CAFs. To investigate roles of miR-222 dysregulation in CAF biology, we first assessed relative expression of miR-222 in 14 matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that have been isolated from breast cancer resection samples using laser microdissection (LMD). We found miR-222 to be upregulated in CAFs relative to matched NFs in 11 out of 14 cases, representing significant upregulation overall by a mean fold of 3.63 (p\u2009<\u20090.04; Fig.\u00a01a, left plot). To expand this finding, we further assessed miR-222 expression in four matched pairs of primary human breast NFs and CAFs cultures extracted from breast cancer resections; we found a greater than twofold induction of miR-222 in CAFs as compared with matched NFs in all cases (Fig.\u00a01a, middle plot). Finally, miR-222 expression in immortalised human breast NFs was compared with immortalised human breast CAFs; this also showed higher expression of miR-222 in CAFs by more than threefold (Fig.\u00a01a, right plot). We concluded that miR-222 is more highly expressed in CAFs than NFs in breast tissue.To explore functional roles of miR-222 in transformation of NFs to CAFs, we conducted a series of experiments on immortalised human breast NFs or immortalised human breast CAFs using miR-222 mimics to upregulate expression in NFs, or miR-222 inhibitors to downregulate expression in CAFs. First, miR-222 expression was assessed using qRT-PCR to confirm appropriate over- or under-expression (Fig.\u00a01b); miR-222 was significantly overexpressed by more than eightfold and was knocked down to one-third of its original level. Next, the relatively \u201cnormal\u201d or CAF-like phenotypes of these cell lines were characterised to establish their baselines for subsequent analyses. Expression of a range of classical CAF markers was assessed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a01c), immunofluorescence or western blotting (Fig.\u00a0S1). Relative expressions of ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin), FSP, CCL2 and VEGF were all substantially higher in CAFs as compared with NFs (a minimum of fivefold higher as assessed by qRT-PCR), as indicative of the CAF phenotype. Upregulation in CAFs of ACTA2/smooth muscle actin and vimentin was also confirmed at the protein level (Fig.\u00a0S1). Next, NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control mimics, and CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or control inhibitors, and miR-222\u2032s influence on transformation of NFs to CAFs, or on maintenance of the CAF phenotype was examined using the same panel of CAF markers as previously. Transfection of miR-222 mimics in NFs resulted in significant upregulation of all the CAF markers (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, left plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). Furthermore, downregulation of miR-222 in CAFs using miR-222 inhibitors significantly downregulated expression of the CAF markers, with the notable and surprising exception of CCL2 (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, right plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). We concluded that miR-222 levels play key roles in controlling the CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.LBR is a direct target of miR-222To investigate potential mechanisms by which miR-222 plays roles in breast fibroblast biology, bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential target genes of miR-222. We analysed the best possible miR-222 seed matches using miRanda, TargetScan and miRDB software. Eleven predicted target genes were chosen for further analysis based on the target scores, containing seed matches for miR-222. On analysis of expression by qRT-PCR in NFs and paired CAFs from patient samples three of these genes, RECK, THOP1 and LBR, demonstrated differential expression in the predicted direction. LBR showed the most substantial and consistent dysregulated result in NFs and CAFs, and therefore LBR was prioritised for subsequent analyses. The potential miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is depicted in Fig.\u00a02a. We performed a number of different assays to assess whether LBR is a true direct target of miR-222 within breast fibroblasts. First, luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type miR-222 binding site from the LBR 3\u2032UTR or a mutated (non-binding) version of the site (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned. Reporters were co-transfected with miR-222 mimics and inhibitors, or appropriate controls, in NFs and CAFs respectively, and luciferase assays were performed. MiR-222 mimics significantly inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter containing the wild-type LBR site, while the mutated site was insensitive to miR-222 overexpression in NFs (Fig.\u00a02b, left plot), whereas miR-222 inhibitors significantly increased the activity of the wild-type reporter, while the mutated reporter was again insensitive in CAFs (Fig.\u00a02b, right plot). Next, endogenous LBR expression was assessed in NFs after transfection to overexpress miR-222, and in CAFs after transfection with miR-222 inhibitors (Fig.\u00a02c, d). LBR expression was downregulated by miR-222 overexpression and upregulated by miR-222 inhibition at the level of both transcript (Fig.\u00a02c) and protein (Fig.\u00a02d), findings that were in accordance with it being downstream of miR-222 function. We concluded that LBR is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts, via a canonical miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR.Downregulation of LBR induces a CAF-like phenotypeOur next aim was to determine whether LBR downregulation is involved in determining the breast CAF phenotype, since we have already determined that CAFs overexpress miR-222 and that this can downregulate LBR. In one approach, we examined whether breast normal stroma or tumour stroma exhibit differential expression of LBR using immunohistochemistry. LBR expression (Fig.\u00a02e) was relatively reduced in tumour stroma, in contrast to ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin) (Fig.\u00a0S2), which was relatively high in tumour stroma. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed on eight matched pairs of primary NF and CAF cultures. LBR expression was significantly reduced by a mean of 4.3-fold in CAFs compared with the NFs (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in contrast to expression of the CAF markers ACTA2 and vimentin, which were upregulated in CAFs as expected and indicative of the CAF phenotype (Fig.\u00a02f, g).LBR regulates the NF vs CAF breast fibroblast phenotype. a, b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or control (NC), or plasmid to allow overexpression of LBR (LBR OE) or control plasmid (pCDNA), and LBR expression was assessed using qPCR (a) or western blots (b). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. c\u2013e Immortalised breast NFs (c, e) or CAFs (d, e) were transfected as shown, and the relative expression levels of the CAF marker genes \u03b1-SMA, fibroblast-specific protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were determined by qPCR (c, d), or of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin by western blot (e). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005We next assessed whether LBR downregulation was sufficient for transformation of NFs to CAFs, and conversely whether LBR overexpression would reduce CAF features. We transfected immortalised breast NFs with siRNA targeted against LBR or with an appropriate non-targeting control, and also transfected immortalised breast CAFs with plasmids to allow overexpression of LBR, or with appropriate control plasmids. The efficacy of knockdown and overexpression was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a) and western blots (Fig.\u00a03b); knockdown was to ~30% of the original levels, while overexpression was by more than ninefold. Next, we assessed expression of our panel of CAF markers in these cells after knockdown or overexpression of LBR using qRT-PCR or western blots as previously. Reduction of LBR expression in NFs, and increased expression of LBR in CAFs, significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the expression of all the CAF markers (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). We concluded that LBR is a key regulator of the breast CAF phenotype, and that knockdown of LBR alone is sufficient to transform NFs into cells that resemble CAFs.MiR-222 and LBR regulate migration, invasion and senescence in breast fibroblastsMiR-222 and its downstream target LBR modulate the behaviour of breast fibroblasts. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). a, b Migration (a) or invasion (b) of fibroblasts was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (a, b, upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (a, b, lower panels). c Expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase was also assessed by X-gal staining and is shown as blue green colouration (upper panels). Positive cells were quantified in data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). d Expression of the senescence markers MMP3 and osteopontin (OPN) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers IL6 and IL8 were assessed by qPCR in NFs (left plot) and CAFs (right plot). The data represent biological triplicates. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Since it has been previously demonstrated that CAFs are characterised by higher cell motility than their adjacent NFs, we also investigated whether miR-222 overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of LBR would induce increased NF migration or invasion, and conversely whether miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression would reduce CAF migration or invasion. Immortalised breast NFs or CAFs were transfected as previously with miR-222 mimics or inhibitors, respectively, or with siRNA targeted against LBR or overexpression of LBR, respectively. We then performed migration or invasion assays using transwell assays. NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siRNA targeting LBR had significantly higher migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, left plots), whereas inhibition of miR-222 or LBR overexpression in CAFs significantly reduced their migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, right plots). In order to confirm that these apparent effects on migration and invasion did not relate to differences in cell numbers induced by the transfections, we also evaluated proliferation capabilities of fibroblasts after these manipulations of miR-222 or LBR expression. We performed MTT assays after the same transfected conditions as mentioned above; there were no significant differences in proliferation of NFs or CAFs after any of these treatments (Fig.\u00a0S3). We concluded that miR-222 and its target LBR have key influences on aspects of CAF-like fibroblast behaviour, namely migration and invasion.It was previously reported that loss of LBR is associated with induction of cellular senescence, therefore, we also specifically evaluated senescence by determining senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activities in NFs and CAFs after dysregulation of expression of miR-222 or LBR. We found an increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siLBR compared to controls (Fig.\u00a04c, left plot). In addition, inhibition of miR-222 activity or increased LBR expression in CAFs significantly reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right plot). We also further examined features of this senescence phenotype by determining whether it was also associated with differential expression of other senescence markers. NFs and CAFs were transfected as before, and qRT-PCR was used to assess expression of MMP3, OPN, IL6 and IL8, which are upregulated in senescent cells particularly those showing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Expression of all four markers was significantly upregulated in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimic or siLBR (Fig.\u00a04d, left plot), while expression was significantly downregulated in CAFs transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or to overexpress LBR (Fig.\u00a04d, right plot). This provided strong support that changes in \u03b2-gal activity we had detected were indeed associated with senescence, and that miR-222 and LBR expression impact on senescence phenotypes in breast fibroblasts.miR-222 and LBR in breast fibroblasts regulate proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cellsMiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to influence cancer cell proliferation and metastatic potential. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. a, b Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled was determined using MTT assay. The data represent biological triplicates. c\u2013f Migration (c, e) or invasion (d, f) of epithelial cancer cells was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05To better understand the exact effects of miR-222 and its action on LBR in fibroblasts on epithelial breast cancer cell behaviour, we assessed abilities of NFs and CAFs after manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression to induce growth or migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. In particular, we focused on the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and the relatively less metastatic and triple-negative MDA-MB-157 cell lines. In order to assess influences of fibroblasts on the cancer cells, we decided to collect conditioned medium from fibroblasts and treat cancer cells with this. Fibroblast-conditioned medium has frequently been shown to influence cancer cell behaviour in this context. NFs or CAFs were transfected exactly as previously. Conditional medium (CM) was collected from these cells after transfection, and was added to cultures of epithelial breast cancer cells. First, proliferation of epithelial cells was assessed using MTT assays after treatment with CM (Fig.\u00a05a, b). In both epithelial cell lines, CM from control NFs caused a marginal, but not significant, reduction in proliferation, while CM from control CAFs caused a marked and significant increase in proliferation when compared with cells without CM (p\u2009<\u20090.005), as has been reported previously. More interestingly, overexpression of miR-222 in NFs and knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs significantly altered the activity of these CMs on both epithelial cell lines; miR-222 overexpression in NFs produced CM that had similar growth inducing effects to that from control CAFs, while knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs reduced this growth stimulation (Fig.\u00a05a). Changes in LBR expression within NFs and CAFs also had similar significant effects, with LBR knockdown allowing CM from NFs to induce relative growth increases, while overexpression of LBR in CAFs reduced the growth stimulatory effect of CAF CM (Fig.\u00a05b). We concluded that upregulation of miR-222 and downregulation of LBR were both necessary and sufficient for CAF function with respect to inducing proliferation of breast cancer cells. Next, we investigated the influences of these CMs on the motility of BC cells. BC cells also responded dramatically and significantly to these CMs in terms of migration and invasion capacities. CM from NFs had little influence on migration, while CM from CAFs significant and consistently induced migration (Fig.\u00a05c, e) and invasion (Fig.\u00a05d, f) in both epithelial cell lines. Overexpression of miR-222 or knockdown of LBR in NFs led to enhanced migration in the epithelial lines. Knockdown of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs led to reduced migration in the epithelial lines. Exactly the same result was evident in terms of invasion, with miR-222 and LBR having a key influence on abilities of NFs or CAFs to induce invasion in both epithelial cell lines (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f). To further clarify that differences in migration/invasion of the breast cancer epithelial cells treated with CM did not solely relate to changes in proliferation rate, we additionally performed an experiment assessing proliferation in the cells treated exactly as for the migration/invasion assay (Fig.\u00a0S4), which involves an earlier time point than that used for Fig.\u00a05a, b. There were no significant differences in almost all combinations, supporting the conclusion that true differences in migration/invasion were seen. An exception is MDA-MB-157 cells treated with CAF CM, in which a significant reduction in proliferation was seen with CM after miR-222 knockdown and LBR overexpression; however, this change in proliferation was only up to 20% (Fig.\u00a0S4), whereas decreases in migration/invasion were up to 50% (Fig.\u00a05e, f), indicating that\u2014again\u2014true influences on migration/invasion were seen.MiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to activate EMT in breast cancer cells. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. Expression levels of the EMT-associated genes slug and vimentin were assessed in MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled using qPCR (a, c) or western blots (b, d). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Finally, to determine whether the fibroblasts were influencing migration and invasion capacity of epithelial cells by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, we analysed expression of EMT markers slug and vimentin in the BC cells after culture with the same CMs, using both qRT-PCR and western blots (Fig.\u00a06). CM from NFs had little influence on slug or vimentin expression at either transcript or protein level, while CM from CAFs induced up to a sixfold increase in expression. Manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression in the fibroblasts consistently and significantly altered slug and vimentin expression in accordance with the changes in migration and invasion, with greater slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade more by miR-222 mimics or LBR siRNA in NFs, and reduced slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade less by miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression in CAFs. We concluded that miR-222 and, downstream of this, LBR have key influences on abilities of breast fibroblasts to control critical cancer-related behaviours of breast epithelial cancer cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT.DiscussionIncreasing evidence supports the proposal that miRNA dysregulation within CAFs modulates function of the tumour microenvironment. However, it is worth highlighting that most studies have emphasised investigation of miRNA roles within the tumour cells themselves, therefore it remains the case that relatively little is known about roles of miRNAs in the tumour microenvironment. In this study, we have focussed on roles of miR-222 within fibroblasts.We initially compared the miR-222 expression difference between CAFs and adjacent NFs in breast cancer tissue samples. Our study demonstrated that miR-222 was significantly upregulated in CAFs. Although others have made similar comparisons for multiple miRNAs in this context, miR-222 has not previously been identified as differentially expressed. This may be because studies have not always effectively purified only the fibroblasts for their analyses, as we have by LMD, or may be because miR-222 was not always included in the analyses. Next, we identified that miR-222 targets Lamin B receptor (LBR) expression in the CAFs. Various targets of miR-222 have been published previously, but LBR is a novel target on which we focused since we were able to confirm its downregulation in CAFs in accordance with negative regulation by the upregulated miR-222. Most importantly, downregulation of LBR with siRNA phenocopied miR-222 overexpression in functional experiments using breast fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that LBR is a key functionally important target of miR-222 in these cells.In terms of cellular function, we showed that miR-222 and LBR were both involved in defining and maintaining the breast CAF phenotype in terms of expression patterns, and fibroblast behaviours including migration and invasion. MiR-222 has previously been assigned roles in promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and drug resistance within cancer cells, so our findings are in accordance with this, although they represent the first observations to our knowledge in a cancer stromal cell type. With respect to functions of LBR, a role in senescence has previously been reported in fibroblasts and we also observed a related result with manipulation of LBR expression by siRNA, overexpression or via miR-222 all impacting on senescence in breast fibroblasts. LBR encodes the lamin B receptor, a 70.4-kD protein of the inner nuclear membrane, which is known to interact with heterochromatin and B-type lamins. Other functions for the protein have been implied by observations that ectopic LBR expression deregulates differentiation of olfactory neurons inducing an un- or early-differentiated state.More excitingly, we showed that fibroblasts with differential expression of miR-222 or LBR have potent differential influences on behaviour of two independent breast epithelial cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that conditioned medium from fibroblasts that were stimulated to be more CAF-like by miR-222 overexpression or siLBR promoted breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Similarly, abilities of conditioned medium from CAFs to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion was inhibited by reduced miR-222 levels or by LBR overexpression. Next, we investigated possible pathways involved in the breast tumour motility effects. We found that the enhanced migration and invasion were associated with increased expression of vimentin and slug in the BC cells, suggesting involvement of the EMT pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-222 upregulation, and subsequent LBR downregulation, within fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment contribute to progression of BC, through induction of proliferation and EMT-related motility. It is established that cancer progression is not only dependent on tumour cells themselves but also dependent on the tumour microenvironment and, in particular, CAFs, which promote growth and invasion of cancer cells through synthesis and remodelling of ECM and secreting some growth factors. Hence, blocking CAF activity may be a key approach to effectively control cancer metastasis. Manipulation of either miR-222 expression or LBR function provide candidate approaches for development of these types of anti-cancer therapies. In particular, our data demonstrate that reduced expression of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs greatly reduces their ability to promote aggressive behaviours in cancer cells, supporting the proposal that CAF phenotypes are not fixed and could be normalised therapeutically.Surprisingly, our data also implicate the miR-222/LBR axis in senescence induction in CAFs. Previous studies have indicated that increased miR-222 or loss of LBR induces senescence, so this is not a surprise in itself; however, it is unexpected that high levels of senescence in CAFs would be associated with cancer cell behaviours that promote progression, since senescence is often regarded as a tumour-suppressor mechanism in cancer cells. However, more recent evidence shows that senescent cells may promote oncogenesis through secretion of secretory factors (SASP) and several reports describe abilities of senescent human fibroblasts to promote growth and tumorigenesis. In support of this, here, we demonstrated that miR-222 overexpression in NFs induces a SASP phenotype, leading to increased secretion of at least the SASP factors IL6 and IL8, and the classical senescence marker MMP3.In conclusion, we present miR-222 and LBR as key molecules involved in transformation and maintenance of breast CAFs, which in turn therefore impacts on the aggressive tumorigenic behaviour of breast cancer cells. These molecules are novel targets for therapeutic intervention.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-019-0566-7.Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.Ethics approval and consent to participateEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, references 06/Q1206/180 and 09/H1306/108, and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015.FundingThe study has been funded by University Grants Commission (UGC), India [F.101-5/2014(IC)] and Royal Society, UK (Ref No. IE160146).

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3).

(C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027).

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "Integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) overexpression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression. However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

        "content": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine with the capability to act as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the cellular context. TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) is the ligand-binding receptor for all members of the TGF-\u03b2 family. Data from mouse model experiments demonstrated that loss of Tgfbr2 expression in mammary fibroblasts was linked to tumour initiation and metastasis. Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values. The study revealed that CAF-specific TGFBR2 expression correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed CAF-TGFBR2 to be an independent prognostic marker (multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratio: 0.534, 95% (CI): 0.360-0.793, P=0.002). CAF-specific pSMAD2 levels, however, did not associate with survival outcome. Experimentally, TGF-\u03b2 signalling in fibroblasts was modulated using a TGF-\u03b2 ligand and inhibitor or through lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated TGFBR2-specific knockdown. To determine the role of fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway on breast cancer cells, we used cell contact-dependent cell growth and clonogenicity assays, which showed that knockdown of TGFBR2 in CAFs resulted in increased cell growth, proliferation and clonogenic survival. Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored. We found that mouse xenograft tumours comprising TGFBR2 knockdown fibroblasts were slightly bigger and displayed increased tumour cell capacity. Overall, our data demonstrate that fibroblast-related biomarkers possess clinically relevant information and that fibroblasts confer effects on breast cancer cell growth and survival. Regulation of tumour-stromal cross-talk through fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway may depend on fibroblast phenotype, emphasising the importance to characterise tumour microenvironment subtypes. ",

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

        "content": "Loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is predictive of poor prognosis in breast cancer, but its function has not been established. Our study tested the hypotheses that loss of Cav-1 expression in breast fibroblasts was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, through promotion of breast cancer cell invasion. Cav-1 stromal expression was immunohistochemically assessed in 358 breast cancers. Cav-1 expression in primary breast fibroblasts was analysed by western blot. Modified Boyden chamber assays determined fibroblast ability to promote invasion of breast cancer cells. The impact of siRNA silencing of Cav-1 in fibroblasts was evaluated using invasion assays and 3D co-culture assays. Loss of Cav-1 expression in breast stroma was significantly associated with decreased breast cancer-specific and disease-free survival (p = 0.01). Mean survival was 72 months (Cav-1(+) group) versus 29.5 months (Cav-1(-) group). This was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Cav-1 expression was significantly decreased in CAFs compared to normal fibroblasts (p = 0.01) and was associated with increased invasion-promoting capacity. Cav-1 siRNA-treated fibroblasts promoted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-468 and T47D breast cancer cells from 27% (control) to 67% (p = 0.006) and from 37% to 56%, respectively (p = 0.01). 3D co-cultures of MDA-MB-468 cells with myoepithelial cells led to the formation of organized cohesive structures when cultured with conditioned media from fibroblasts but resulted in a disorganized appearance in the presence of conditioned media from Cav-1 siRNA-treated fibroblasts, accompanied by loss of E-cadherin expression in tumour cells. Our data confirm that loss of stromal Cav-1 in breast cancer predicts poor outcome. At a functional level, Cav-1-deficient CAFs are capable of significantly increasing the invasive capacity of breast cancer cells.",

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature.

        "content": "Multiple juxtacrine and paracrine interactions occur between cancer cells and non-cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that direct tumor progression. Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are an integral component of the TME, and the majority of breast tumor stroma is comprised of CAFs. Heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and non-cancer cells of the TME occur via soluble agents, including cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and secreted microRNAs. We previously identified a microRNA signature indicative of hyperactive MAPK signaling (hMAPK-miRNA signature) that significantly associated with reduced recurrence-free and overall survival. Here we report that the hMAPK-miRNA signature associates with a high metric of stromal cell infiltrate, and we investigate the role of microRNAs, particularly hMAPK-microRNAs, secreted by CAFs on estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast cancer cells. ER-positive MCF-7/ltE2- cells were treated with conditioned media (CM) from CAFs derived from breast cancers of different PAM50 subtypes (CAFBAS, CAFHER2, and CAFLA). CAF CM isolated specifically from ER-negative primary breast tumors led to ER repression in vitro. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of CAF-secreted exosomes in CM and the uptake of these exosomes by the ER+ MCF-7/ltE2- cells. Differentially expressed microRNAs in CAF CM as well as in MCF-7/ltE2- cells treated with this CM were identified. Knockdown of miR-221/222 in CAFBAS resulted in knockdown of miR221/222 levels in the conditioned media and the CM from CAFBAS; miR221/222 knockdown rescued ER repression in ER-positive cell lines treated with CAFBAS-CM. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CAF-secreted microRNAs are directly involved in ER-repression, and may contribute to the MAPK-induced ER repression in breast cancer cells.",

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

MDA and SCPs cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b21 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine. For stable cell line generation, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and pools of stable cells were selected with 10 ng/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs in the absence of insulin and hydrocortisone before TGF\u03b21 stimulation.Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitationCells were lysed in cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin hydrochloride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal protein was analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-p21 (F5), mouse anti-c-myc, mouse anti-p15, rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-cofilin and cofilin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and followed by secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or rabbit. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4\u00b0C using antibodies against p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (Abcam\u00ae, Cambridge, MA, USA) and p21. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was added for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and washed four times with cold lysis buffer. The immunocomplexes were boiled with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.Histone proteins extractionTotal histone proteins were extracted as previously described. Briefly, 80% confluent of SCP2 cells from a 100-mm tissue culture plate were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 or 1 \u00b5M trichostatin A (TSA). SCP2 cells were harvested and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 \u00b5M TSA and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u00b5l trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes. Total histone proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an acetylated lysine antibody (Millipore).DNA affinity precipitation assaySCP2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated siRNAs were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes.

A total of 500 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides (IDT) was added and incubated with cell lysates for two hours at 4\u00b0C. Streptavidin-agarose beads (65 \u00b5l; Sigma) were added, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose beads containing biotinylated oligonucleotides and protein complex were boiled with 2\u00d7 SDS Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.

Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equipment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s).

After two days, 25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity.

The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

        "content": "The lack of targeted therapy for women with triple negative breast cancer demands a \"think-outside-the-box\" approach in search of novel treatment strategies. Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a special focus on FAP(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the \"generic\" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.",

The resulting transformed microenvironment, also-called reactive stroma, differs from the stroma of the healthy mammary gland, showing disruptions in the fibroblast-epithelial cell cross-talk in terms of cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodelling. In particular, the migratory/invasive behaviour of tumor cells seems to be strongly influenced by this aberrant dialogue with the adjacent fibroblasts. The release of soluble factors by both kinds of cell types reciprocally influences their peculiar properties, creating suitable conditions for malignant cells not only to multiply but also to migrate and invade other tissues, outside the boundaries of the mammary gland. Fibroblasts arising from tumor stroma, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs), have acquired distinct properties mainly leading to the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Differences in the activity of NFs versus CAFs in breast tumors may result from alterations in molecular and/or cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the production and release by CAFs of a number of soluble factors such as fibroblast growth factors, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), insulin-like growth factors, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Tumorigenicity of CAFs, derived from breast tumors and injected together with malignant cells, has been widely demonstrated in animal models. Induction of mammary cancers has also been demonstrated in mice orthotopically grafted with TGF-\u03b2-and/or HGF-transfected fibroblasts co-injected with apparently normal epithelial breast cells, highlighting the critical role of heterotypic interactions in human breast development. This tumor-stroma cross-talk seems to have an important influence also in the involved lymph-node microenvironments, as demonstrated by the ability of nodal fibroblasts to affect viability, proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. At the root of the alterations in these latter activities seems to be the induction of reciprocal changes in the genomic profiles of cancer and stromal cells involving, in particular, genes critical for growth control, cell adhesion and invasiveness.Despite the growing number of studies focused on epithelial-stromal interactions in solid tumors, the role played by fibroblasts in the development and progression of breast cancer is not yet fully understood. Thus, the use of relevant co-culture models using fibroblasts derived from normal and malignant stroma may provide a practical tool for the analysis of reciprocal influences between the stroma and the epithelial tumor compartment.In the present report, we sought to gain a deeper insight into some molecular and functional properties strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastatization. These properties may be supposed to be reciprocally influenced in the epithelium-stroma cross-talk occurring in breast cancer. With this aim, we performed breast cancer cells/fibroblasts co-culture assays and analyzed changes occurring in adhesion molecule expression, membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness in both the cell types. In our experimental approach, we co-cultured estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive and low metastasizing mammary cancer cells (MCF-7) or ER-negative, highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with fibroblasts isolated from mammary healthy skin (NFs) or from breast tumor stroma (CAFs) in conventional 2D adherent cultures or in a 3D system (nodules). Results obtained were compared with those from the respective homotypic cultures.Materials and MethodsBreast cancer cell linesThe estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive, and low metastasizing human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative, highly invasive, and metastatic human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Euroclone, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone) and 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.Clinical specimens and fibroblast culturesBreast cancer tissues and their relative normal counterparts (normal mammary skin samples) were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Unit\u00e0 Operativa di Chirurgia Senologica, Facolt\u00e0 di Medicina e Chirurgia \u201cA. Gemelli\u201d, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, Italy), according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Donors gave written informed consent to participate in the study.Breast cancer and normal mammary skin tissue samples were minced into small pieces (2\u20133 mm3) and attached onto 100 mm culture dishes. Primary normal mammary skin (NFs) and cancer-associated (CAFs) fibroblasts isolated from clinical specimens were maintained in DMEM (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone), 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.The fibroblastic nature of the isolated cells was verified by microscopic determination of morphology portrait and immunocytochemical characterization using fibroblast- (anti-vimentin, V9 clone, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); epithelial tumor cell- (anti-cytokeratin 18, DC 10 clone, Dako), activated fibroblast- (anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, \u03b1-SMA, 1A4 clone, Dako), and endothelial cell- (anti-CD31, 89C2 clone, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) specific markers. NFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin but negative for all the other markers. CAFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin and \u03b1-SMA but negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31. Co-culture experiments were carried out with fibroblasts (NFs and CAFs) of passage 2\u20133 to accumulate large amounts of cells for co-cultivation while avoiding cell aging effects.3D cultures/co-culturesFor the immnunohistochemical/immunoflurescence analysis, primary fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) were directly co-cultured with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D model (nodules) as previously described. Briefly, after detachment of cell monolayers with trypsin/EDTA, the cell density was arranged to 2.5\u00d7105 cells/ml for each cell type. One ml of the cell suspension was distributed in 5-ml centrifugation tubes containing semi-solid medium (final concentration: 1\u00d7DMEM-0.5% agar-agar). Cells were spinned down onto the semi-solid medium by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min at 12\u00b0C. Most of the supernatant liquid medium was removed and the tubes incubated overnight in an incubator at 37\u00b0C. The next day, the pellets were recovered with 200 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7DMEM by gentle aspiration and transferred on 1006-Falcon Petri dishes containing 2 ml of semi-solid medium. Medium was renewed 2 days later and then after 5 days.For co-cultures, a 1\u22361 proportion of each cell type was used. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type were used as controls.After 4 or 6 days of culture, nodules were harvested for immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence analysis.2D cultures/co-culturesFor the evaluation of vimentin expression, cell membrane fluidity and migration, conventional 2D adherent cultures were used. Briefly, confluent fibroblast and breast cancer cell cultures were trypsinized and 0.5\u00d7105 cells of each cell type were plated together in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) for confocal microscopy analysis in their standard medium, which was renewed after 3 days. After for 6 days, membrane fluidity or cell migration were evaluated as described below. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type (1\u00d7105 cells) were used as controls.ImmunohistochemistryTo verify the distribution of the two cell types in 3D co-cultures, and the effects of the heterotypic interactions on fibroblast activation and cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of pankeratin, \u03b1-SMA and proliferation markers (Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) was performed on cryostat 10-\u00b5m-thick sections from 4- and 6-day frozen nodules. Nodules were previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA), dried for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic, Rome, Italy) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer of pH 6.0 for 5 min. The sections were incubated with anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin, KL1 clone; UCS Diagnostic; 1\u2236100 dilution), anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4 clone, Dako; 1\u223660 dilution), anti-Ki67 (MIB-1 clone, Dako; 1\u2236100 dilution) and anti-PCNA (PC10 clone, Dako; 1\u2236150 dilution) 1 h at RT in PBS. Then, a secondary antibody conjugate (HRP polymer conjugate, broad spectrum, Invitrogen) was applied for 30 min at RT. The chromogenic reaction was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Zymed Labs., South S. Francisco, CA, USA). The nuclei were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed. For proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA), three sections from three different nodules for each culture condition were examined by two independent observers. The number of positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. All the labelled tumor nuclei, regardless of the staining intensity, were considered positive. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy AnalysisTo assess the effect of tumor cell/fibroblast interaction on cell adhesion, immunofluorescence analysis of E- and N-cadherin was performed on cryostat 10 \u00b5m-thick frozen sections obtained as above described from 6-day nodule homotypic and heterotypic cultures. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific), dried for 15 min at RT and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Mouse monoclonal primary antibodies anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7 clone, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 1\u2236200 dilution) and anti-N-cadherin (GC-4 clone, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1\u22361000 dilution) were applied for 1 h at RT in PBS. Sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG, 1\u2236200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at RT in PBS. Slides were mounted using 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) containing mounting medium (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA, USA). Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed for all reactions. Images were collected by using an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). They were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) equipped with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) for DAPI excitation at 750 nm and with an Ar/ArKr laser for Cy3 excitation at 543 nm. Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Image background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and colored black. Imaging was performed at RT.Fluorescence Intensity values for each sample were quantified over multiple intensity images and ROIs and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test).Western blot analysisCells of 6-day monolayer cultures were collected to be analyzed for verify the co-culturing effect on vimentin expression. Cells in mixed cultures were separated by magnetic cell sorting, using the EasySep\u2122 Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, Voden Medical Instruments SpA, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS] freshly supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (100 \u00b5M Na3VO4, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 50 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin and 20 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin) on ice and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Samples containing 30 \u00b5g of total protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) which was incubated (1 h, at RT) with anti-vimentin antibody (clone V9, Dako, 1\u22361000 dilution) in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk (blocking buffer). The blot was then overlaid with a HRP-labelled secondary antibody (Vector Labs.; 1\u22362000 dilution) for 40 min in blocking buffer at RT. The protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualised on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Membranes were reprobed with an anti \u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC15, Sigma-Aldrich; 1\u223610,000 dilution) as an internal control for protein loading. The signals were quantified by densitometry (Chemi Doc Documentation System/Quantity One quantitation software, Bio-Rad).Laurdan two photon microscopyTo investigate the impact of tumour cell/fibroblast interactions on the respective membrane lipid packing density, homotypic or heterotypic cultures, maintained for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes, were labelled with 2-dimethylamino(6-lauroyl)naphthalene (Laurdan, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA), a ratiometric fluorescent dye highly sensitive to the presence and mobility of water molecules within the membrane bilayer, yielding information on membrane order and fluidity by a shift in its emission spectrum. The probe was successfully applied to study membrane fluidity changes in living cells. Ratiometric probes allow the use of a ratio between two fluorescence intensities. This makes possible the correction of artifacts due to bleaching, changes in focus and variations in laser intensity. The Laurdan stock solution concentration was 2 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and it was renewed every three weeks. Laurdan labelling was performed directly in the culture media by adding the probe to the cells in culture at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M. After 30\u201345 min of incubation in the dark at RT, cells were washed once with the complete culture medium and dishes mounted on an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems) slide. Laurdan intensity images were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) under excitation at 800 nm with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Laurdan intensity images were recorded simultaneously with emission in the range of 400\u2013460 nm and 470\u2013530 nm and imaging was performed at RT.Image analysisMembrane fluidity can be measured in terms of ratio of emission intensities by using Generalized Polarization (GP) value, defined asGP value was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images (I(400\u2013460) and I(470\u2013530)) using the software Ratiometric image processor 2.0. The calibration factor G was obtained from the GP values of solutions of Laurdan in DMSO. G factor had \u223c2% variation across the imaging area. GP images (as eight-bit unsigned images) were pseudocoloured in Image-J. Background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and coloured black. GP histograms values were determined within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample, and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test). Line profiles and analysis of acquired images were performed with image J.Migration assayTo evaluate the reciprocal influences of tumour cells and fibroblasts on the respective migratory ability, confocal microscopy was performed in a temperature controlled room (T\u200a=\u200a30\u00b0C) on cells (homotypic and heterotypic cultures) cultured for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes. In each experiment, the single cell type of interest (tumor cells or fibroblasts) has been labelled with the fluorescent probe CellTracker Green CMFDA (Invitrogen) that is retained in living cells through several generations and is not transferred to adjacent cells. Thus, the single cell movement was analyzed over a time period of 45 min. The time interval between consecutive frames was one min. Background noise was subtracted from each image. Cell tracking was performed by using the ImageJ software plugin \u201cParticleTracker\u201d. On average 40 cells per experiment were tracked. Once the analysis region was defined by means of the feature point detection and tracking algorithm, each cell was numbered and its (x(ti), y(ti)) position coordinates measured for each time point ti (i\u200a=\u200a1,\u2026.,N\u200a=\u200a45). We used the ImageJ-plugin \u201cChemotaxis and migration tool\u201d to analyze kinematic quantities of migration processes: the migration velocity, the Euclidean and accumulated distances and the directness. The instantaneous migration velocity for each cell was calculated as  where vix and viy were calculated according to the expression:Where (x(ti+1), y(ti+1), (x(ti), y(ti))) are the positions of each cell at the time ti+1 and ti. The mean migration velocity  was calculated according to the expression:The Euclidian distance dE for each cell was calculated as the length of the straight line between the cell start point (x(t1), y(t1)) and the end point(x(tN), y(tN)):The accumulated distance dA for each cell is the result of the sum of all incremental movements measured in between consecutive images:The directness, which represents a measure of the cell's tendency to travel in a straight line, is calculated as the ratio of the Euclidian distance and the accumulated distance.A directness of D\u200a=\u200a1 indicates a straight-line migration from the start point to the end point.Statistical analysisAt least three independent experiments were performed for each protocol. The two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare means of two different groups; ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test were used to study differences of means of multiple samples. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.ResultsCharacterization of isolated fibroblastsImmunocytochemically characterized populations of the isolated mammary fibroblasts (normal dermal and cancer-associated) stained uniformly for vimentin, but resulted negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31, confirming the stromal origin of cells and the absence of contaminating epithelial or endothelial elements. As reported in literature, approximately 10\u201312% of the CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, while among the NF population only very few elements showed \u03b1-SMA immunoreactivity, probably induced by the culture condition (i.e. 2D cultures) (data not shown). Morphologically, NFs in culture showed the typical spindle-shape fibroblast-like appearance (Figure 1A), while CAFs exhibited a more irregular and flattened morphology (Figure 1B).Morphology of isolated normal and tumor-derived fibroblasts.Light microscopic view showing the different morphology of fibroblasts isolated from human healthy mammary skin (A) or human breast cancer (B) samples after 6 days of culture. Original magnification, \u00d7200.Spatial distribution of tumor/fibroblast cells in 3D co-culturesRepresentative cytokeratin-stained sections from tumor/fibroblast nodule co-cultures (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs, MDA-MB-231/NFs, MDA-MB-231/CAFs) at day 6 are shown in Figure 2, indicating the spatial distribution of tumor cells (stained with the epithelial marker cytokeratin) and fibroblasts in this culture model. As expected, in MCF-7/fibroblast cell nodules fibroblasts were concentrated in the central zone leaving a strip of almost pure cancer cells at the periphery of the nodules. In the MDA-MB-231/fibroblast cell co-cultures, a more diffuse distribution of the two cell types was observed. In contrast to the less invasive MCF-7 cells, the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells extensively infiltrated the fibroblast core, particularly in the presence of CAFs.Spatial distribution of breast tumor cells and fibroblasts in nodule co-cultures.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule co-cultures of either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin) monoclonal antibody to identify the reciprocal location of the two cell types (tumor cells and fibroblasts) in the nodule co-cultures. The more invasive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a looser association as compared to MCF-7/fibroblast co-cultures, with various cells infiltrating the fibroblast nodule core (arrows). DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification for upper panels (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs) and lower insets, \u00d7100; original magnification for lower panels (MDA-MB-231/NFs and MDA-MB-231/CAFs), \u00d7200.Similar cell distributions were observed at day 4 (data not shown).Highly invasive and metastatic breast tumor cells induced fibroblast activationThe immunocytochemical analysis for \u03b1-SMA, demonstrated that the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, when co-cultured with CAFs for 6 days, induced a sharp increase in the amount of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements, indicating the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma (Figure 3). The poorly invasive and low metastasizing MCF-7 breast cancer cells were not able to influence \u03b1-SMA expression of tumor-associated fibroblast population (Figure 3). Neither the highly nor the poorly invasive tumor cells were able to induce activation of normal fibroblasts (data not shown). The same results were obtained after 4 days of co-culturing (data not shown).Breast tumor cell induction of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in tumor stroma-derived fibroblasts.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule culture (CAFs) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-\u03b1-SMA monoclonal antibody to verify the effect of breast cancer cells on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. \u03b1-SMA expression was induced in the tumor-associated fibroblast population as a result of the interaction with the more aggressive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating the ability of these cells to promote stroma activation. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200.Cancer-associated fibroblasts exerted a mitogenic effect on breast tumor cellsTo investigate the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on their respective cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA) was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule sections. As shown in Figure 4A, Ki-67 mainly displayed a uniform nuclear staining. A weak cytoplasmic labelling was rarely observed but it did not interfere with the identification of positive nuclei. As expected, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly higher in breast tumor cells co-cultured for 6 days with CAFs compared with control MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures. In fact, the MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion (50%; p<0.001) of Ki67-positive tumor cells compared to MCF-7 cells cultured alone (34.8%) or in the presence of NFs (30.6%) (Figure 4A and 4B). The same CAF-triggered mitogenic effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells as the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells was higher (85%, p<0.001) compared to that of either MDA-MB-231 cell cultures or MDA-MB-231 cell/NF mixed nodules (61.7% and 60.3%, respectively) (Figure 4A and 4B). Mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the growth of both kinds of fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained on 4-day co-cultures and with PCNA, even though a more heterogeneous and less intense nuclear staining was observed (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts but not their normal counterpart exerted mitogenic effect on breast cancer cells.(A) Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells with NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody (MIB-1 clone) to verify the reciprocal effect of the two cell types on their respective growth rate. The MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in MCF-7 cell/NF or MCF-7 cell nodules. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells and fibroblasts showed the same behavior as observed for MCF-7 cell/fibroblast nodule co-cultures.. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200. (B) Quantitative representation of the immunohistochemical data. Three sections, obtained from 3 different nodules, were analyzed by two independent observers. The number of Ki67-positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD (error bars). Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test, *p<0.001.Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced E- and N-cadherin expression in breast tumor cellsTo test the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on the respective adhesiveness, a confocal immunofluorescence study of E- and N-cadherin expression was performed on nodule sections. The basal level of E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells is shown (Figure 5A) and quantified (Figure 5E). The analysis demonstrated the ability of NFs to induce E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells after 6 days of co-culture, when a great increase in signal intensity (\u223c2.5-fold, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures, Figure 5B, 5C and 5E) was observed. On the other hand, a CAF-triggered down-regulation of the adhesion molecule (\u223c80%, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures) was seen (Figure 5D and 5E). An increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, as the result of a 6-day long interaction with both kinds of epithelial cancer cells (up to \u223c180%, compared with CAF homotypic cultures). CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells (\u223c60%, compared with MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures). CAF-induced N-cadherin expression was found in the N-cadherin-negative MCF-7 cells. NFs were not able to influence N-cadherin expression in cancer cells, neither were they affected by tumor cells (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts and their normal counterpart affected E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells.Frozen nodule sections from MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures (A) or MCF-7 cell/fibroblast mixed cultures (B and D) were processed for E-cadherin immunostaining (Cy3: red). DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining (blue) (C). Confocal images show the up-regulation of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cell population co-cultured with NFs (B) as compared to the MCF-7 homotypic culture (A). On the contrary, interaction with CAFs promoted a strong reduction in E-cadherin expression (D). A representative experiment of three is shown. (E) F (a.u.), fluorescence intensity (in arbitrary units). Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.For all the cell types similar results were obtained with 4-day co-cultures (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts induced vimentin expression in breast tumor cellsAs shown in Figure 6, the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin was clearly induced in the relatively well-differentiated breast cancer cells (MCF-7) co-cultured with CAFs. An up-regulation of the protein was observed in the poorly differentiated, mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells. NFs did not affect the expression of the marker in cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT in breast tumor cells.Western blot analysis revealed that the vimentin protein expression was clearly induced in the low-invasive MCF7 cell line co-cultured with CAFs. Vimentin levels were increased in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs as compared with the control (MDA-MB-231 cells cultured alone). No effect on vimentin expression was found in breast tumor cells co-cultured with NFs.Breast tumor cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced cell membrane fluidityThe impact of fibroblast/tumour cell interplay on the respective plasma membrane lipid packing density was studied by means of a widely used membrane fluorescent probe (Laurdan), an amphiphilic molecule whose fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to the microenvironment polarity and viscosity. As a result of a 6-day interaction between tumor cells and fibroblasts in 2D co-cultures, a significant enhancement of both MCF-7 (Figure 7A and 7B) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 8A and 8B) cell membrane fluidity, demonstrated by reduction in GP values, was observed in the GP images and quantified within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample. On the other hand, the poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 7A and 7B). After 6 days of co-culture, the GP values of MCF-7 cells and CAFs became nearly the same (GP\u223c0.30). Interestingly, this value corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of MCF-7 cells alone (GP\u223c0.34) and CAFs alone (GP\u223c0.26). As a result of MCF-7/NF interaction, the same phenomenon occurred (Figure 7A and 7B): the GP value of MCF-7 cells and NFs is again the same (GP\u223c0.32) and corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of control MCF-7 homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.34) and control NF homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.28).Low invasive breast cancer cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced their plasma membrane fluidity.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MCF-7) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MCF-7 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.Highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells underwent a plasma membrane fluidity increase when co-cultured with normal or cancer-associated fibroblasts.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MDA-MB-231) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on plasma membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity, while MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.On the contrary, the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231cells left unchanged the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 8A and 8B).Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced migration velocity and directness of breast tumor cellsTo test whether fibroblast/cancer cell interactions could influence specific aspects of the cell migratory behaviour, such as velocity and directness, we used single cell tracking of living cells and time-lapse confocal microscopy. We obtained representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (Figure 9A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. As shown in Figure 9B, migration velocity was significantly increased in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with NFs () or CAFs (), compared with control MCF-7 homotypic cultures. CAFs seemed to be more efficacious than NFs in promoting this effect which was also associated with an increase in directness of MCF-7 cell movements (Figure 9A, 9B and 9C). The same effects were obtained when the more invasive MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with fibroblasts (Figure 9D, 9E and 9F). On the other hand, the presence of breast cancer cells did not affect the migratory ability of either NFs or CAFs (data not shown).Breast tumor cells displayed increased migration velocity and directness in vitro due to their interaction with fibroblasts.Representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. Cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with the CellTracker Green CMFDA. The starting point of each cell trajectory is plotted at the center of the graph. A significant increment of migration velocity (in \u00b5m/min) of MCF-7 (B) or MDA-MB-231 (E) cells was induced by the interaction with both CAFs and NFs. A marked enhancement of the tumor cell migration directness was promoted by CAFs in MCF-7 (A, D) or MDA-MB-231 (C, F) cells. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.DiscussionThe influence of the surrounding stromal environment on breast cancer cell behaviour has been widely recognized but the parameters involved and their relationship are still far from being fully elucidated. Defining the differences between the so called reactive stroma of breast tumors and the normal stroma in terms of their influence on tumor cell migratory/invasive properties is therefore of great interest to deepen the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible of cancer progression and metastasis. In this paper, we used conventional 2D monolayer or 3D cultures to investigate the reciprocal influence occurring between breast cancer cells with different degree of differentiation/invasiveness and fibroblasts derived from breast cancer stroma (CAFs) or their normal counterpart (NFs) on some structural and functional features strongly correlated with the invasive/metastasizing phenotype. We found an overall migration/invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both low and highly invasive mammary cancer cells, as demonstrated by their ability to increase tumor cell growth, promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reduction of cell adhesion, enhancement of membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness. These effects were not found or were less intense when cancer cells were grown with NFs under the same experimental conditions. Notably, NFs seem to favour the maintenance of the normal tissue architecture strongly promoting E-cadherin expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that in these experimental models CAFs are able to interact with cancer cells and modulate their migratory behaviour with a greater efficiency, if compared to NFs.In regard to the effect of tumor cell/stroma interaction on cell growth, cohabiting with CAFs induced a clear mitogenic response in both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells, in agreement with previous studies. The MCF-7 cell/CAF and MDA-MB-231/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion of Ki67- or PCNA-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in the homotypic cultures as well as in the mixed nodule sections of tumor cells and NFs. Even though mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the fibroblast growth, the more invasive and metastatic ones promoted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This effect was revealed by the sharp increase in the percentage of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements found in the CAF population co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells which indicates the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma activation. Consistent with data by other authors, these findings suggest that \u03b1-SMA expression in stromal fibroblast (fibroblast activation in tumor stroma) is influenced by the interacting cancer cell type.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterizes progression of many types of carcinomas. Changes in intercellular adhesions mediate this switch and dictate the cell receptivity towards signals from the extracellular milieu. In particular, down-regulation or loss of the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin represents a key step in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype for many tumors. This event is frequently associated with the up-regulation of the mesenchymal adhesion protein N-cadherin, strongly influencing cell motility. Indeed, N-cadherin was shown to be expressed in the most invasive and dedifferentiated breast cancer cell lines and its exogenous expression in malignant cells induces a motile scattered phenotype also enabling circulating tumor cells to associate with stromal and endothelial cells at distant sites. A significant result of the present study is NFs' ability to induce a strong E-cadherin enhancement in MCF-7 cells, demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on frozen nodule sections. This result disagrees with recent findings by Gao et al., who described a NF-triggered down-regulation of E-cadherin in the same tumor cells by Western blot analysis. On the other hand, consistent with data from these authors, we observed a CAF-triggered reduction of this adhesion molecule. For the first time, in our experience an increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, but not in NFs, as the result of the interaction with both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells. CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells and, as previously reported, its de novo expression in MCF-7 cells. The EMT-promoting activity of CAFs, demonstrated by their ability to trigger \u201ccadherin switching\u201d, was corroborated by the induction of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in the well differentiated MCF-7 cells and its up-regulation in the highly dedifferentiated MDA-MB-231 cells. It is conceivable that these CAF-promoted molecular changes of the tumor cell phenotype could have relevant implications in cancer progression and metastasis, not only promoting invasiveness, but also enabling interactions between tumor cells and the N-cadherin-expressing elements of the surrounding microenvironment, also in metastatic niches.Changes in the motional freedom of lipids and protein molecules in the cellular membrane represent a critical feature of pathological cells, influencing several aspects of their behaviour such as the response to chemotherapeutic agents, availability or activation of membrane receptors, migratory, invasive and/or metastatic potential. Even though no univocal trend is evident regarding the direction of alterations in tumor cell membrane fluidity, in most tumors malignant cell membranes have been found to possess higher fluidity than those of their healthy counterparts. It has also been shown that such structural change significantly correlates with an increased migratory/invasive aptitude and malignant potential of tumor cells as well as with a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the present study, two-photon microscopy imaging of cells labelled with the membrane fluorescent probe Laurdan was used to investigate whether fluidity changes in plasma membranes could occur as a result of tumor cell/fibroblast co-culturing. For the first time, we showed that such heterotypic interaction determined a significant enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, the more differentiated and poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density whose significance remains to be elucidated.Cell adhesion, changes in membrane phase properties and migration are complex and inter-dependent cellular processes, whose alterations characterize EMT and lead to the acquisition of a more motile phenotype by cancer cells, allowing for tumour invasion and dissemination.Hence, we finally studied the reciprocal influences of stromal and cancer cells on their respective migratory ability. The interaction of both poorly and highly invasive mammary cancer cells with NFs or CAFs determined a definite increment in tumor cell migration velocity. As expected, this migration-promoting activity was particularly noticeable for CAFs which were able to induce even a marked enhancement of the migration directness of breast tumor cells. On the other hand, no influence of breast cancer cells on the fibroblast migratory ability was detected. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence of the ability of fibroblasts residing in breast tumor stroma to promote both speed and directness of cancer cell migration. In addition, they support results obtained from membrane fluidity analysis.Directional persistence, indicating the existence of a preferential cell track for migration, is an important component of cell motility controlled by multiple factors which include topography of the extracellular environment as well as intrinsic cell properties. It seems conceivable that stroma-induced alterations in specific tumor cell processes, such as cytoskeletal organization, integrin-mediated cell/substratum adhesion or intracellular force creation, have a part in triggering such effect. Future efforts will need to elucidate the CAF-mediated processes that drive tumor cells to migrate on preferential tracks.In summary, our study provides a further insight into the mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression, revealing novel aspects of the reciprocal interactions occurring between malignant cells and the neighbouring fibroblast population. In particular, an overall progression- and invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both well- and poorly-differentiated mammary cancer cells was expressed as their ability in inducing structural and functional changes favouring the acquisition of a motile and invasive phenotype. Moreover, the tumor cell-triggered enhancement in N-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA levels of CAFs, together with MCF-7 cell-induced rigidification of fibroblast membrane, seems to reflect the ability of breast cancer cells to induce changes in the stromal cell microenvironment, whose significance deserves to be deepened. Defining the reciprocal influence of CAFs and mammary cancer cells on specific cell properties which promote tumor invasion and shedding light on the molecular mechanisms that subtend these effects may help in identifying new key regulators of breast tumor progression.ReferencesBreast stroma plays a dominant regulatory role in breast epithelial growth and differentiation: implications for tumor development and progressionStromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancerThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationFibroblasts promote breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9 productionMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerRegulation of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma transitionStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionTumor-associated fibroblasts (part II): Functional impact on tumor tissueInduction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in PMC42-LA human breast carcinoma cells by carcinoma-associated fibroblast secreted factorsEpithelial and stromal cathepsin K and CXCL14 expression in breast tumor progressionBreast cancer cells induce cancer-associated fibroblasts to secrete hepatocyte growth factor to enhance breast tumorigenesisCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts activate progesterone receptors and induce hormone independent mammary tumor growth: A role for the FGF-2/FGFR-2 axisGenetic events and the role of TGF\u03b2 in epithelial tumor progressionMalignant breast epithelium selects for insulin-like growth factor II expression in breast stroma: evidence for paracrine functionFibroblast-mediated acceleration of human epithelial tumor growth in vivoReconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissues in micePeripheral lymph node stromal cells can promote growth and tumorigenicity of breast carcinoma cells through the release of IGF-I and EGFTumor-stromal interactions reciprocally modulate gene expression patterns during carcinogenesis and metastasisInfluence of the interaction between nodal fibroblast and breast cancer cells on gene expressionCharacterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro to deconvolute global gene expression profiles in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of co-cultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsA method for three-dimensional coculture of cancer cells combined to any other type of cells maintained organotypicallyJanus-faced liposomes enhance antimicrobial innate immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infectionPE_PGRS30 is required for the full virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosisCalmodulin-dependent kinase IV links Toll-like receptor 4 signaling with survival pathway of activated dendritic cellsLow density lipoprotein misfolding and amyloidogenesisDynamic organization of lymphocyte plasma membrane: lessons from advanced imaging methodsVisualizing lipid structure and raft domains in living cells with two-photon microscopyHeat stress causes spatially-distinct membrane re-modelling in K562 leukemia cellsHigh-resolution imaging of redox signaling in live cells through an oxidation-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteinInvestigation of the spatial distribution of glutathione redox-balance in live cells by using Fluorescence Ratio Imaging MicroscopyCan redox-sensitive fluorescent probes measure intracellular redox potentials?Compartmentalization of the redox environment in PC-12 neuronal cellsNutrient withdrawal rescues growth factor-deprived cells from mTOR-dependent damageMammalian life-span determinant p66 shcA mediates obesity-induced insulin resistanceControlled self assembly of collagen nanoparticleRole of the life span determinant P66shcA in ethanol-induced liver damageImaging in Cell and Developmental BiologyFeature point tracking and trajectory analysis for video imaging in cell biologyMardia Kanti V, Jupp PE (1999) Directional Statistics.

Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Stroma is composed of vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, and various types of infiltrating immune cells that might interact with each other and tumor cells. In most solid tumors, including breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are predominant cellular elements of the stroma. CAFs constitute a heterogeneous population. Multiple CAF subtypes with separate molecular profiles and different impact on tumor outgrowth have been identified in various types of cancer.Differential expression of markers such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), vimentin (VIM), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is characteristic for CAFs. Nevertheless, these markers are far from being comprehensive or exclusively expressed by these subtypes of cells. Therefore, spindle-shape cell morphology is still a commonly used way to identify CAFs within the tumor stroma. CAFs were shown to promote cancer metastasis, as well as affect angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance via synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and production of growth factors. Thus, CAF-targeting treatment aimed at modifying their number, subtype, or features is a plausible strategy of improving patients\u2019 outcome in the future.Several studies have shown the significance of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in development and progression of different solid tumors. It was demonstrated that stromal expression of \u03b1-SMA correlate with a high number of lymph node metastases and worse clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs also enhanced angiogenesis and influenced tumor growth in\u00a0vivo, and correlated with higher frequency of cancer stem cells. Of note, depletion of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in pancreatic cancer suppressed immune surveillance by increasing CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pancreatic cancer.Here, we aimed to better understand the role of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in BC, with special interest in their impact on tumor growth and dissemination among molecular subtypes. We studied in detail CAF heterogeneity in luminal breast cancer (lumBC) at both the molecular and functional level. Using primary CAFs derived from tumor tissue of patients with lumBC, we demonstrated how heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs might determine tumor growth.MethodsPatientsPrimary tumors of 108 patients with breast cancer (inclusion criteria: nonlobular histology, stage I\u2013III) treated in the University Clinical Centre in Gda\u0144sk, Poland (2011\u20132013), were investigated and described previously. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017), and informed consent was collected from all participants.ImmunohistochemistryPreparation of tissue microarrays (TMA) containing primary breast cancer tissues and staining for ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 were performed as previously described. \u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and EpCAM (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone Ber-EP4, Dako Agilent) were stained and detected with EnVision FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL and OPN staining were performed manually using SNAIL mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 2G11, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA, dilution 1:100) and OPN rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution 1:1600) for 60\u00a0min at room temperature.For \u03b1-SMA, EpCAM, and SNAIL, staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) and percentage (0\u2013100%) of the stained stromal (\u03b1-SMA) or tumor cells (EpCAM, SNAIL) in the total number of stromal or tumor cells, respectively, were determined; index score was calculated as the percentage of positive cells multiplied by intensity, resulting in a score 0\u2013300. For OPN, only the intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) of staining in stroma cells was determined. The overall score corresponding to one patient was established. \u03b1-SMA high status was conferred to samples with index score higher than the upper quartile (Q3) of the whole group.Clinical data analysisKaplan\u2013Meier survival curves presenting overall survival (OS) in patients with low versus high \u03b1-SMA were compared using log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The chi-squared test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine the distribution of \u03b1-SMA protein status among clinicopathological features (stage, grade, lymph node status). Differences in protein levels between groups were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U test. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. All the analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 licensed for the University of Gda\u0144sk.Isolation of CAFs from breast cancerCAFs were isolated from tumor samples of four patients with lumBC (CAF2, CAF3, and CAF4 were isolated from patients with luminal B breast cancer, whereas CAF1 from luminal A) obtained from the Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk (2017\u20132018) after patients\u2019 written informed consent. Each sample (1\u20133\u00a0cm) was collected by an experienced surgeon in aseptic conditions and transferred into DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, GE Healthcare) and antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Tissue sections were stored in 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C and transferred to the Laboratory of Translational Oncology where further processing started no later than 4\u00a0h after resection. Tissue sections were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, minced, and digested enzymatically in 0.35\u00a0mg/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.35\u00a0mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) solution in 1\u00d7 PBS for 1\u00a0h with rotation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Disintegrated tissues were centrifuged at 400g for 5\u00a0min, and the pellet was transferred to a cell culture dish. CAFs were separated using serial trypsinization method. After two to three passages, CAFs were controlled for spindle-shape morphology and presence of CAFs markers VIM and \u03b1-SMA, and absence of tumor marker E-cadherin (E-cad).Cell culturePrimary CAFs were cultured in DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, GE Healthcare) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2. MCF7 (HTB-22), T47D (CRL-2865), and BJ (CRL-2522) cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For all cell lines, the same batch of FBS was used. Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cultures of isolated CAFs and fibroblast cell line, BJ. When cells reached 80% confluency, the medium was changed, and conditioned medium was collected after 72\u00a0h.CAF characterizationImmunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on sterilized cover glass and after 24\u00a0h were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol\u2013acetone mix for 15\u00a0min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent) and incubated with cells for 30\u00a0min. Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:1000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA, dilution 1:2000) antibody was used for CAF characterization. As secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 594 and anti-mouse IgG DyLight 488 were used (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; dilution 1:2000). Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).Western blotCell lysate was prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich), then protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated using 12% polyacrylamide TGX gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad). Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:2000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, dilution 1:500) antibodies were used for detection. Appropriate, secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies were used (Sigma Aldrich, dilution 1:100,000).ELISAOsteopontin concentration (ng/ml) in CAFs and BJ-CM was evaluated using human osteopontin (OPN) Quantikine ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Concentration was quantified by measuring the absorption at 450\u00a0nm with a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, USA).3D culture in MatrigelLumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D were used to analyze influence of CAFs and BJ-CM on colony growth in 3D culture (Corning Matrigel). A total of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 tumor cells resuspended in DMEM were mixed with Matrigel 1:1 and placed into 12-well tissue culture plates. Three-dimensional cultures were then covered with CM from CAFs, BJ, and DMEM as a control, exchanged every third day. For experiments aiming at OPN neutralization, OPN-neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) diluted 3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml was used. Tumor-cell colony growth was quantified by measuring the area of at least 40 colonies using Olympus IX83 microscope (10\u00d7 magnification) and ImageJ software. Data were presented as mean relative to DMEM\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. Comparative data were analyzed with the unpaired Student\u2019s t-test using the IBM SPSS statistics software. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant.Multigene expression analysisRNA extractionRNA was isolated from CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were determined using NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA extraction from lumBC samples (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens) was performed as described.nCounter gene expression assayThe CAFs and clinical samples-derived RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300\u00a0ng) was subjected to expression profiling with nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. Analysis of RNA extracted from clinical samples was processed as described. NanoString data processingThe CAFs and clinical samples RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. Data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls included in the assay and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes, 18 (SD range 2.9\u201366.9 counts) and 4 (SD range 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) in the CAFs and clinical samples datasets, respectively. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples\u2009<\u20094 for CAFs dataset and\u2009<\u20096 for FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 320 and 584 transcripts in CAFs and FFPE dataset, respectively. Genes differentiating between \u03b1-SMAhigh and \u03b1-SMAlow samples were selected on the basis of log2 fold change (log2FC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in compared groups. Genes with log2FC\u2009>\u20091 were considered upregulated; genes with log2FC\u2009<\u2009\u22121 were considered downregulated in the \u03b1-SMAhigh group.Results\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs are associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in patients with lumBC\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs correlate with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in lumBC.

Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied\u03b1-SMA was evaluated immunohistochemically in fibroblast-like stromal cells of 108 nonmetastatic primary breast tumors (Fig.\u00a01A). Staining was informative for 106 tumors, all of which showed expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs; importantly, there were considerable differences in the percentage of positive cells (5\u201390% cells of fibroblast-like morphology) and staining intensity (moderate in 31.7%, high in 68.3% of samples; no weak staining was observed).For further analysis, patients were divided into two groups, \u03b1-SMAlow (n\u2009=\u200993) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (n\u2009=\u200913), according to the upper quartile of the \u03b1-SMA staining index (equal 240). The distribution of \u03b1-SMA status in CAFs (low versus high) was compared with clinicopathological data, including dissemination status, and molecular data. There was no correlation between \u03b1-SMA level and stage, grade, lymph node status, or circulating tumor cell (CTC) presence and phenotype (Additional file 1: Table S1) in the whole analyzed cohort.Interestingly, only in the lumBC group, patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs had significantly poorer overall survival rate (p\u2009=\u20090.019, log-rank; Fig.\u00a01B). However, no further correlations with clinicopathological data or dissemination status were found in this subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S2). In terms of molecular markers evaluated immunohistochemically, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated positively with SNAIL (p\u2009=\u20090.034) and EpCAM (p\u2009=\u20090.016) protein levels (Fig.\u00a01C), pointing to more aggressive phenotype, while no correlation was observed for other previously characterized proteins, i.e., SLUG, CXCR4, and TWIST (data not shown).\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs increase outgrowth of breast cancer cell linesCharacterization of CAFs isolated from patients with BC.

The values presented are mean\u00a0\u00b1\u2009SD from three independent experiments (n\u2009=\u20092 technical replicates). Unpaired Student\u2019s t-test test was applied, ***p\u2009<\u20090.0001 calculated versus control (DMEM)To confirm adverse effect of \u03b1-SMA CAFs on lumBC, CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094) were isolated from primary lumBC tissue specimens and tested on their impact on breast cancer cell lines in\u00a0vitro. After three passages, isolated CAFs were analyzed for the presence of CAF- and tumor-related markers by immunofluorescent staining and western blot along with BJ normal fibroblasts and MCF7 cell line serving as controls. All obtained CAF cell lines stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-cad and presented spindle-shape morphology typical for fibroblasts (Additional file 2: Fig. S1A, B). On the basis of the \u03b1-SMA immunofluorescence staining, CAF cell lines were classified as \u03b1-SMAhigh (CAF3 and CAF4), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200990%), or \u03b1-SMAlow (CAF1 and CAF2), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-negative cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200980%) (Fig.\u00a02A).CM collected from the established CAFs was applied to lumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D in 3D Matrigel assay. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs significantly increased MCF7 cells colonies growth in Matrigel (colony area fold change compared with control equaled 2.16 for \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs versus 4.16 for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, p\u2009=\u20090.0001) (Fig.\u00a02B, C). Similar observations were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).As these results suggested that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM promote cancer cell proliferation, we analyzed phosphorylation of two nodal proteins governing pathways activating cell proliferation, AKT and ERK. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression and phosphorylation of those proteins when MCF7 cells were cultured in 2D and treated with CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh or \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs (data not shown).Since in clinical material \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated with higher expression of SNAIL and EpCAM, we performed qPCR expression analysis of these genes in lumBC cell lines treated with CAFs CM. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells (data not shown).Osteopontin is expressed and secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-secreted osteopontin increases tumor growth.

G Ki67 percentage in patients with different OPN staining intensity\u2014negative to moderate (neg-to-mod) and strong, evaluated immunohistochemically. Mann\u2013Whitney U test was appliedTo identify the potential mechanism accounting for promotion of tumor growth by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, multigene expression analysis of four isolated CAF cell lines (two \u03b1-SMAhigh versus two \u03b1-SMAlow) was performed using nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString). Differential gene expression analysis identified 29 genes that were upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091, i.e., ITGB2, TNFSF4, CXCL6, VCAM1, and OPN) in \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs. They are, e.g., linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, as revealed by Gene Ontology analysis. In turn, downregulation was noted for 25 genes (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121, i.e., NFATC2, MASP1, KIT, IL17RB, and CXCL14) involved in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a03A, Additional file 4: Table S3).Then we examined whether the same differences in genes expression were observed in clinical tissue samples from patients with \u03b1-SMAlow versus \u03b1-SMAhigh lumBC. To highlight the most significant differences between those two groups, scores lower than the lower quartile (Q1) of index score were considered as \u03b1-SMAlow, whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh status was claimed for tissues with scores above the upper quartile (Q3). Only one gene, OPN, was significantly upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091), and five genes, HLA-DPB1, MS4A1, IL6, CMA1, and REL, were downregulated (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121) in patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh (Fig.\u00a03B, Additional file 4: Table S4). Here no interactions were revealed.Interestingly, OPN was the only gene demonstrating upregulation both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor samples of lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs. Consequently, we assessed the secretion of OPN by CAFs in\u00a0vitro. ELISA assay indeed revealed significantly higher level of OPN protein in the CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs (FC 4; p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03C).In accordance with this observation, when analyzed immunohistochemically in the lumBC tissue material, OPN protein was present in CAF cytoplasm and their surrounding in 51% of samples, mostly scored as weak\u20141 (41.8%), moderate\u20142 (38.1%), and strong\u20143 (20.1%) staining (Fig.\u00a03D). Strong OPN staining was observed in 20% (21/108) of \u03b1-SMAhigh samples when analyzed in individual tumor fragments. OPN expression was also noted in cancer cells, as cytoplasmic or nuclear staining (in 30% and 19% of lumBC samples, respectively). Although in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis OPN-positive fibroblasts were reported to accumulate in perivascular spaces, such pattern was not observed in the analyzed breast tumors.OPN secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induces lumBC cell colony growthTo further assess the functional significance of CAFs-delivered OPN in lumBC, we performed 3D Matrigel assay. MCF7 and T47D cells were cultured in Matrigel and incubated with different CAF- or BJ-derived CM supplemented or not with OPN-neutralizing antibodies. We observed that addition of OPN-neutralizing antibody decreased colony growth of MCF7 in Matrigel only in cells treated with CM derived from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (colony area fold change compared with control 4.16 for CAFs CM without OPN-neutralizing antibodies versus 2.87 for CM CAFs with OPN-neutralizing antibodies, p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03E, F). In case of CM from \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs and BJ cell line, the area of colonies remained unchanged (Fig.\u00a03E, F). Similar results were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). In accordance with this observation, OPN strong CAF-associated staining correlated positively with the higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells assessed immunohistochemically in clinical samples (lumBC, p\u2009=\u20090.012, Fig.\u00a03G).DiscussionTME and its components such as CAFs play an important role in breast cancer progression. In this study, CAFs were classified according to the presence of \u03b1-SMA protein, and their impact on lumBC was investigated in the context of this marker both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. We showed for the first time that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs might stimulate growth of lumBC cancer cells by secreting OPN.We demonstrated heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in intratumoral CAFs in primary breast cancers. We found that high level of this marker in CAFs was associated with poor prognosis in patients with lumBC. Even though there are studies that link \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs with worse clinical outcome in breast cancer or specifically in TNBC subtype, we report this correlation in lumBC for the first time.\u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs could potentially influence patients\u2019 outcome by induction or regulation of more aggressive phenotype of cancer cells (characterized, e.g., by increased proliferation, stemness, or epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, EMT). In line, CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induced the outgrowth of lumBC cell lines in\u00a0vitro in 3D cultures. However, no induction of phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, proteins involved in cell proliferation, was observed in MCF7 cell line when \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM was used. This could mean that another signaling pathway was involved or \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u2019 positive effect on cancer cell growth occurs only in 3D cultures that more accurately reflect the conditions of tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. In our cohort of patients with lumBC, significantly higher level of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and SNAIL were found in \u03b1-SMAhigh tumors. In breast cancer, EpCAM is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in the luminal and basal-like molecular subtypes. There are limited studies correlating CAFs with EpCAM, yet Eberlein et\u00a0al. demonstrated that tumor cells (non-small-cell lung cancer) with high expression of EpCAM activate CAF-like phenotype in normal fibroblasts through avb6/TGF\u03b2 signaling. Thus, potential interaction between EpCAM-positive breast cancer cells and \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs should be investigated in the future. In case of SNAIL, this transcriptional factor is essential for EMT and induces tumor cell invasion. It has been reported that SNAIL level is upregulated in tumor cells by CAFs in breast cancer. Interestingly, EpCAM could also contribute to the TGF\u2010\u03b21-induced EMT in lumBC cell line, MCF-7. Thus, in our study, elevated EpCAM and SNAIL in tumor cells of patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may possibly induce EMT, resulting in increased motility of those cells and giving rationale for worse clinical outcome of those patients. Nevertheless, we did not confirm induction of EMT by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs in\u00a0vitro (data not shown). CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells. Such results may be due to performing experiments in 2D culture or EMT induction by those CAFs not being dependent on secretome but rather dependent on direct contact of interacting cells.To dissect putative factors accounting for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-mediated induction of lumBC cell outgrowth and worse prognosis, we analyzed their transcriptome both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. Gene expression revealed that genes upregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (i.e., IL6, IL1B, ITGB2, ICAM1) were linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, which was previously described by our team as EMT-promoting mechanism in breast cancers. In turn, genes downregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh isolated CAFs (e.g., CD40, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF1B, PSMB9) were implicated in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway. Interestingly, only OPN was upregulated both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor tissue samples from lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs.OPN is a secreted, integrin-binding phosphoprotein involved in carcinogenesis. Of note, most studies report on tumor-derived OPN, and little is known about OPN secreted by CAFs. OPN secreted by tumor cells induced expression of CAF-associated markers (\u03b1-SMA and VIM) in mesenchymal stromal cells through upregulation of TGF-\u03b21. It also plays a key role in reprogramming normal mammary fibroblasts to proinflammatory, tumor-promoting CAFs. In breast cancer, elevated expression of OPN was firstly identified in stroma from patients with poor outcome and in CAFs from MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse model. We observed positive OPN staining in cancer cell cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly OPN was present in CAF cytoplasm and surroundings. Here we showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-derived OPN enhances tumor growth, and this process may be inhibited by OPN-neutralizing antibodies. In our clinical samples, CAF-associated OPN (i.e., OPN found in cytoplasm and/or in surrounding of CAFs) correlated also with the higher percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells, which would stay in accordance with lumBC cell outgrowth depending on \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs-derived OPN-induced tumor outgrowth. One of the previously proposed mechanisms of how stroma-derived OPN impacts cell proliferation and survival was involvement of CD44 and activation of MAPK cascade. Whether the regulation of OPN in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs is through one of the known pathways has yet to be determined.ConclusionsWe showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlate with worse prognosis in lumBC and might be associated with more aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells (e.g., EMT-related phenotype and/or increased proliferation). OPN secretion might be one of the mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon. However, the other mechanisms accounting for adverse impact of \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs on lumBC merit further investigation.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblasts\u03b1-SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinlumBCLuminal breast cancerCMConditioned mediumOPNOsteopontinBCBreast cancerTMETumor microenvironmentFAPFibroblast activation proteinVIMVimentinFSP1Fibroblast-specific protein 1PDGFRPlatelet-derived growth factor receptorECMExtracellular matrixEpCAMEpithelial cell adhesion moleculePublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsConceptualization, A.M., N.B.-K., and A.J.Z.; methodology, A.M., A.N., M.P., M.N., and N.B.-K.; formal analysis, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; investigation, A.M., A.N., M.P., and J.S.; resources, J.S., J.Z., A.M., and A.J.Z.; data curation, A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.M. and N.B.-K.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; visualization, A.M. and J.Sz; supervision, N.B.-K. and A.J.Z.; project administration, A.J.Z.; funding acquisition, A.J.Z.

Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.IntroductionThe cooperative interactions among tumor cells and reactive stroma strongly contribute to cancer development and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been indicated as the main cellular component of the tumor microenvironment involved in cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. In breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics through multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of new blood vessels, mainly generated by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Indeed, mechanisms of cell sensing and adaptation to stressful environments are activated within the hypoxic tumor mass, leading to the growth and aggressiveness of malignant cells. The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) primarily mediates the cell responses to a low oxygen tension playing a crucial role in cancer development. In particular, HIF-1 activates a signaling transduction network which drives the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of the hypoxia-inducible \u03b1 subunit and the constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 dimerize upon exposure to hypoxia, generating a complex which binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of target genes. In this regard, it has been shown that HIF-1 is a leading regulator of tumor angiogenesis following hypoxia, as it regulates the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors, like the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Recently, we discovered a further HIF-1-regulated gene, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), which contributes to the adaptation to a low oxygen environment in breast cancer cells and in cardiomyocytes. In particular, we found that the cooperation between GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 upon exposure to hypoxia leads to the up-regulation of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which is a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER. Surprisingly, we also assessed that in CAFs derived from breast cancer malignancies GPER acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. On the basis of these data, GPER-mediated functions may be included among the mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment.Considering that hypoxia regulates HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of both GPER and VEGF in different model systems, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential involvement of GPER in the expression and function of VEGF in CAFs and breast cancer cells. In this regard, we demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates the up-regulation of VEGF as well as the endothelial tube formation, suggesting that this transduction pathway may be involved in the intricate stimulatory responses to hypoxia within the cancer stroma. Our data may open new perspectives towards innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the breast cancer microenvironment.Materials and methodsReagentsCobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Srl (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) was obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). Human CTGF was purchased from MBL International Corporation, distributed by Eppendorf, (Milan, Italy). Human VEGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC, CTGF and VEGF, which were solubilized in water.Ethics statementAll procedures conformed to the Helsinki Declaration for the research on humans. The experimental research has been performed with the ethical approval provided by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital in Cosenza, Italy.Cell culturesThe SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The murine cardiomyocyte-like cell line HL-1 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA). In particular, the HL-1 cell line was established from a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor excised from an adult female Jackson Laboratory-inbred C57BLy6J mouse (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). HL-1 cells were cultured according to the published protocol in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Bioscience, Sigma-Aldrich Srl), 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 0.1 mM norepinephrine (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). All cell lines were grown in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were treated with CoCl2 or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) in a HeraCell incubator (ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy). Cells were switched to medium without serum the day before experiments.Isolation, cultivation and characterization of CAFsCAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies as previously described. Signed informed consent from all the patients and IRB approval were obtained. In particular, tissues obtained were cut into smaller pieces (1 to 2 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for two minutes. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485 \u00d7 g for eight minutes, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham's F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) and cultured at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. In each patient, a second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. We used CAFs and fibroblasts passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. Primary cells cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001), all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy). In order to assess fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All experiments were performed in each CAF population obtained from six patients. Data presented were obtained in CAFs derived from one patient; however, results similar to those shown were found in CAFs derived from the other five patients.Gene reporter assaysThe 2.6 kb VEGF promoter-luciferase construct containing full-length VEGF promoter sequence (22,361 to +298 bp relative to the transcription start site) used in luciferase assays was a kind gift from Dr. Pal Soumitro (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). CAFs or SkBr3 cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u03bcL/well culture medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 h with control shRNA, shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER. Next, a mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was transfected within cells. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). After 8 h, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed to low oxygen (2% O2) for 12 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) normalized to the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as one-fold induction, from which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.Gene expression studiesTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not degraded and showed clear 18S and 28S bands under ultraviolet light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected genes was quantified by both real-time RT-PCR using Step One\u00ae sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Milan, Italy) and semiquantitative RT-PCR.

Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to the Bradford method. Cell lysates (10 to 50 \u03bcg of protein) were electrophoresed through a reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary polyclonal IgG antibody for HIF-1\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Celbio, Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), CTGF (L-20), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), \u03b2-actin (C2), b-tubulin (H-235-2) and appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA). The levels of proteins and phosphoproteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and revealed using the ECL\u00ae System (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).Gene silencing experimentsCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected for 24 h before treatments with a control vector or an independent shRNA sequence for each target gene using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics). The shRNA plasmid for HIF-1\u03b1 and the respective control plasmids were purchased from SABioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA). The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by the construct which we have previously described and used.Immunofluorescence microscopyFifty percent confluent cultured CAFs, SkBr3 and HL-1 cells grown on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed for 12 h to low oxygen tension (2% O2). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments, cells were previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids (as described above) and then treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, or cultured under hypoxia as indicated. Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging System supported by quantification and image processing software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (Leica Microsystems CMS, GbH Mannheim, Germany) were used for experiment evaluation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCAFs were grown in 10-cm dishes to 60 to 70% confluence, serum deprived for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, USA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primer for the -1,216 to -883 region of the human VEGF promoter containing the HRE site is 5'-CACAGACCTTCACAGCCATC-3' (forward hHRE) and 5'-CCCAGCGTAGACAGTTGAGT-3' (reverse hHRE). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation. For knockdown experiments CAFs were previously transfected in serum-free medium for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and the respective control shRNA (as described above) and then treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2.Migration assayMigration assays were performed with CAFs in triplicate using Boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8 mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich Srl). CAFs were transfected with shRNA constructs directed against HIF-1\u03b1, GPER or with an unrelated control shRNA construct in regular growth medium. After 24 h, cells were exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 6 h in medium without serum. Then, cells were maintained for 24 h in normoxic conditions (20% O2) in medium without serum. This experimental condition has been designed in order to reproduce the unbalanced oxygenation occurring within solid tumors, where the irregular blood flow is responsible for hypoxia and reoxygenation phases. CAFs were, therefore, trypsinized and seeded in the upper chambers. CTGF (100 ng/mL) was added to the medium without serum in the bottom wells where applicable. Six hours after seeding, cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed and counted.Conditioned mediumCAFs were cultured in regular growth medium to 80% confluence. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with shHIF-1\u03b1, shGPER or control shRNA using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions for 12 h. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in HUVECs.Protein precipitation with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)Conditioned medium from CAFs (see above) was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and 10 \u03bcg/mL BSA (final concentration) was added as a control for precipitation efficiency. TCA (100% solution) was added to a final concentration of 20% to conditioned media. After a 20-minute incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 31,000 g for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C). Pellets were washed with cold acetone, centrifuged at 31,000 g for 30 minutes (4\u00b0C), air dried and resuspended in protein lysis buffer (described above). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford Method and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using 100 \u03bcg protein/lane.Tube formation assayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37\u00b0C in serum free medium (EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen, Inc., Helgerman Court, Gaithersburg, USA) was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates and left at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Invitrogen), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel\u00ae and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls' testing to determine differences in means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsHypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression in CAFsIn order to provide further insight into the response to hypoxia in main components of the tumor microenvironment like CAFs, we began our study showing that hypoxia induces the mRNA expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene GPER, as ascertained by real time PCR (Figure 1) and semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). In particular, CAFs were treated from 1 h to 24 h with the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2 (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 1a) or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1b). The induction of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mRNA expression was paralleled by increased protein levels of these factors in CAFs treated from 1 h to 24 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 1c) or exposed to a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1d). Next, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the induction of GPER by CoCl2 was abrogated (Figure 1e, Additional file 1a), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in CAFs exposed to hypoxic conditions. In order to assess the transduction signaling involved in the aforementioned responses, we determined the rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation (from 15 minutes up to 60 minutes) following the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 2a). Accordingly, we observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation culturing CAFs in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (Figure 2b). Next, the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 30 minutes in the presence of 300 \u03bcM of the ROS scavenger NAC did not induce the ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). Moreover, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER observed treating CAFs for 3 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 was no longer evident in the presence of 300 \u03bcM NAC and 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor PD (Figure 2d). On the basis of these results, it could be argued that hypoxia-induced ROS may trigger the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is involved in the up-regulation of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression.Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs. (a-d) The exposure to 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a, c) or low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 3 h) (b, d) up-regulate the mRNA (a, b) and protein (c, d) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER as evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In RNA experiments, values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. (e) The up-regulation of GPER observed treating CAFs for 6 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1.

The treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a) or the exposure to low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (b) induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is prevented by using 300 \u03bcM of the free radical scavenger NAC (c). (d) Immunoblots of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER from CAFs treated for 3 h with vehicle (-) or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 alone and in combination with 300 \u03bcM NAC or 10 \u03bcM ERK1/2 inhibitor PD. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to ERK/2 or \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cultured under normoxia vs cells treated with CoCl2 or cells cultured under hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the expression of VEGF induced by hypoxiaConsidering the ability of a low oxygen environment to trigger the production of pro-angiogenic factors in solid tumors, we aimed to evaluate whether hypoxia may promote the expression of an important HIF-1\u03b1 target gene like VEGF. As shown in Figure 3a, the treatment with CoCl2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF in a time-dependent manner in both CAFs and SkBr3 breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in a completely different model system, such as HL-1 cardiomyocytes (Additional file 2). Next, CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) activated a VEGF promoter reporter gene which was transfected in CAFs and SkBr3 cells (Figure 3b, c). Notably, the aforementioned transcriptional response to hypoxia was abrogated knocking-down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 3d, e and Additional file 1c, d). CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) promoted also VEGF protein expression in CAFs, as evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4). The induction of VEGF protein levels was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 5 and Additional file 1a, b), further highlighting their involvement in the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia. Analogously, the up-regulation of VEGF protein expression upon exposure to hypoxia in SkBr3 (Figure 6a) and HL-1 cells (Figure 7a) was no longer evident, knocking down the expression of GPER (Figures 6b and 7b and Additional file 1e) and HIF-1 \u03b1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the regulation of VEGF expression induced by hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF. (a) The mRNA expression of VEGF is up-regulated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as evaluated by real-time PCR. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle (-). Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. (b) The VEGF promoter plasmid (pVEGF) is transactivated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 12 h (b) or exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) for 12 h (c). The transactivation of the VEGF promoter observed in SkBr3 cells treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER expression (e). The luciferase activities were normalized to the internal transfection control and values of cells receiving vehicle or cultured under normoxia were set as one-fold induction upon which the activities induced by CoCl2 treatment or hypoxia were calculated. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Images shown are representative of 20 random fields of three independent experiments.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the VEGF promoter and involved in VEGF-mediated tube formation induced by hypoxiaAs HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are required for the hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, we next determined by ChIP assay that HIF-1\u03b1 (Figure 8a) and GPER (Figure 8b) are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter sequence in CAFs exposed to CoCl2 for 1 h. Interestingly, GPER was required for the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of VEGF, as evidenced knocking-down the expression of GPER (Figure 8c). In parallel, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the recruitment of GPER to the HRE site within the VEGF promoter sequence (Figure 8d). Altogether, these findings suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER leads to the hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence. CAFs treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 were submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (a) or anti-GPER (b) antibodies. For knockdown experiments, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPER (c) or with control shRNA and shHIF-1\u03b1 (d), treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 and then submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (c) or anti-GPER (d) antibodies. The amplified sequences were evaluated by real-time PCR. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle vs CoCl2 treatment.On the basis of these data, we then examined whether conditioned medium from hypoxia-stimulated CAFs could promote in HUVECs the formation of tubule-like structures that represent a useful model system for the evaluation of the neoangiogenesis process. In particular, HUVECs were cultured on GFR-Matrigel\u00ae-coated plates which prevent the formation of capillary-like structures, as previously reported. Notably, HUVECs cultured in normoxic medium from CAFs did not assemble into cord-like structures, while HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs maintained in hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h) displayed a complex ramified network of tubules (Figure 9a). Moreover, in HUVECs cultured with hypoxic medium (2% O2 for 12 h) collected from CAFs, which were previously transfected with a shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER, tube formation was no longer observed (Figure 9b, c). The addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF to the hypoxic medium from GPER-silenced CAFs restored the ability to form tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure 9c). The aforementioned findings were quantified and recapitulated in Additional file 3. Next, we determined that the up-regulation of VEGF protein levels in hypoxic medium from CAFs is no longer evident, knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Additional file 4). Hence, these results clearly suggest that VEGF may be considered as a target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced tube formation. Tube formation was evaluated in HUVECs cultured for 2 h in medium collected from CAFs which were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). To this end, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA (a), shHIF-1\u03b1 (b) or shGPER (c) and exposed to hypoxia, as indicated. Tube formation is rescued in HUVECs treated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and cultured in medium from CAFs transfected with shGPER and cultured under hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). Data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFsIn order to further corroborate the stimulatory role exerted by HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in hypoxic conditions, we turned to a different model system. CoCl2 and low oxygen tension (2% O2) induced CTGF up-regulation at both mRNA (Figure 10a) and protein level (Figure 10b, c) in CAFs. Silencing HIF-1\u03b1 as well as knocking down GPER expression, the up-regulation of CTGF upon CoCl2 was abolished (Figure 10d, e). As a biological counterpart, the migration of CAFs cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2) was prevented, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression and rescued, adding CTGF (Figure 10f). Collectively, our data may suggest that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates different biological outcomes in CAFs exposed to hypoxia.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFs. (a) The mRNA expression of CTGF is induced after the stimulation of CAFs with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as indicated. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. The protein expression of CTGF is induced by 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (b) or low oxygen tension (2% O2, for 4 h) (c). The up-regulation of CTGF protein expression observed upon 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 treatment is abrogated silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER (e) expression. The migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) is prevented knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression. Cell migration is rescued in CAFs transfected with shGPER, exposed to hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) and treated with 100 ng/ml CTGF (f). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.DiscussionIn the present study, we provide novel evidence regarding the regulation of VEGF, which plays a fundamental role in mediating hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In particular, our results demonstrate that a low oxygen tension stimulates through the ERK1/2 transduction pathway the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent expression of GPER, which contributes to the regulation of VEGF in both CAFs and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that following hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter region and cooperatively act as a functional complex for the transcription of VEGF. As a biological counterpart, we evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mediate endothelial tube formation in HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs which were previously exposed to hypoxia. Further corroborating these findings, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER regulates the expression of the migratory factor CTGF, which has been acknowledged as a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.HIF-1 is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and acts as a survival factor in hypoxic tumor environment, mainly activating the transcription of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, oxygen consumption, cell migration and invasion. Besides, hypoxia stimulates through HIF-1 the expression of anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic factors that drastically change the biological properties of tumor cells towards malignant features. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that GPER may be included among the HIF-1 target genes as the up-regulation of GPER induced by hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in breast cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. In particular, GPER-mediated the antiapoptotic effects exerted by estrogens in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the adaptation of cancer cells to a low oxygen environment.GPER may be considered as a predictor of cancer malignancy and aggressiveness considering that its expression has been associated with negative clinical features and poor survival rates in diverse types of tumors. Therefore, huge efforts are currently underway to unravel the mechanisms that rule its regulation and function. Indeed, the development and characterization of drugs that target key players of cancer progression like GPCRs, and particularly GPER, are currently innovative topics under investigation.In this context, estrogenic GPER signaling has been shown to trigger relevant biological effects like proliferation and migration in diverse cancer cells and in CAFs derived from breast tumors. Notably, GPER exhibited the peculiar property to act in CAFs as a transcriptional regulator together with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hence leading to the up-regulation of Cyclin D, which has been largely involved in cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has suggested that CAFs may drive cancer phenotype mainly through a paracrine action exerted by the production of various growth factors and chemokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the stromal contribution to the development of a wide variety of tumors has been supported by animal models of cancer pathogenesis and extensive clinical studies. In this vein, it has been shown that malignant cells recruit into the tumor mass diverse stromal components like CAFs, inflammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate towards cancer progression. In particular, CAFs elicit in breast carcinomas relevant biological activities, including the stimulation of new blood vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth, metastasis and poor prognosis. In this context, our present data add a further mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment may promote angiogenesis, as the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling was shown to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Considering that VEGF is one of the most important factors mediating the complex process of angiogenesis, its action has been widely involved in the development of many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been shown that the ectopic expression of VEGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may promote tumor growth in vivo , whereas the blockade of VEGF has been associated with the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude mice. Thus, given the crucial role exerted by VEGF in tumor development and prognosis, a great deal of interest is currently addressed to a better understanding of its regulation and function. In this regard, VEGF was shown to be regulated by hypoxia mainly through HIF-1\u03b1, which may interact with numerous factors to boost VEGF expression. Further extending the current knowledge on the complex regulation of VEGF, our data suggest that GPER may contribute to the HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional responses in hypoxic tumor microenvironment towards new blood vessel formation. Notably, an increased VEGF production was recently shown to parallel an elevated GPER expression in endometrial cancer patients with low survival rates. These data in combination with our findings may suggest that in estrogen-dependent cancer cells diverse molecular mechanisms could converge on the production of cytokines and growth factors, promoting an enhancement of malignant epithelial growth and invasion through autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Interestingly, we have determined that the up-regulation of VEGF relied on HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling also in HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this transduction mechanism may be implicated in additional pathophysiological conditions, such as the hypoxic myocardium. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective role exerted by GPER in stressful conditions following hypoxia. These data in combination with the results obtained in the present study may indicate that GPER could elicit cardiotropic effects also through its ability to regulate the expression of VEGF, which mainly contributes to adaptive responses following myocardial ischemic injury.As it concerns the signaling cascades activated by hypoxia, we here demonstrate that the ROS-mediated ERK1/2 activation is involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression upon low oxygen tension. In this regard, it should be mentioned that ROS play a relevant role in the biological responses to re-oxygenation; however, decreased oxygen levels may be sufficient to trigger HIF-1-dependent gene expression through the ROS production. In addition, the rapid responses to hypoxia are mediated by multiple transduction pathways activated also upon GPER stimulation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the functional cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER, particularly following both hypoxic and estrogenic stimulations. For instance, estrogens regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression and function in a stressful environment, indicating an intricate cooperation between these two main factors mainly involved in tumor progression. Interestingly, in the current investigation, the biological interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER upon hypoxic conditions was corroborated by the up-regulation of an important migratory stimulator and GPER target gene like CTGF. Accordingly, the migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression, hence confirming their contribution to this relevant cell response.The results obtained in the current study may also disclose a unique ligand-independent action elicited by GPER. This issue could be a further attractive topic which remains to be elucidated in future studies.Altogether, our findings recapitulate in CAFs exposed to hypoxia the engagement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling towards the regulation of pivotal genes involved in angiogenic and metastatic processes. Anyway, further studies are required to better define the role exerted by this transduction pathway in diverse pathophysiological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia through the functional interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.ConclusionsWithin the tumor microenvironment exposed to hypoxia, CAFs have been involved in the generation of new blood vessels which mainly support cancer progression. Our current data highlight the stimulatory role exerted by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the multistep process of tumor neoangiogenesis fostered by CAFs. Considering the crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma, the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway may be pointed out as a further biological target towards innovative treatments in breast cancer.AbbreviationsCAFs: Carcinoma activated fibroblasts; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; DAPI: 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EGM: endothelial growth medium; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAP\u03b1: fibroblast activated protein \u03b1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GPER: G-Protein estrogen receptor; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; HREs: hypoxia-responsive elements; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TCA: trichloroacetic acid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEMDF designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the paper.

        "content": "It is widely recognized that stromal fibroblasts significantly influence biological properties of multiple tumors including breast cancer. However, these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions seem to be essential in tumor biology and it is not fully clear whether this interaction is tumor type-specific or has a more general non-specific character. To elucidate this question, we tested the effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from different types of tumors (breast cancer skin metastasis, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma arising from oral cavity mucous membrane) on the EM-G3 breast cancer cell line. The results were compared with control experiments using normal human dermal fibroblasts, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and 3T3 fibroblasts influenced by the fibroblasts prepared from the basal cell carcinoma. Our results demonstrated that expression of luminal marker keratin 8 was influenced only by CAFs prepared from any tested tumors. In contrast, all tested types of fibroblasts showed a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of basal/myoepithelial marker keratin 14. The CAFs also elevated the number of cells with positivity for both keratins 8 and 14 that are similar to ductal originated precursor cells. The expression of proliferation marker Ki67 was not influenced by any of the tested fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that CAFs are able to influence the phenotype of a breast cancer cell line and this effect is based on a tumor type-unspecific mechanism. Finally, a clear functional difference between normal and CAFs was demonstrated.",

        "content": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Significantly positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue lines, respectively. The color and size of the nodes indicate the type of cells and P values from Cox regression. Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

        "content": "The antiangiogenic extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in animals. However, the clinical relevance of such findings are equivocal as increased stromal TSP-1 expression has been associated with either good or poor prognosis. In an effort to obtain a more integrated understanding of the role of TSP-1 in breast cancer, we first used a breast tumorigenesis model in which tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts were engineered to produce high levels of TSP-1. We demonstrate here that stromal TSP-1 delayed human MDA-MB-231/B02 breast tumor growth. However, this delay in MDA-MB-231/B02 tumor growth upon exposure to TSP-1 was associated with an increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumor cells themselves, leading to a tumor growth rate comparable to that of tumors whose fibroblasts did not overproduce TSP-1. Clinical evidence also suggested that primary breast carcinomas have adapted to escape the effects of stromal TSP-1. TSP-1 was found to be expressed in the stroma of human breast carcinomas where, although its level correlated with decreased vascularization, it was unexpectedly associated with a reduction of relapse-free survival. In metastatic axillary lymph nodes, tumor cells expressed high levels of VEGF and TSP-1 expression were no longer associated with a decreased vascularization. Overall, these results suggest that a resistance may develop early in human breast cancers as a result of high in situ exposure to stromal TSP-1, leading to disease progression.",

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment.

Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability.

        "title": "TGF-\u03b21-activated cancer-associated fibroblasts promote breast cancer invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by autophagy or overexpression of FAP-\u03b1.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the initiation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer. However, whether autophagy acts as a tumor promotion mechanism by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is still controversial and remains undefined at the mechanistic levels. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 is required for the invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT of breast cancer cells and underlying mechanism. We employed an in vitro model of NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub and confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 could convert fibroblasts into CAFs through autophagy under oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Modulation of autophagy by rapamycin, 3-methyladenine or ATG-5 knockdown regulated the expression of CAFs markers, suggesting a role of autophagy in the tumor promotion mechanism of TGF-\u03b21-induced CAFs activation. Furthermore, we established an indirect co-culture model and a mixed xenograft as a corresponding in vivo model. We demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT, which act through autophagy and overexpression of FAP-\u03b1 in both models, while autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked these effects induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Moreover, the co-localization of LC3\u03b2 and EMT marker vimentin in mixed xenograft also revealed that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor growth, pulmonary metastasis, and EMT program partly through autophagy. In addition, knockdown of FAP-\u03b1 resulted in reversed EMT and abolished tumor invasion and pulmonary metastasis induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Taken together, we conclude that both autophagy and FAP-\u03b1 are required for breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Targeting autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 rather than both can serve as a potential approach to improve the prognosis for human breast cancer.",

        "title": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Promotes the Differentiation of Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts, Induced by Breast Cancer Cells.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "title": "The transcription factor Fra-2 promotes mammary tumour progression by changing the adhesive properties of breast cancer cells.",
        "content": "The transcription factor Fra-2 (Fos-related antigen-2) has been implicated in invasion of breast cancer cells, but there is only sparse information about its role in clinical tumours. In the present study, we analysed Fra-2 mRNA expression in a cohort of 167 patients, and found significant correlations between high Fra-2 expression and nodal involvement or reduced disease-free survival. To get more information about the underlying mechanisms, we generated stably transfected MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells with increased Fra-2 expression. Compared with the controls, these clones did not differ in proliferation and motility, but had higher invasive potential. By global gene expression analysis and subsequent validation of selected genes, we identified a number of proteins involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions that were up- or down-regulated in Fra-2 overexpressing cells, e.g. connexin 43, ICAM-1, L1-CAM, integrin beta 2, integrin beta 4, and integrin alpha 6. The association of Fra-2 overexpression and high ICAM-1 or L1-CAM levels could also be demonstrated in our clinical cohort of mammary tumours. In both MDA-MB231 and MCF7 cells, we found an increased attachment of Fra-2 transfectants to components of the extracellular matrix. In addition, we could show a striking increase in the number of rolling cells in flow-through assays using E-selectin coated capillaries, which might indicate a higher capacity of extravasation. In conclusion, our data obtained on breast cancer cell lines and clinical tissue samples suggest that overexpression of Fra-2 promotes breast cancer progression and metastasis by deregulation of genes involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts.",

        "title": "Lipid-Associated Macrophages Are Induced by Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Mediate Immune Suppression in Breast Cancer.",
        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

        "title": "Primary breast myoepithelial cells exert an invasion-suppressor effect on breast cancer cells via paracrine down-regulation of MMP expression in fibroblasts and tumour cells.",
        "content": "In normal breast and ductal carcinoma in situ, myoepithelial cells form an incomplete layer separating the epithelial compartment from the stromal environment. Transition to invasive disease is marked by penetration of the myoepithelial-basement membrane (BM) interface. One mechanism involved in tumour invasion is breakdown of extracellular matrices by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It was hypothesized that myoepithelial cells may modulate tumour invasion by controlling MMP gene expression, both in tumour cells and in peri-ductal fibroblasts. To investigate this, myoepithelial cells from normal breast were purified and characterized and their effect on tumour cell invasive potential was assessed. The effect on MMP gene expression of breast cancer cells cultured alone or in combination with primary normal breast fibroblasts was also analysed using RT-PCR with ELISA quantitation, with zymographic analysis to measure enzyme activity. Normal breast myoepithelial cells significantly reduced invasion by the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB 231, and MDA-MB 468 when they were cultured alone or in the presence of a fibroblast population. Reduced invasion was associated with changes in MMP gene expression. In those tumour cells expressing MMP, there was a significant down-regulation of MMP-2 (MDA-MB 468, p&lt;0.001), MMP-9 (MDA-MB 231, p=0.05; MDA-MB 468, p&lt;0.001), and MT1-MMP (p&lt;0.001 for both MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 468). Myoepithelial cells also caused a significant decrease in MMP gene expression in co-cultured fibroblasts. Furthermore, this was associated with reduced gelatinolytic activity as identified by zymography. This study demonstrates for the first time that primary myoepithelial cells from normal breast reduce breast cancer cell invasion and that this is mediated via modulation of both tumour cell and fibroblast function. This emphasizes the importance of the myoepithelial cell in controlling the breast microenvironment and focuses on the potential significance of the loss of this population with disease progression.",

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

        "content": "Expression of the adhesion molecule L1-CAM (L1) has been shown to correlate with early recurrence in breast cancer. Here, we investigated whether L1-CAM expression of breast cancer cells might influence adherence to human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) and thus promote metastasis. MDA-MB231-Fra2 breast cancer cells that express high levels of L1-CAM (L1(high) cells) were stably transfected to generate clones with strong L1-CAM downregulation. Adhesion to activated HPMEC was studied in dynamic cell flow and static assays. Potential binding partners on endothelial cells were identified by blocking experiments and adhesion assays after coating of the flow channels with recombinant proteins. Adhesion of L1(high) cells to activated HPMEC was significantly higher compared to L1l(ow) clones under flow conditions. Blocking experiments and adhesion assays with recombinant proteins identified activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) or L1 itself, but not ICAM-1, as potential binding partners on endothelial cells. E-selectin blocking antibodies strongly diminished the adherence of breast cancer cells irrespective of their L1-CAM expression. Our experiments indicate that L1-CAM expression on breast cancer cells can promote adherence to activated endothelial cells by binding to endothelial L1-CAM or ALCAM. This mechanism might lead to increased metastasis and a poor prognosis in L1-CAM-positive carcinomas in vivo. Therefore, L1-CAM might be a suitable therapeutic target in breast cancers with a high L1-CAM expression.",

IntroductionBreast cancers (BCs), the most frequent cancers in women, are very heterogeneous solid tumors that can be subdivided into distinct histological and molecular subtypes, linked to different invasive capabilities, sites of metastasis and clinical outcomes. In particular, ductal and lobular BCs represent the most common histological types of invasive BCs. Ductal BCs originate from mammary gland ducts, whereas lobular BCs originate from the lobules of the mammary gland. Furthermore, BCs can be classified into three molecular subtypes depending on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lacking the expression of the three receptors are associated with the worst prognosis. Solid tumors, such as BCs, are constituted by heterogeneous tissues containing cancer cells and an abnormal and dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing tumor development and dissemination. The TME consists of tissue-specific resident and recruited non-cancer stromal cell types, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), blood vessels, lymphatic tumor vessels and the extracellular matrix (ECM). In particular, breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (BCAFs) are the most abundant cell type among non-cancer stromal cells of the breast TME. By interacting with cancer cells, BCAFs contribute to BC growth and metastatic dissemination, which is the most important cause of BC-connected deaths. BCAFs sustain cancer cell migration and invasion by secreting soluble factors such as TGF-\u03b2, HGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), FSP-1, CCL11, CXCL14, CCL-2 and IL-6. Moreover, IL-32 and IL-6 secreted by BACFs induce a cascade of molecular mechanisms associated with metastasis.Over 80% of stromal fibroblasts in BC acquire the activated phenotype of myofibroblasts, which are activated fibroblasts involved in wound healing and inflammatory processes. Therefore, BCAFs exhibit characteristics similar to those of myofibroblasts, such as the up regulation of activation and inflammation markers represented by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). However, unlike myofibroblasts, BCAFs remain in the tumor stroma even if the activated stimuli are reduced. Additionally, CAFs have been described as dangerous travel companions due to their ability to form homotypic and heterotypic cellular aggregates with circulating cancer cells. Circulating cancer cells alone hardly establish secondary tumor growth due to anoikis, literally meaning \u201cwithout home\u201d, which occurs when tumor cells leave the stromal microenvironment of the primary tumor mass. Conversely, CAFs can facilitate the survival and colonization in distant body sites of cancer cells by disseminating through the blood circulation as circulating CAFs or CAF aggregates, with or without cancer cells. Circulating CAFs and CAF aggregates have been identified in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic diseases in breast, lung and prostate cancers. These circulating CAFs and CAF aggregates are promising biomarkers for cancer progression and metastatic disease. However, their role in cancer growth remains poorly analyzed and requires further validations and investigations. The use of tri-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems, such as spheroids, represents a valuable in vitro tool to study the biology and behavior of cancer and non-cancer cells, as well as CAFs, growing as 3D cellular aggregates. In addition, it has been widely recognized that spheroid models possess many hallmarks commonly found in solid tumors. Consequently, 3D cultures are currently used in a broad range of biological studies, including tumor biology, cell adhesion and migration, epithelial morphogenesis, tumor\u2013stroma crosstalk, drug screening and resistance, as well as the development of bio-artificial tissues. In our previous work, we demonstrated that during 3D cell culture, normal human cutaneous myofibroblasts, grown as spheroids, undergo a deactivation process associated with a dramatic down-regulation of both \u03b1-SMA and COX-2 protein expression levels. Furthermore, we also showed that the cells of spheroids, reverted to adhesion growth after 216 h of 3D cell culture, are proto-myofibroblast-like cells which retain an inactivated phenotype in culture, trigger cancer cell death and dramatically inhibit cancer cell migration by paracrine interactions. Therefore, in this work we have developed and characterized an in vitro stromal experimental system constituted by BCAFs grown as monolayers, BCAFs grown as spheroids and so-called reverted BCAFs. Specifically, BCAF monolayers were isolated from invasive breast carcinomas, expressing both the ER and PR. BCAF spheroids, from human primary BCAFs, were collected and analyzed after 72 h and 216 h of 3D cell culture, and reverted BCAFs were obtained from BCAF spheroids reverted to adhesion growth after 216 h of 3D culture. Moreover, we analyzed the paracrine interactions between this stromal cell type and MCF-7 BC cells focusing on the influence of the conditioned media from the BCAF populations on the viability and migration of BC cells. This experimental system could lead to a better understanding of the role of BCAFs growing as monolayers and aggregates on BC cell viability and migration. In addition, this in vitro model can provide the possibility to study and develop a new therapeutic strategy targeting the TME.2. Results2.1. Characterization of Fibroblasts from Normal and Cancer Breast TissuesWe first characterized fibroblasts isolated from surgically resected breast tumors and compared their morphology to fibroblasts isolated from healthy breast tissues. As shown in Figure 1A, the primary fibroblasts from the normal and cancer tissues displayed the typical spindle-like shape.However, the fibroblasts from the normal breast tissues (BNFs) exhibited a thinner, elongated and regular spindle-shaped morphology. Conversely, the primary fibroblasts from the tumor tissue, i.e., BCAFs, had a large and irregular spindle-shaped or stellate-like morphology. These results are consistent with several studies showing that CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) display a different cell morphology. Furthermore, human primary BCAFs and BNFs were analyzed by confocal and western blot analysis, regarding the cytoskeleton organization and \u03b1-SMA protein levels. It is well recognized that CAFs and NFs differ in their cytoskeleton organization and \u03b1-SMA expression levels. Therefore, to analyze the cytoskeleton organization of fibroblasts from normal and cancer tissues, we evaluated the presence of intermediate filaments and stress fibers by vimentin immunofluorescence and phalloidin fluorescence staining, respectively (Figure 1B). The confocal immunofluorescence analysis showed a different pattern of stress fibers in the primary BCAFs and BNFs. In particular, BCAFs displayed more evident and well-developed stress fibers. Conversely, BNFs exhibited fewer, less evident and less organized stress fibers. The vimentin immunofluorescence showed the presence of mesenchymal intermediate filaments in both BCAFs and BNFs, thus confirming their mesenchymal origin. CAFs are described as fibroblasts in a permanent state of activation. The most widely used CAF marker is \u03b1-SMA, which reflects the fibroblast activation state and is more expressed in CAFs than NFs. Of note, fibroblasts in different states of activation are known to affect cancer growth differently. Furthermore, increased \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs correlates with tumor aggressiveness and with a poor overall survival rate in BC patients. Therefore, to evaluate the state of activation of the BCAFs and BNFs, we analyzed \u03b1-SMA protein levels in extracts of the primary BNFs and BCAFs by western blotting analysis (Figure 1C). The densitometric analysis showed that BCAFs expressed significantly higher protein levels of \u03b1-SMA than BNFs (Figure 1D).In addition, we performed a functional characterization of BNFs and BCAFs by testing the effect of their conditioned media on the proliferation and migratory capability of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (Figure 2).Our analysis showed that the conditioned medium from BCAFs significantly increased the viability of MCF-7 cells compared with the conditioned medium from BNFs (Figure 2A). We further demonstrated that BCAF-derived conditioned medium significantly increased MCF-7 cell migration compared with BNF-conditioned medium (Figure 2B). In particular, 48 h after wounding, the quantitative analysis (Figure 2C) showed a percentage of open surface area of about 40% in MCF-7 cells incubated with BNF-conditioned medium, while the scratch area was almost closed in MCF-7 cells treated with BCAF-conditioned medium. Taken together, all these data indicated that we successfully isolated human primary BCAFs with an activated and pro-tumor state.Then, we analyzed, with a Real-Time PCR, the expression of two important CAF markers, such as FAP and SPARC (or osteonectin), in primary BCAFs and paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues (Figure 3).The analysis showed no significant difference between the in vitro primary BCAFs and breast cancer tissues for both FAP and SPARC. Therefore, our in vitro BCAFs can be considered as a valuable and helpful in vitro model that could mimic the in vivo breast TME.2.2. Analysis of Human Primary BCAFs Grown as Monolayers or SpheroidsWe have previously demonstrated that during spheroid formation, normal primary human myofibroblasts undergo a deactivation process, associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA and COX-2 protein expression levels. Furthermore, the fibroblasts of spheroids, reverted to adhesion and monolayer growth, retain in the culture an inactivated phenotype. This is in agreement with other studies showing that myofibroblasts are not terminally differentiated cells and can return to a less activated or quiescent state. Conversely, CAFs are permanently active fibroblasts that are unable to come back to a less activated, quiescent or anti-tumor state in vivo without drug treatments. BCAFs, as well as CAFs from the other solid tumors, are cells in a constitutively activated state associated with high levels of \u03b1-SMA and COX-2 proteins. Furthermore, stromal \u03b1-SMA and COX-2 expression is linked to BC aggressiveness and invasiveness. Therefore, we investigated the molecular and functional profiles of human primary BCAFs isolated from BC patients and grown in vitro as cell monolayers in 2D cultures or aggregates, such as spheroids, in 3D cell cultures. We first generated spheroids of BCAFs upon 72 h and 216 h of a 3D cell culture on agar. Morphology analysis by phase-contrast microscopy showed that BCAF spheroids at both time points had a spherical and regular shape with smooth edges, especially in the spheroids collected at 216 h (Figure 4A).The microscopic evaluation of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the spheroids at 72 h and 216 h showed a prevalence of viable cells and the presence of scattered apoptotic cells. This investigation revealed that there were no significant differences between the percentage of apoptotic and viable cells within the spheroids collected at both time points. (Figure 4B,C). Furthermore, COX-2, vimentin, which is a marker of mesenchymal cells, and \u03b1-SMA immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the paraffin-embedded sections of the BCAF sections collected at 72 h and 216 h (Figure 5A).The analysis showed a weak-to-absent level of staining for COX-2 in the spheroids at 72 h and 216 h, respectively. A moderate immunostaining for \u03b1-SMA was detected in BCAF spheroids at 72 h, while a weak immunostaining for \u03b1-SMA was detected in the spheroids at 216 h. Immunostaining for COX-2 and \u03b1-SMA did not reveal any preferential expression sites. Positive cells for COX-2 and \u03b1-SMA were scattered in the spheroids (Figure 5A). Additionally, the immunohistochemical analysis showed strong and homogeneous immunostaining for vimentin in both the spheroids collected at 72 h and 216 h (Figure 5A). Then, to evaluate and compare the state of activation and inflammation of BCAFs grown in vitro as either 2D cell cultures or 3D cell aggregates, we performed a western blotting analysis of COX-2 and \u03b1-SMA in protein extracts of BCAF monolayers and BCAF spheroids collected after 72 h and 216 h of 3D cell cultures (Figure 5B). This analysis showed that BCAF monolayers expressed both \u03b1-SMA and COX-2 proteins (Figure 5B), confirming their myofibroblast and inflammatory phenotype, which are typical features of CAFs. No significant differences were detected in \u03b1-SMA protein levels between BCAF monolayers and BCAF spheroids at 72 h (Figure 5B,E). Conversely, a dramatic and significant decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was observed in BCAF spheroids collected at 216 h with respect to both BCAF monolayers and BCAF spheroids at 72 h (Figure 5B,E). Hence, the \u03b1-SMA protein levels decreased in a time-dependent manner during BCAF aggregation. Interestingly, a massive and significant reduction in the COX-2 protein levels was detected in BCAF spheroids at 72 h compared with BCAF monolayers (Figure 5B,C). This protein reduction was much more evident in BCAF spheroids at 216 h (Figure 5B,C). Hence, the dramatic decrease in the myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA and the pro-inflammatory protein COX-2 in BCAF spheroids collected at 216 h suggests that during cluster formation, BCAFs gradually acquire a deactivated and less inflammatory phenotype. As previously mentioned, while several studies claim that myofibroblasts are flexibly activated and deactivated in response to changes due to tissue alterations and wound healing, CAFs are still described as permanently active fibroblast-like cells unable to return to a quiescent state or tumor-suppressive state without pharmacological interventions. To the best of our knowledge, there are numerous agents targeting the biological functions of CAFs in vitro and some of them were assessed by clinical trials. Our study demonstrated that not only normal myofibroblasts but also CAFs have a more flexible phenotype by switching from an activated to a less active state without being drug targeted in response to changes in the surrounding environment and growth conditions. In particular, our analyses revealed that BCAF spheroids collected at 72 h exhibited a myofibroblastic and less inflammatory phenotype, whereas BCAF spheroids collected at 216 h displayed a much more deactivated state, characterized by a non-myofibroblastic and less inflammatory phenotype. The analysis of the mesenchymal marker vimentin, by western blotting, did not show any significant differences among the samples (Figure 5B,D). Hence, our data indicated that during the in vitro cell aggregation, BCAFs lost their constitutively activated phenotype by decreasing \u03b1-SMA protein expression in a time-dependent manner and reduced their pro-inflammatory phenotype by decreasing COX-2 protein expression.2.3. Reversion of BCAF Spheroids to Adhesion and Monolayer GrowthThe study of fibroblast activation/deactivation processes is of fundamental importance for understanding the role of BCAFs in BC growth and progression. In our previous works, we demonstrated that normal primary human myofibroblasts are not terminally differentiated cells and can return to a less activated state in vitro. We further demonstrated that these deactivated fibroblasts exert a stronger anti-tumor activity than normal myofibroblasts in vitro. Based on this experimental evidence, we evaluated the reversibility of the deactivated and less inflammatory phenotype acquired by BCAFs during 3D cell culture by analyzing the so-called reverted BCAFs, which were generated from BCAF spheroids collected after 216 h of 3D culture on agar. Precisely, we obtained the reverted BCAFs by transferring and culturing BCAF spheroids on conventional 2D cell culture dishes. The high stiffness and flat surface of the cell plastic dishes allowed for the spheroids\u2019 adhesion and the consequent outgrowth and spreading of BCAFs from the spheroids (Figure 6A,B).The reverted BCAFs were expanded and maintained as a 2D cell culture for about 20\u201330 days to allow the full outgrowth of BCAFs from spheroids (Figure 6C). As shown in Figure 6C, the reverted BCAFs displayed a large and irregular spindle-shaped or stellate-like morphology. To evaluate the state of activation and inflammation of reverted BCAFs, we performed a western blotting analysis of protein extracts from BCAF monolayers and reverted BCAFs. The protein expression level of \u03b1-SMA was diminished dramatically and significantly in reverted BCAFs compared to BCAF monolayers (Figure 6D,G). Reverted BCAFs also showed a decrease, although not significant, in COX-2 protein levels (Figure 6E,H). Our results indicate that during the transition from a 3D to 2D cell culture, reverted BCAFs partially retained the inactivated phenotype of spheroids. No significant differences were detected in the vimentin protein expression levels, confirming the mesenchymal phenotype of both BCAF monolayers and reverted BCAFs (Figure 6F,I).2.4. Evaluation of BC Cell Viability after Paracrine Interaction with BCAFs Grown as Monolayers, Spheroids or RevertedBCAFs have been shown to promote BC progression by sustaining, through paracrine interactions, the viability of tumor cells in the primary tumor mass and in the metastatic niche of a secondary tumor. In the primary and secondary tumor sites, BCAFs generate permissive and suitable microenvironments for cancer cell survival and proliferation through the activation of signaling pathways common to both physiological and pathological cellular functions. Furthermore, during the metastatic dissemination, BCAFs can be found as circulating BCAF aggregates in the bloodstream, probably en route between the primary tumor and sites of metastasis to influence cancer cell seeding and growth in a secondary tumor. Based on this evidence, our study has also aimed to investigate the paracrine influence of BCAF monolayers, BCAF spheroids and reverted BCAFs on BC cell viability. Therefore, we performed the MTT assay on MCF-7 BC cell line to monitor cell viability following 48 h of treatment with the conditioned media derived from BCAF monolayers, BCAF spheroids at 72 and 216 h and conditioned medium derived from reverted BCAFs (Figure 7).We used MCF-7 cells incubated with unconditioned cell culture medium (Figure 7) as the control. Our results revealed that BCAF monolayer-conditioned medium significantly increased MCF-7 cell viability compared with the control medium, thus confirming the crucial role of BCAFs in promoting BC growth. However, the survival advantage conferred by BCAF monolayers was lost during BCAF aggregation. In fact, a significant decrease in cell viability was detected in MCF-7 cells treated with the conditioned media derived from BCAF spheroids at both time points compared with the same cells exposed to BCAF monolayer-conditioned medium. Interestingly, the conditioned medium from BCAF spheroids collected at 216 h, which acquired a non-myofibroblastic and less inflammatory phenotype, significantly reduced MCF-7 cell viability with respect to the conditioned medium from BCAF spheroids collected at 72 h, which exhibited a myofibroblastic but less inflammatory phenotype as indicated by the high levels of the \u03b1-SMA protein and low levels of the COX-2 protein. No significant differences were observed between MCF-7 cells treated with the control unconditioned medium or the conditioned media derived from BCAF spheroids at 72 h and 216 h. Therefore, BCAF spheroids at both time points did not alter the viability of MCF-7 cells when compared with the cells under the standard cell culture conditions (control). Interestingly, the conditioned medium from reverted BCAFs, as well as the conditioned medium from BCAF monolayers, significantly increased BC cell viability compared with both the control and conditioned media from BCAF spheroids at 72 h and 216 h. Furthermore, the conditioned media of reverted BCAFs and BCAF monolayers affected MCF-7 cell viability to the same extent. Therefore, our results revealed that the reversion of BCAF spheroids to 2D cell growth allowed BCAFs to restore their initial capability to increase MCF-7 cell viability.2.5. Evaluation of BC Cell Migration after Paracrine Interaction with BCAF Monolayers and Reverted BCAFsIt is well known that BCAFs establish a fine-tuned relationship with cancer cells and sustain their migration through the release of many secreted factors. To evaluate the influence of BCAF monolayers and reverted BCAFs on BC cell migration, we performed Wound-Healing Assays on MCF-7 cells treated with conditioned media derived from BCAF monolayers and reverted BCAFs. A standard cell culture medium was used as the control (Figure 8).This analysis showed that BCAF monolayer-conditioned medium significantly increased MCF-7 cell migration compared with the control medium, thus confirming the pro-migratory role of BCAFs on cancer cells. On the other hand, unlike BCAF monolayer-conditioned medium, the conditioned medium from reverted BCAFs failed to promote BC cell migration. Indeed, no differences were detected between MCF-7 cells treated with reverted BCAF-conditioned medium and the control unconditioned medium. Of special note is the fact that the migratory capability of MCF-7 cells treated with reverted BCAF-conditioned medium was significantly decreased compared with that of MCF-7 cells treated with the BCAF monolayer-conditioned medium. In particular, 24 h after wounding, the quantitative analysis (Figure 8B) showed a percentage of open surface area in MCF-7 cells incubated with the control medium of about 52 %. Conversely, at the same time point, in MCF-7 cultures treated with the conditioned media of BCAF monolayers and reverted BCAFs, the percentage of open wound areas was about 33% and 51%, respectively.3. DiscussionThe study of the reversibility of the myofibroblast phenotype is particularly important for the treatment of diseases, such as solid tumors including BCs, which involve myofibroblasts that in vivo do not revert to a normal phenotype and thus remain constitutively activated. In our previous works, we demonstrated that the deactivation of normal human myofibroblasts, forced to grow as spheroids, is associated with an enhanced capability to impair cancer cell viability and migration in vitro. BCAFs preserve a constitutively myofibroblastic phenotype and play a fundamental role in tumor cell proliferation and migration in both primary and secondary tumors. Interestingly, although CAFs are described as constitutively activated cells, several works demonstrated that it is possible to normalize CAFs or inhibit their biological functions through the administration of specific CAF-targeting agents, antibodies targeting CAF-surface markers or existing compounds that also have a strong influence on CAF functions. Therefore, targeting CAFs has become an increasingly appealing approach for cancer therapies. Furthermore, the detection of BCAF aggregates in the peripheral blood of patients with metastatic BC leads one to hypothesize that BCAF aggregates could represent markers of BC metastasis and could influence the metastatic process.In this work, we have demonstrated that human primary BCAFs preserve a flexible phenotype by switching from an active to a less active state without being genetically manipulated or drug treated in vitro. In particular, we demonstrated that during spheroid formation, BCAFs undergo a step-by-step deactivation process and that BCAF monolayers and reverted BCAFs play different roles in the regulation of cancer cell migration. We showed that after 216 h of suspension growth as spheroids, BCAFs acquire an inactivated phenotype associated with a dramatic reduction in both \u03b1-SMA and COX-2 protein levels. The inactivation of BCAFs within spheroids was also supported by the MTT assay, which showed a significant decrease in the viability of MCF-7 cells incubated with the conditioned medium derived from BCAF spheroids, mainly from the spheroids at 216 h, compared with MCF-7 cells incubated with the BCAF monolayer-conditioned medium. These results strongly support BCAF deactivation as a potential approach to prevent BC progression through the reduction in BC cell viability. Furthermore, these data demonstrated that BCAFs are not cells in a permanent state of activation but they can change their phenotype and reacquire a less activated and less tumorigenic phenotype in response to changes of growth conditions. Therefore, the analysis of the BCAF spheroid-conditioned medium could lead to the identification of soluble factors or vesicles hindering BC cell viability. Furthermore, our data are in agreement with our previous works showing that the influence of fibroblast paracrine signals on cancer cell viability depends on the activation state of the fibroblasts. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that the conditioned medium from inactivated fibroblastic cells significantly reduces cancer cell viability compared with the conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts.It is noteworthy that reverted BCAFs displayed a different phenotype compared with BCAF monolayers, although the conditioned media of these two cell types equally influenced MCF-7 cell viability. In fact, reverted BCAFs showed a significant and dramatic decrease in \u03b1-SMA levels with respect to BCAF monolayers. Reverted BCAFs further exhibited a reduction, although non-significant, in COX-2 protein expression levels. This is the first time that BCAFs have been reprogrammed towards a less activated cell type, associated with a dramatic reduction of \u03b1-SMA without exogenous molecules or drug treatment. \u03b1-SMA is a marker linked to CAF activation and to a score of cancer progression.Based on different levels of \u03b1-SMA, two major subpopulations of CAFs have been identified in solid tumors: myofibroblastic CAFs characterized by high \u03b1-SMA expression levels and inflammatory CAFs with a high expression of tumor-promoting cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, it was reported that BCAFs with a high \u03b1-SMA expression are preferentially detected in more aggressive breast tumors, whereas less activated BCAFs showing a very low or no \u03b1-SMA expression are preferentially found in less aggressive BCs. In our experimental system, the significant decrease of \u03b1-SMA in reverted BCAFs is associated with the anti-migratory activity of their conditioned medium on MCF-7 cancer cells. These results indicate that reverted BCAFs are less activated fibroblasts compared with BCAF monolayers. Moreover, it is noteworthy that FAP and SPARC gene expression analysis in primary BCAFs and paraffin-embedded BC tissues showed that our in vitro tumor stromal microenvironment could be comparable to in vivo tumor stromal microenvironment.During the last years, important advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the influence of BCAFs on cancer cell migration associated with metastatic dissemination. Metastasis is the leading cause of BC-related deaths. Therefore, an improved comprehension of the processes regulating cancer cell migration could provide new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to both prolong survival and improve the quality life of patients with metastatic BC. BCAFs significantly sustain BC metastasis. In particular, BCAFs growing as adherent cells interact with cancer cells by paracrine interactions, remodel the TME and sustain migration and the metastatic capability of neoplastic cells. In our experimental system, further studies will be performed to identify the processes regulating the biochemical and functional rewiring of reverted BCAFs and to determine the differences between conditioned media derived from BCAF monolayers, BCAF spheroids and reverted BCAFs. These analyses could justify the cytostatic and anti-migratory effects of the conditioned media from BCAF spheroids and reverted BCAFs, respectively.This study highlights the molecular and functional plasticity of primary BCAFs in response to different cell culture conditions. Moreover, our results showed the reversibility of BCAF-activated phenotype without pharmacological treatment and thus led to the hypothesis that the in vitro generation of BCAF aggregates and reverted BCAFs could represent an in vitro strategy to induce BCAF inactivation. However, further studies are required to better understand the biological meaning and eventually identify the mechanisms leading to the functional and biochemical rewiring undergone by reverted BCAFs in vitro. Finally, in our experimental system, the characterization of factors regulating the interactions between stromal and cancer cells could be useful to study and develop new therapeutic strategies hindering the interplay between fibroblasts and cancer cells.4.

Isolation and Culture of Primary Breast FibroblastsNormal breast tissues were obtained from 3 patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty and BC specimens were obtained from patients with ER+/PR+ invasive BCs (n = 8, all females). Primary BNFs and BCAFs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, fresh normal and cancerous breast tissues were cut into smaller pieces (1\u20132 mm), and after repeated PBS washing, were plated and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with penicillin (100 mg/mL), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. The outgrowth of primary fibroblasts from surgical fragments was observed after about 1 week. The patient-derived fibroblasts sequentially outnumbered the cancer cells, which are known to be sensitive to sequential passaging. Indeed, epithelial cells are known to disappear after passage three. All the experiments were performed only with cells from an early passage (<10). For clinical information of all the utilized breast tumors, refer to Table 1.4.2. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy for Human Primary Breast Fibroblast CharacterizationA morphological analysis of the BNFs and BCAFs was performed as previously described. In particular, fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in donkey serum (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and diluted to 1:10 in 1\u00d7 PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The glass coverslips were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted to 1:50 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS and then subsequently incubated with an FITC donkey, anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK) diluted to 1:50 and phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted to 1:100 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA). Glass coverslip mounting was performed in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The immunofluorescence and fluorescence analyses of both the BNFs and BCAFs were carried out on an inverted and motorized microscope (Axio Observer Z.1) equipped with a 63\u00d7/1.4 Plan-Apochromat objective. The attached laser-scanning unit (LSM 700 4\u00d7 pigtailed laser 405-488-555-639; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) enabled confocal imaging. For excitation, 405, 488 and 555 nm lasers were used. Fluorescence emission was revealed by a main dichroic beam splitter and a variable secondary dichroic beam splitter. Triple staining fluorescence images were acquired separately using the ZEN Black 2012 software in the red, green and blue channels at a resolution of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, with the confocal pinhole set to one Airy unit and then saved in the TIFF format. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.4.3. Cell Viability and Wound-Healing Assays for Human Primary Breast Fibroblast CharacterizationTo evaluate the influence of the BNFs and BCAFs on MCF-7 cell viability in vitro, 1 \u00d7 104 MCF-7 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates and let to grow for 24\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the conditioned media from the BNFs and BCAFs. After 48 h of incubation, an ATP assay was performed by a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.A Wound-Healing Assay was performed to analyze and compare the influence of BNFs and BCAFs on MCF-7 cell migration in vitro. Briefly, 5 \u00d7 105 MCF-7 cells were cultured in each well of a 12-well plate and grown until 100% confluence. Then, the confluent monolayer of the cells was carefully scratched with a sterilized pipette tip, and, after wounding, the plates were rinsed with 1 \u00d7 PBS to remove cell debris. Cells were incubated with the conditioned media from the BNFs and BCAFs. Photographs of the same fields were taken at 0 and 48 h with a camera connected to a CKX41 model Olympus phase-contrast microscope and the images were acquired using the Cell-A software. A quantitative analysis of the open wound was performed by measuring the gap area at different time points using the Image J software, version 1.48i (the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The ratio between the relative open surface area at the indicated time points and at baseline was calculated.4.4. Real Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from the cell samples using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or in alternative Maxwell RSC simplyRNA Cells (Promega) and was processed with a Maxwell RSC Instrument (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A reverse transcription reaction was performed using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s directions. A quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in LightCycler 96 (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche) and each validated primer. The validated qRT-PCR primers were from Eurofins (Milan). GAPDH was used as an internal control. Total RNA from formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) tissues was isolated using the Maxwell RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and was processed with a Maxwell RSC Instrument (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as described in the study of Barbato et al.. The primer sequences are listed in Table 2.4.5. ImmunohistochemistryThe BCAF spheroids collected at 72 and 216 h were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Then, each spheroid was embedded in paraffin (Bio-Optica Milano SpA, Milan, Italy), sliced into serial 4\u00a0\u03bcm-thick sections and placed on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Menzel-Glaser, Brunswick, Germany). The slides were deparaffinized twice in xylene, rehydrated and immersed in 10 mM of citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 6, in a microwave oven (VWR) for three cycles of 5 min at 650 Watt to exclude epitope masking owing to fixation. The spheroids deparaffinized sections were hematoxylin and eosin stained (Bio-Optica) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. These sections, on glass slides, were converted into high-resolution digital data through NanoZoomer-2.0RS digital scanner (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan, Asia). Other sections were immunostained with primary antibodies against vimentin (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA), COX-2 and \u03b1-SMA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), detected by the ULTRA View UNIVERSAL DAB DETECTION KIT (Ventana Medical Systems), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.4.6. Generation and Growth of BCAF Spheroids and Cell CultureThe BCAF spheroids were generated using the hanging-drops and agarose-coated U-bottom well plates adapted methods, as previously described. The reverted BCAFs were obtained as previously described. Briefly, the BCAF spheroids collected after 216 h of 3D cell culture were transferred to cell culture plates, expanded and maintained in culture as 2D monolayers for about 20\u201330 days to allow the full outgrowth of the BCAFS from the spheroids. The BCAFs, grown as a monolayer or as spheroids, and the reverted BCAFs were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 20% FBS, 200\u00a0mM of l-glutamine, penicillin (100\u00a0mg/mL) and streptomycin (100\u00a0mg/mL) in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. All the experiments were performed only with cells from an early passage (<10).The MCF-7 BC cell line was kindly provided by CEINGE (Naples, Italy) and cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in DMEM, containing 10% FBS, 200\u00a0mM of l-glutamine, penicillin (100\u00a0mg/mL) and streptomycin (100\u00a0mg/mL).Cell treatments were carried out after 24 h from plating. The cells and spheroids were observed with a phase-contrast microscope Olympus (Tokyo, Japan, Asia) CKX41 model; the images were acquired with a camera connected to the microscope by means of Cell-A software. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.4.7. Total Cell Lysates and Western Blotting AnalysisThe BNFs, BCAFs and spheroids were collected, washed with PBS, lysed in an ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (50\u00a0mM of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150\u00a0mM of NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1\u00a0mM of Na3VO4 and 1\u00a0mM of NaF) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktails (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Mannheim, Germany) and incubated for 30\u00a0min on ice. The supernatant, obtained after centrifugation at 12,000\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min at +4\u00a0\u00b0C, provided the total protein extract. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford\u2019s method. For the western blot analysis, equal amounts of total protein extracts (20\u00a0\u03bcg) were loaded per lane on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Following electrophoresis and a transfer to the Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), the membrane was incubated in 5% non-fat milk in PBS-Tween. The filter was incubated with the specific primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight, COX-2, \u03b1-SMA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), vimentin (Cell Signal Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), GAPDH (Cell Signal Technology) and then with the horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then analyzed by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction, using a Super Signal West Pico kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions; the signals were visualized by autoradiography.4.8. MTT AssayThe MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells treated with the conditioned media derived from BCAF monolayers, BCAF spheroids and reverted BCAFs. A standard cell culture medium was used as the control unconditioned medium. Briefly, the MCF-7 cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and let to grow for 24\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium was removed and replaced with 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the conditioned media. After 48\u00a0h of incubation, 10\u00a0\u03bcL of 12\u00a0mM of MTT solution was added to each well, incubated for 3\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in the dark. Then, the conditioned media were aspirated and the MTT formazan crystals were dissolved in 100\u00a0\u03bcL of solubilization solution (0.01\u00a0M HCl in isopropanol). Cell number is correlated with the amount of formazan crystals formed. Absorbance at 570\u00a0nm was measured using a Multi-scan EX microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland).All chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.4.9. Analysis of BC Cell MigrationCell migration in the 2D culture condition was assessed using a Wound-Healing Assay. The MCF-7 cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) were cultured in 12-well plates and were grown until 100% confluence. The confluent cells were carefully scratched using a sterilized pipette tip and then washed with 1 X PBS to remove cell debris. MCF-7 cells were incubated with the control medium, the conditioned medium derived from BCAF monolayers or the conditioned medium from reverted BCAFs. Photographs of the same fields were taken at 0 h and 24 h. The images were acquired with a camera connected to a phase-contrast microscope Olympus CKX41 model, using Cell-A software. A quantitative analysis of the open wound was performed by measuring the gap area at different times using ImageJ Software (the National Institute of Health, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisNumerical data were reported in Kaleida Graph 4.0 and analyzed by a student\u2019s t-test; a one-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni corrections, was used for multiple comparisons.5. ConclusionsThe interactions between the TME and cancer cells dramatically influence the development and growth of solid tumors and the outcome of therapeutic strategies. Therefore, understanding if the TME is irreversibly differentiated into a pro-tumor phenotype or if some components of the TME can return to a less pro-tumorigenic or physiological phenotype is of great importance to both improve current anti-cancer therapies and to develop new therapeutic strategies.BCAFs represent the most abundant cell type among non-cancer stromal cells of the breast TME and show a constitutively activated phenotype sustaining cancer growth and progression. In this work, we demonstrated that it is possible to reprogram BCAFs toward a less activated cell type even without drug treatment in vitro and that BCAF inactivation is associated with a decrease in cancer cell viability and migration in vitro. In particular, we demonstrated that the conditioned media from BCAF spheroids and reverted BCAFs hinder the viability and migration of cancer cells, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that BCAFs have acquired an inactivated phenotype without the use of molecules or drug treatment. This work indicated that BCAF inactivation could be a useful tool to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting the interaction between TME and cancer cells. We strongly believe that an improved comprehension of how to appropriately target or modulate the activated phenotype of BCAFs and the interaction between BCAFs and BC cell will be critical to hinder BC progression and dissemination.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsA.A.

Conditioned media are profiled with the ELISA assay.IntroductionTumor microenvironments include fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells, and they are known to influence human breast cancer progression and malignancy. Cancers are not entirely autonomous and depend on nutrients and growth-promoting signals from supporting cells. Although cancer cells are highly plastic and can develop resistance to therapeutic drugs, supporting cells are generally more stable, with limited adaptation to external challenges. Hence, these stromal cells may provide alternative therapeutic targets with reduced toxicity. In a recent collaboration, we demonstrated that CD36 expression is downregulated in the fibroblasts of normal breast tissues with high mammographic density, suggesting that normalizing the microenvironment by correcting fibroblast CD36 expression may have therapeutic potential. In addition, tumor cells overexpress and secrete activin A, which can downregulate CD36 in fibroblasts, as modeled in Supplementary Fig. 1. Herein, we present a brief review of the literature associated with this hypothesis, followed by an experimental strategy for testing it.Activin A is a secreted macromolecule that is overexpressed in cancer cells or in response to microenvironmental stressors, such as increased mammographic density (MD) in normal mammary glands or organoid models of high MD. Activin A is a member of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily of cytokines, and similar to TGF\u03b2, it signals through pSmad 2/3 effectors to activate cell cycle checkpoints in normal cells. In addition, activin A induces tumorigenesis by increasing the production of cytokines that enhance tumor\u2013microenvironment interactions, thereby promoting anchorage-independent growth (AIG), migration of breast cancer cell lines, and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion.The secretion of activin A and other macromolecules by tumor cells, in turn, can transform fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that promote malignancy and tumor progression. CAFs play important roles in tumor fibrosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and collagen into the tumor stroma, and by mediating collagen cross-linking. Activin A was suggested to induce CAFs by down-regulating CD36, which is a membrane protein with roles in fatty acid and glucose metabolism. We hypothesize that normalizing the microenvironment by restoring CD36 expression may have a therapeutic impact. To test our hypothesis, we examined the responses of solid tumors to transfected fibroblasts using a series of quantitative assays. Because cell-cell interactions, such as those between tumor and fibroblast cells, are difficult to decipher, we investigated the basic components of this complex system independently and then combined them to perform additional experiments. Measurements of cell-based protein expressions were based on immunofluorescent microscopy because the analysis (a) is quantitative, (b) can be performed on a cell-by-cell basis, (c) requires a smaller number of cells, and our lab has extensive experience in quantitative analysis of on immunofluorescent images.Materials and MethodsCell subculture and maintenanceCells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. FM1 cells were cultured in fibroblast medium (Zenbio). MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. MCF7 cells were cultured in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and insulin.CD36 transfection and validationFibroblasts were transfected with CD36 overexpression and knockdown constructs using CRISPR-cas9 technology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC400233-ACT/KO) and validated using fluorescent microscopy per vendor\u2019s protocol. The transfection efficiency was around 75%. The vendor\u2019s protocol was followed without modifications. Negative control cells were transfected with empty plasmid vectors. After 24 h, transfected cells were stained with the CD36 antibody (Santa Cruz Technology SC73643). Immunofluorescence microscopy analyses of transfected cells indicated that the transfection was stable for up to four passages.Co-culture of fibroblasts and epithelial cellsFibroblasts (CD36+, CD36\u2212) were subcultured and grown in cell culture inserts (Thermo Fisher 1406274 and 141008) to 90% confluency. Layers of Matrigel (50\u03bcm thick) were then added to each well (24 well plate). In single sets of plates, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured using the on-top method. With both cell types, media was added, and disposable inserts containing fibroblasts were hung well above the epithelial cells to allow the exchange of macromolecules. The epithelial\u2013fibroblast ratio was maintained at 1:3. Co-culture media was a 50%/50% mixture of culture media for epithelial and fibroblast cells. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 co-cultures with fibroblasts were incubated for 10 and 7 days, respectively.Profiling of activin A secretionsMCF7, MDA-MB-231, and nontransformed MCF10A (for use in a control group) cells were grown in 3D culture using the \u201con-top\u201d method and were then co-cultured with fibroblasts (CD36+, CD36\u2212). On days 3 and 6, conditioned media was collected and analyzed using activin A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kits (Thermo Fisher, EHACTIVINA) per specified protocol.CD36 expression in primary fibroblasts under the influence of Activin AExpressions of CD36, in fibroblasts, were quantified in (i) monocultures of primary fibroblasts, and (ii) co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 with primary fibroblasts. In each case, controls included CD36+ and CD36\u2212 fibroblasts and activin A neutralizing antibody. The concentration of neutralizing antibody (R&D system, MAB3381) was set at 1 \u03bcg/mL. All experiments were performed in triplicates.In the first experiment, monocultures of fibroblast cells were exposed to concentrations of activin A at 1, 2.25, or 20ng/mL and prepared through serial dilution. In the second experiment, primary fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 were seeded in 24-well plates, and cell culture inserts with the seeding density of 4.5k and 1.5k cells per well, respectively. The MDA-MB-231 was cultured in the insert. 24 hours after seeding, the fibroblasts and tumor cells were co-cultured together without cell-cell contact. On days 3 and 5, fibroblasts were fixed and stained with CD36 antibody and DAPI nuclear stain. Experiments for each of the two days were performed in separate plates with independent controls.Fixation and immunofluorescence stainingCell cultures were fixed at room temperature in 10% formalin supplemented with 0.5% saponin (Sigma 47036) for 15 min. After three washes in calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized using a 0.1% Triton X-100 solution for 5 min, were washed again three times, and were treated for 1h with blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma A7638) and 1% goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 115005044). Samples were stained for differing molecular endpoints, but nuclei were stained with 50-ng/mL 4\u2019\u22126-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Science Technology D1306) to profile growth inhibition or colony organization in all samples. Monoclonal rabbit or mouse anti-human primary antibodies (CD36, Santa Cruz Biotech sc-7309; \u03b2-catenin, Abcam ab32572; \u03b24-integrin, Abcam ab133682; YY1, Abcam ab232573, pSmad2, Cell signaling, 18338, and pSmad3, Abcam ab52903) were diluted in blocking solution (1:500) and applied to cells for 1h. After three washes in PBS, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 and Alexa 565 (A11008 and A11011; Life Science Technology) were diluted in blocking solution (1:250) and were conjugated to primary antibodies for 1h. Cells were finally washed 3 times in PBS.Fluorescence microscopyStained samples were either imaged with (a) Olympus FV1000 confocal system with a 40X Olympus water objective with NA of 0.8 and WD of 3.3mm or (b) wide-field EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10 \u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) or the same objective used for confocal microscopy. In both cases, the excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 563 fluorophores, respectively. All imaging parameters were constant for conditions within the same experimentQuantification of molecular endpoints in the organoid modelWe have leveraged robust image analysis methods that were developed in our laboratory for quantifying fluorescent images. These methods involve accurate segmentation of each cell and aggregating readouts over many fields of view for each condition.For quantitative analysis nuclear-bound YY1 or Ki67, samples were imaged, in 3D, with a 40X objective with a confocal microscope. Subsequently, the middle slice was used for quantitative assessments. Regardless of the endpoints and for each condition, 60 colonies were randomly selected, imaged, and quantified. Quantitative analysis of YY1 and Ki67 were automated and performed on a cell-by-cell basis for each condition.For quantitative analysis of isolated cells vs. colony formation by MCF7 cells, DAPI stained samples were segmented. The average size of a single cell was established by measuring the size of 100 nuclei with a constant threshold in all conditions, and the numbers of isolated cells were counted automatically. Colony formations were imaged using phase-contrast microscopy and colonies were counted interactively. All channels associated with the antibody staining were background corrected against a well containing PBS and no cells.Anchorage-independent growth assays (AIG)The details of AIG are summarized in Supplementary file/Supplementary Fig. 2.Quantitative analysis of CD36 in fibroblastsTo quantify the CD36 expression in fibroblasts, samples were also DAPI stained and imaged with a 10X objective using a wide-field microscope. For all conditions, within a plate, eight to twelve fields of view were captured per well. Images were (i) background-corrected against 2\u20133 control-wells containing PBS and no cells, and (ii) binarized with the same threshold. The total fluorescent signal per field of view was averaged against the number of nuclei in the same field, where the number of nuclei per field of view was quantified using the method in the preceding section. All imaging parameters, within the same plate, were kept constant.Statistical analysisAll conditions were carried out in triplicates with a minimum of three independent experiments. The differences in the biological responses, between experimental variables, were significant if the p-value for the student\u2019s t-test was less than 0.05.ResultsActivin A downregulated CD36 expression in monocultures of fibroblast cellsControl fibroblasts were transfected with CD36\u2212 and CD36+ plasmid constructs for reference signals. In previous clinical studies, concentrations of activin A were reported to be approximately 1 ng/ml in stage IV lung adenocarcinomas and were 2.24 \u00b1 0.52 ng/ml in solid tumors. Activin A was also approximately doubled in breast carcinoma patients. Yet in laboratory settings, some researchers have used activin A concentrations as high as 80 and 320 ng/ml. These high concentrations may have been necessary to compensate for the sensitivity of available antibodies and the imaging mode of immunohistochemistry. In the present study, activin A was used at 1, 2.25, or 20 ng/ml, samples were fixed on day 5, imaged with immunofluorescent microscopy, and quantified using robust image analysis methods. The rationale for day 5 fixation is that in the co-culture assay with MDA-MB-231, the CD36 expression, in fibroblasts, was reduced on day 5 but not on day 3. The readout from the co-culture assay provides a more complex environment than the simpler monocultures of the primary fibroblast cells with day 5 being a timepoint for an observable downregulation of CD36. The result of CD36 expression in the monoculture and co-culture assays are shown in Fig. 1, respectively. The controls include CD36\u2212 and CD36+ fibroblasts and neutralizing activin A antibody added to the condition media. The readout for the CD36 expression for day 3 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.Production of activin A in 3D colonies of MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced in the presence of CD36+ fibroblastsWe quantified the concentration of activin A in the conditioned media of (i) monocultures of transfected fibroblasts, and (ii) the 3D co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 breast cancer cells with CD36+ and CD36\u2212 fibroblasts. Fig. 2a indicates that the secretion of activin A is increased in monocultures of CD36\u2212 fibroblasts. Fig 2b\u2013c indicates the concentration of activin A in the conditioned media of the co-culture assays on days 3 and 6. The results indicate that when normalized to the numbers of cells, activin A production was reduced when MDA-MB-231 was co-cultured CD36+ fibroblasts. Conversely, the production of activin A was increased when tumor cells are co-cultured with CD36\u2212 fibroblasts.3D co-culture of MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts showed growth inhibition or reversion of basal and lateral polarity, respectivelyMDA-MB-231 were cocultured with CD36+, CD36\u2212, or no fibroblasts, and fixed and stained after 6 days with DAPI and an antibody against Ki-67. Figs. 3a\u2013b show that the growth rates of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were significantly reduced and increased in co-cultures with CD36+ and CD36\u2212 fibroblasts, respectively. Moreover, Ki-67 expression, quantified on a cell-by-cell basis, was lower in tumor cells after co-culture with CD36+ fibroblasts. We also investigated changes in nuclear morphology under these conditions and quantified indices associated with the size and shape of nuclei for population analysis. Consensus clustering revealed the two significant populations shown in Fig. 3c and these were associated with high and low levels of Ki-67 expression. Specifically, the proportion of cells in the high Ki67 expressing cluster was larger after co-culture with CD36\u2212 fibroblasts (Fig. 3d). In addition, the frequency of enlarged nuclei increased following co-culture of MDA-MB-231 cells with CD36\u2212 fibroblasts. Larger nuclei are associated with higher grades of tumors, with the population analysis shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.MCF7 were cocultured with CD36+, CD36\u2212, or no fibroblasts, and fixed and on day 10. Samples were imaged with DAPI and \u03b2-catenin (lateral) and \u03b24-integrin (basal) antibodies and imaged using a fluorescence microscope. Remarkably, MCF7 cells formed basal and lateral polarized (BLP) colonies in the presence of CD36+ fibroblasts, as shown in Figs. 3e. We also evaluated colony formation in co-cultures of MCF7s with CD36\u2212 fibroblasts (Figs. 3f) or with no fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 5). Using the on-top method in 3D cell cultures, neighboring epithelial cells aggregate to form colonies. Organoid fusion and epithelial migration were previously performed to identify inhibitors that interfere with cell migration and colony morphogenesis. Hence, if the frequency of colony formation is reduced, then the rate of epithelial cell migration may also be reduced, as manifested by increased numbers of single cells. Fig. 3g shows that co-culturing with MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts decreased the frequency of colony formation and increased the number of single-cell present in the culture.Finally, after co-culture with CD36+ FB, MDA-MB-231 exhibited reduced anchorage-independent colony formation. Anchorage-independent growth (AIG) has been correlated with in vivo tumorigenicity. Finally, we co-cultured MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 breast cancer cells with CD36+ or CD36\u2212 fibroblasts under standard adherent culture conditions and then retrieved the cells on days 6 and 10, respectively. We then evaluated anchorage-independent colony-forming potential, shown to be correlated with in vivo tumorigenicity, per quantitative protocol summarized in the supplementary file. After 21 days of culture, samples were fixed, stained, and imaged (Supplementary Figure 6). Quantitative profiling of MDA-MB-231 colonies showed reduced anchorage-independent colony formation after co-culture with CD36+ fibroblasts compared with that after co-culture with CD36\u2212 fibroblasts Whereas MCF7 cells showed a similar trend, the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 3i).YY1 expression and pSmad2/3 were downregulated in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively, when co-cultured with CD36+ fibroblastsThe oncogene YY1 plays an important role in differentiation, proliferation, and tumorigenesis, whether tumorigenesis is induced by cell cycle regulation, inhibition of the p53 tumor suppressor, or apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of YY1 has been shown to alter the phenotype of MCF7 cells to one that resembles MCF10A cells, and conversely, overexpression of YY1 in MCF10A cells leads to a phenotype that resembles MCF7 cells. Hence, we investigated whether the reversion of polarity in MCF7 colonies co-cultured with CD36+ fibroblasts is related to YY1 expression. As shown in Fig. 4a\u2013b, YY1 expression was significantly downregulated in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CD36+ fibroblasts and was increased in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CD36\u2212 fibroblasts.The TGF-\u03b2 superfamily of ligands activates Smad proteins that regulate transcription and control cell proliferation in multiple cancer types. In particular, pSmad 2/3 are downstream effectors of activin A and TGF\u03b2 and play important roles in cell cycle arrest. Thus, we considered whether growth inhibition is consistent with the known mechanisms of tumor inhibition, such as downregulation of pSmad 2/3. MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in 3D with CD36+, CD36\u2212, and no fibroblasts for 6 days. Subsequently, samples were fixed and stained with DAPI and an antibody against pSmad 2/3. These experiments (Fig. 4c\u2013d) indicated that pSmad 2/3 are downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CD36+ fibroblasts.DiscussionWe hypothesized that the co-culture of CD36+ fibroblasts with breast cancer cell lines can suppress tumor formation and performed experiments using co-cultures of organoid models of two tumor cell lines along with CD36+, CD36\u2212, or no fibroblasts. We evaluated proliferation and colony organization in short-term experiments and the potential for colony formation in long-term experiments and quantified secretions of activin A in co-culture assays and in monocultures of CD36+ or CD36\u2212 fibroblasts. Subsequently, we investigated tumor growth in an immunocompromised mouse model. The present co-culture experiments show that the CD36+ fibroblast secretome either induces growth inhibition, in the case of the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells or reverses the aberrant polarity of 3D colonies of luminal-A MCF7 cells.Details of the mechanisms behind the observed growth inhibition and polarity reversion remain an open problem and the subject of our continued research, although the results suggested that these mechanisms differ between cell lines. These observations consistent with the mechanisms of tumor suppression involving the downregulation of pSmad2/3 and YY1, and with reduced secretion of activin A in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with CD36+ fibroblasts. Conversely, downregulation of CD36 in fibroblast cells resulted in a positive feedback loop that favored overexpression of activin A. Higher circulating activin A concentrations are associated with tumor progression. Tumor inhibition was also partially validated in immunocompromised mice, although larger animal experiments are required for statistical power. Collectively, however, the present data suggest that secreted macromolecules from CD36+ fibroblasts provide a program directive for tumor suppression. These macromolecules may include cytokines, microRNAs, DNAs, signaling peptides, and exosomes, and the ensuing molecular signals are likely to be diverse. We suggest that further studies are warranted to decipher the precise mechanisms behind the crosstalk and communication between these cell types.Future clinical strategies may include the targeting of activin A pathway, genetic engineering of fibroblasts to overexpress CD36 or identification of biomarkers in the secretome of CD36+. Targeting of the activin A pathway has been considered a strategy for treating breast cancer patients and the activin A inhibitor STM434 has received FDA approval, albeit with designation as an orphan drug. Recent studies also show that inhibition of activin A signaling enhances the therapeutic index of mainstay chemotherapy treatments in lung adenocarcinomas. However, because activin A also regulates muscle mass and modulates the function of immune cells, its clinical utility requires additional investigation. Genetically engineered fibroblasts have been examined for its anti-tumor effects have been shown in the liver metastases. But gene therapies must be restricted to overexpression of CD36 in fibroblast cells while avoiding tumor epithelial cells. This is a difficult goal because tumor cells often acquire molecular machinery from fibroblast cells. Finally, identifying biomarkers in the secretome of CD36+ or CD36\u2212 fibroblasts may provide a viable pathway for translation in extended studies.Supplementary MaterialThis is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01).

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "title": "Breast tumour cell-induced down-regulation of type I collagen mRNA in fibroblasts.",
        "content": "This study investigated the modulation of type I collagen gene expression in normal fibroblasts by breast tumour cells. Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from stages I, II and III breast tumour tissue revealed that collagen mRNA levels were elevated in stage I tumours compared to the adjacent normal breast tissues, whereas they were decreased in stages II and III breast tumours. This aberrant collagen gene expression was confirmed by non-radioactive RNA:RNA in situ hybridization analysis of 30 breast carcinomas which localized the production of type I collagen mRNA to the stromal fibroblasts within the vicinity of the tumour cells. In order to determine whether the tumour cells were directly responsible for this altered collagen production by the adjacent fibroblasts, breast tumour cell lines were co-cultured with normal fibroblasts for in vitro assessment of collagen and steady-state collagen RNA levels. Co-culture of tumour cells and normal fibroblasts in the same dish resulted in down-regulation of collagen mRNA and protein. Treatment of the fibroblasts with tumour-cell conditioned medium also resulted in decreased collagen protein levels but the mRNA levels, however, remained unaltered. These results suggested that the tumour cells either secrete a labile 'factor', or express a cell surface protein requiring direct contact with the fibroblasts, resulting in down-regulation of collagen gene expression. Modulation of the ECM is a common characteristic of invading tumour cells and usually involves increased production of collagenases by the tumour cells or stromal fibroblasts. This study showed that tumour cells were also able to modulate collagen mRNA production by stromal fibroblasts, which may facilitate tumour cell invasion and metastasis.",

        "full_text": "In vitro assessment of physiological traits and ROS detoxification pathways involved in tolerance of Damask rose genotypes under salt stressRosa damascena is one of the most important medicinal and ornamental plants in Iran which is tolerant of salinity to some extent. However, the selection of genotypes that are more tolerant to salinity will influence on Damask cultivation in salt stress-affected regions. For this purpose, a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replicates was performed under in vitro conditions on four Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl and Kashan) at 5 concentrations of NaCl (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mM), and the physico-chemical traits were measured 14 and 28 days after treatment.The results showed that Atashi genotype with high levels of Chl a, Chl b, total Chl content, carotenoids, relative leaf water content, proline, total soluble protein, TPC, TFC, TAA, and the highest increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as GPX, APX, CAT, SOD, and POD as well as the lowest amount of hydrogen peroxide showed a better protection mechanism against oxidative damage than the other three genotypes (Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl and Kashan) in the 14th and 28th days by maintaining the constructive and induced activities of antioxidant enzymes, it was shown that Bi-Khar genotype had moderate tolerance and Kashan and Chahar-Fasl genotypes had low tolerance to salinity stress. In vitro selection methods can be used effectively for salt tolerant screening of Damask rose genotypes, although the same experiment should be conducted in open filed cultures to verify the in vitro experimental results.IntroductionDamask rose (Rosa damascena) is known as an aromatic plant, and most researchers consider its origin to be Bulgaria, Iran, Turkey and India. Considering the various uses of Damask rose in medicinal products, perfumery and cosmetics, it has caused a lot of attention to develop its cultivation. According to the ability of Damask rose to be somewhat tolerant to environmental stresses it seems that the selection of a more resistant genotypes has a greater advantage for the development of its cultivation in the mentioned regions. Different degrees of resistance to salinity have been seen among rose and pistachio genotypes which depends on various factors, including cultivar, rootstock, irrigation and planting system. Therefore, it is of vital need to screen and choose the salt tolerance genotypes for sustainable agriculture.In recent years, drought stress is going to be widespread through the world and subsequently salinity is un-avoidable phenomenon as a secondary stress, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Iran is one of the countries where major abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity cause yield reduction, loss of soil fertility and impossibility of agriculture in most of its parts. Salinity is the major limiting factors in the soil which effect on plant performance and its chemical constituents. The harmful effects of salinity on plant growth are categorized in four items; (1) osmotic effect, (2) specific ion effects, (3) nutritional imbalance, and (4) production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Salinity caused to increase in the cellular antioxidant pool components such as carotenoids, ascorbate, proline, total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total antioxidant activity (TAA) especially in the tolerant variety of A. tricolor, while the sensitive variety accumulated the proline much more than other variety. Against negative effect of salinity on morphology and physiology of plant, increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and peroxidase (POD) activity under salinity have been reported also in plants. It is suggested that the increment of ascorbate and APX is the sign of tolerance in plants under stress. On the other hand, decrease in carbohydrates was expected because of prevention of the Rubisco and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase activities in plants under salinity. Attia et al. concluded that the salt resistance of R. damascena at 100\u00a0mM NaCl was correlated the maintenance of high water and chlorophyll contents, although lipid peroxidation was occurred by increasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents in Damask rose at 100\u00a0mM NaCl. It is also demonstrated that treatment of R. rubiginosa with 150\u2013200\u00a0mM NaCl resulted in higher extent of leaf chlorosis compared to lower concentrations (25\u201350\u00a0mM), and it is more tolerant to salinity- induced by NaCl than CaCl2. Our previous study showed that the tolerance threshold of Damask rose \u02bbKashan\u02bc to salinity was 50\u00a0mM (about 6.5 dS m\u22121), although the antioxidant capacity of explants exposed to 100\u00a0mM NaCl was higher than 50\u00a0mM. According to the our previous studies the Damask rose genotypes enriched with antioxidants were screened across to drought stress. Due to the high economic value of the Damask rose as a suitable medicinal plant in dry regions, it is necessary to evaluate some developmental and performance under salinity. In addition, one of the ways to select the genotypes with the best performance under abiotic stresses is to use of the tissue culture, which requires very little space and time. Considering that Iran as the main origin of Damask rose, it is located in the arid belt of the world and had the ancient history of growing the mentioned medicinal and valuable ornamental plant in saline areas, it shows that Damask rose can be an effective option for the development of cultivation in saline areas.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of salinity on some physiological and biochemical traits, under in vitro culture after 14th and 28th days salinity treatment to better elucidate non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidative defense pathways, regarding salt-tolerant by comparing four genotypes of R. damascena.ResultsPhysiological traitsThe effect of sampling time (14th and 28th day) and salinity on (a) RWC and (b) MSI of four Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan). Different letters indicate significant differences according to LSD test at P\u2009<\u20090.05.Salt stress in all Damask rose genotypes caused to a gradual reduction in leaf relative water content (RWC) and membrane stability index (MSI) in a concentration and time-dependent manner up to 100 mM NaCl (Fig.\u00a01a,b) RWC decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in four genotypes under the different salt concentrations (Fig.\u00a01a).

The least and the highest decrease in Chl a were related to the \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Chahar-Fasal\u2019 with a 170% and 340%, respectively (Fig.\u00a02a) compared to the control explants (Fig.\u00a02a). In the 14th and 28th days, the highest Chl a was observed in the \u2018Atashi\u2019 and the lowest amount in both times was obtained in the \u2018Chahar-Fasal\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 (Fig.\u00a02b). \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 had the lowest decrease up to 7% compared to the other genotypes on the 14th day (Fig.\u00a02b). On the other hand, \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 displayed the lowest Chl b on the 28th day, at sever salinity stress (100 mM NaCl) compared to the control. The highest amount of total Chl (1.441 mg g\u22121 FW) was related to the \u2018Atashi\u2019 in the control shoots while the lowest amount (0.179 mg g\u22121 FW) was related to the 100 mM NaCl and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u02bc (Fig.\u00a02c). In comparison with the control shoots, the \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had the least and maximum decrease by 170% and 460%, respectively. (Fig.\u00a02c). In the 14th and 28th days, the \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had the least total Chl (0.499 and 0.417 mg g\u22121 FW) and the \u2018Atashi\u2019 had the most total Chl (1.383 and 0.912 mg g\u22121 FW) (Fig.\u00a02d). According to the Table 1 \u2018Atashi\u2019 displayed the least decrease, with a reduction of 150% (Table 1) in Chl b compared to the control on 14th day. \u2018Atashi\u2019 had the most CARs content also on 14th day under control condition, while \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 at 100 mM NaCl on the 28th day, had the lowest CARs content. The greatest reduction in CARs were related to the \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 (411%) and \u2018Kashan\u2019 (586%) on the 14th and 28th days (Table 1).Antioxidant enzyme activitiesEffect of NaCl and

Furthermore, \u2018Bi-Khar\u02bc and \u2018Kashan\u02bc at 100\u00a0mM NaCl showed the maximum (626%) and the minimum (387%) increment in GPX on the 14th day, respectively compared to the control. At 75\u00a0mM NaCl, \u02bbAtashi\u02bc and \u02bbKashan\u02bc had the greatest (258%) and the lowest (119%) increment on the 28th day (Table 2). The activity of SOD in \u02bbAtashi\u02bc and \u02bbBi-Khar\u02bc showed the greatest and lowest amount (429% and 200%, respectively) in comparison with the control shoots on the 14th day, which were followed up to 204% and 160%, respectively on the 28th day (Table 2). Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in all genotypes was increased at 75 and 50\u00a0mM level of NaCl on the 14th and 28th days, although it was decreased at higher concentrations of NaCl (Table 2). The highest PPO activity was obtained in \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 50\u00a0mM NaCl on the 28th day, while the lowest activity was obtained in the control shoots on the 14th day. Finally, the highest increment was recorded in \u2018Atashi\u2019 (630%), and the lowest was recorded in \u2018Kashan\u2019 (390%) on the 28th day (Table 2). The activity of CAT and APX was increased in all Damask rose genotypes on 14th day and then reduced at higher concentrations of NaCl on 28th day. The most and the least CAT activity was detected in \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 75\u00a0mM NaCl on the 28th day and control treatment, respectively (Table 2). Our findings revealed that the highest increase was noted in \u2018Atashi\u2019 (420%) and the lowest was recorded in \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 (250%) on 14th day (Table 2). The most APX activity was observed in \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 75\u00a0mM NaCl on 28th day, while the least was observed in \u2018Kashan\u2019 under control conditions on 14th day. Our findings showed that the highest and the lowest increase in APX were obtained in \u02bbAtashi\u02bc (470%) and \u2018Kashan\u2019 (330%) on 28th day, respectively (Table 2).The effect of salt stress\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes on (a) POD activity, (b) sampling time (14th and 28th day)\u2009\u00d7\u2009four Damask genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) on POD activity, and (c) salt stress\u2009\u00d7\u2009sampling time on POD activity. Different letters indicate significant differences according to LSD test at P\u2009<\u20090.05.POD enzyme activity also increased along with increase in the level of NaCl, so that it showed the maximum and minimum value respectively in \u02bbAtashi\u02bc and \u02bbKashan\u02bc at 100\u00a0mM NaCl (Fig.\u00a03a). \u02bbAtashi\u02bc had the most POD activity on both times after treatment, while the least POD activity was related to \u02bbChahar-Fasl\u02bc. (Fig.\u00a03b).

Along with increase in the concentration of NaCl, the level of TPC also increased in all genotypes as the highest TPC was obtained in Atashi genotype under 100mM NaCl on 28th day (Table 3). The lowest TPC content was observed in the control explants of \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019, on 14th day. A marked enhancement of TPC content (324%) belonged to \u2018Atashi\u2019 under 100 mM NaCl on 14th day and the lowest was displayed in \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 (176%) on 28th day (Table 3). In the 14th day up to 100 mM NaCl and in the 28th day up to 75 mM salinity, all of the salt treated Damask rose genotypes showed a substantial increase in their TFC (Table 3). Also, \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 at 100 mM NaCl showed the greatest (270%) and the lowest (387%) increment in TFC on 14th day, respectively compared to the control shoots. On the other hand, under 75 mM NaCl, \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 had the greatest (258%) and the lowest (265%) increment in TFC on 28th day (Table 3).Total antioxidant activity (TAA) TAA was significantly affected by time, genotype and salt stress (Table 3). In all four genotypes, an enhancement in TAA was observed by increasing in NaCl concentration compared to the control. The highest TAA was obtained at 100 mM NaCl of the \u2018Atashi\u2019 on 28th day and the lowest was recorded for \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 and \u2018Kashan\u2019 control shoots on 14th day. The most significant increase in TAA was obtained in \u2018Atashi\u2019 (277%) under the highest concentration of NaCl on 14th day (Table 3).Protein, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen

On 14th and 28th days of the experiment, increasing in the NaCl concentration triggered a substantial increase in the amount of proline in all Damask rose genotypes. \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 had the maximum and minimum proline at 100 mM NaCl, compared to the control on 28th and 14th days, respectively (Table 4). As well as increase in the concentration of NaCl from 0 to 100 mM, the amount of H2O2 increased dramatically in all Damask rose genotypes. At 100 mM NaCl, \u2018Kashan\u2019 showed the maximum H2O2 with 236% and 264% compared to the control conditions on 14th and 28th days, respectively while \u2018Atashi\u2019 showed the minimum increase up to 212% compared to the control Damask explants (Table 4). All of the salt-treated Damask rose genotypes showed a significant increment in their MDA content on 14th and 28th days (Table 4) as \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 and \u2018Atashi\u2019 showed the most (380%) and the least (230%) increment at 100 mM NaCl compared to the normal condition (no salinity) on 28th and 14th days, respectively (Table 4).Multivariate analysis of Damask rose genotypes under NaCl treatment and sampling timeHeat map (a), loading biplot of the evaluated traits (b) and principal component analysis heat map (c) of the enzymatic antioxidants, the physiological and the biochemical changes in Damask rose genotypes. Genotypes under in vitro-induced salt stress condition. Heat map representing of relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI), Chlorophyll a (Chl a), Chlorophyll b (Chl b), Total chlorophyll (Total Chl), Carotenoids (CARs), Proline, Malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), Total soluble protein, Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), Catalase (CAT), Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), Total flavonoids content (TFC), Total phenol content (TPC) and Total antioxidant activity (TAA).Heat map analysis based on the response of Damask rose genotypes to salt stress simulated by NaCl applications under in vitro condition revealed that the traits including MDA, H2O2, proline, TAA, and TPC had positive correlation to salt stress tolerance. On the other hand, some traits such as enzymatic antioxidant including POD, SOD, CAT, APX, and PPO along with TFC, photosynthetic pigment, protein, RWC and MSI were also correlated positively (Fig.\u00a04a). Cluster analysis and dendrograms in the heat map (Fig.\u00a04b) revealed three major classes in the assessed traits of the plants under salt stress. Class I contained PPO, Proline, APX, TFC, SOD, GPX, TAA, POD CAT and TPC; class II contained H2O2 and MDA and class III contained MSI, RWC, CARs, Protein, Chl a, Chl b and Total Chl (Fig.\u00a04b). Moreover, biplot of variables confirmed the heat map cluster analysis in which traits classified in three groups (Fig.\u00a04a). In general, cluster analysis of heat maps for interaction between NaCl and sampling time indicated three classes. Class I contained the Damask rose genotypes was treated by NaCl and 14th day after treatment. Class II contained the Damask rose genotypes was treated by NaCl and 28th day. Finally, class III R. damascena genotypes under severe salt stress which was induced by 100\u00a0mM NaCl (Fig.\u00a04a).The principal component analysis (PCA) and the proportion of total variance (Fig.\u00a04c) explained that three PCA were contributing 87.5% of total variation. The first PCA was the most influential with the variance of 57.9% and contained the traits of CARs, TPD, PPO, Proline, SOD, CAT, APX, GPX and POD activity. The second PCA explained 24% of the total variance, and consisted of RWC, MSI, CARs, Protein Chl a, Chl b and total Chl. The third PCA explained 5.6% of the total variance with H2O2 and MDA (Fig.\u00a04c).Comparison of Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) under 100 mM salinity on the 14th day (a) and 28th day (b) after salinity treatment.Difference between Damask rose genotypes (Atashi, Bi-Khar, Chahar-Fasl, and Kashan) under 100 mM salinity on 14th day and 28th day after salinity treatment were illustrated in Fig.\u00a05a,b which is confirmed that Atashi genotype have had better performance than others 28\u00a0days after salinity treatment.DiscussionSignificant difference in Damask rose explants physiological traits such as leaf RWC and MSI was found among the four genotypes in this research (Fig.\u00a01). RWC is undoubtedly one of the first plant traits influenced by salinity stress, because water stress occurs frequently when plants are exposed to high concentrations of salt in soil solution. Our findings revealed that salt stress affected on the water state of Damask rose genotypes, resulting in a decrease in RWC in saline conditions (Fig.\u00a01a). Under control conditions, \u02bbAtashi\u02bc had the maximum leaf RWC (66.52%) (Fig.\u00a01a). RWC decrease has been documented in several melon species, which is consistent with our findings. Stevens et al. previously found that maintaining cell membrane integrity is important in salinity tolerance. MSI was reduced in this research when plants were exposed to salinity stress. Under saline conditions, \u2018Atashi\u2019 and \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 had the most stable cell membranes (Fig.\u00a01b). Several other researchers have confirmed these findings, which stated that salinity increased cellular electrolyte leakage, so that selecting genotypes with superior leaf MSI may result in improved salinity tolerance in plants.Salinity as well as drought stress, influenced on plant pigmentation as a decrease in the amount of photosynthetic pigments under salt stress is thought to be caused by delay in pigments biosynthesis or broken down quickly. Reduced Chl a and Chl b levels, as well as total Chl content at higher NaCl concentrations, were measured in all Damask rose genotypes shoot (Fig. 2a\u2013d). These findings are consistent with earlier research, which found that salt stress induced by NaCl, caused to decrease in total Chl concentration in Phaseolus vulgaris. Salinity substantially reduced Chl content and photosynthetic efficacy of peppermint. The enhanced activity of photosynthetic enzymes and the breakage of the pigment-protein complex could explain the decrease in Chl under salt stress. According to Khan, salt stress delayed the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. The total carotenoid content of all Damask rose genotypes grown in vitro culture supplemented with 100\u00a0mM NaCl was reduced (Table 1). The findings were consistent with those found in Cornus sericea and melons. Salt stress caused to \u03b2-carotene breakdown, which led to a lower carotenoid concentration. Carotenoids are thylakoid membrane components that absorb and transmit light to Chl, protecting it from photooxidation. As a result, the breakdown of carotenoids may also induce Chl degradation. The breakdown of photosynthetic pigments caused by salt is most likely due to higher toxic ions, increased chlorophyllase enzyme activity, and damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. According to the recent study, a high amount of toxic ions because of the various salts in effluent caused to the loss of photosynthetic pigments in wheat, including Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoids. Given that salinity changed photosynthetic pigment metabolism, it is evident that under abiotic stress, Chl content is tightly controlled.Salt stress can boost the actions of APX, CAT, and GR in P. popularis leaves. The antioxidant enzymes (GPX, SOD, CAT, APX, PPO, and POD) in this study responded differently to salt treatment, exposure duration, and NaCl concentration (Table 2). Our findings indicated that antioxidant enzymes such as GPX, SOD, CAT, APX, and PPO in the leaf stayed active after prolonged activation (14th and 28th days), (Table 2). The activities of SOD, CAT, GPX, and APX in Damask rose explants decreased as well as increased in salinity duration (28th day) at sever salt stress (100 mM NaCl). These findings were in line with those reported for Brassica juncea L. in which antioxidant system activities increased after brief intervals of 30 min to 5 days of NaCl treatment, and for maize seedlings treated for 21 days except for POD activity. Numerous studies have shown that when plants were treated with NaCl, the activities of APX, SOD, CAT, and GR increased compared to control plants. SOD and APX in mustard and maize, and GPX, SOD, and CAT in UCB-1. Under salinity, the transcript levels of the SOD, CAT, and APX genes stress significantly increased. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GPX activity increased in corn under salinity stress. When plants are subjected to salinity stress, ROS accumulation increased, resulting in an imbalance between ROS generation and scavenging, and cellular oxidative damage. Plants have been equipped with an effective scavenging ROS defense system that includes enzymatic (APX, SOD, CAT, GPX, POD) and non-enzymatic (carotenoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanin). Most likely, the levels of APX, GPX, CAT, APX, POD, and SOD in this research increased in order to reduce the amount of ROS generated under salinity stress. An increase in PPO activity is most likely an induced defensive response that delays senescence. The activity of PPO increased in response to salt stress with the highest activity in older leaves (Table 2). As an adaptive approach under stress, this could selectively promote cell death in these tissues, reducing further water loss and allowing limited nutrients to be partitioned to younger tissues. Previous research has shown that polyphenol production is influenced by abiotic variables such as ambient influences. According to Radi et al., salinity-induced changes in plant metabolism could result in an accumulation in various phenolic compounds.Under salt-induced stress, the total phenolic content increased in this research. Our findings revealed that as well as increase in NaCl level on the 14th and 28th days the total phenolic contents were also increased (Table 3). According to earlier study, increase in salt concentration significantly caused to increase in total phenolic contents level. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that salt stress can alter the phenolic molecules of plants, which are sensitive to salt. The synthesis pathway of total phenolic content may be linked to its buildup under salinity stress. The phenylpropanoid pathway is responsible for the production of phenolic compounds in plants, and this pathway can be triggered in saline conditions. Plants produced several hormones under salinity stress conditions, including methyl-jasmonic acid and jasmonic acid, which trigger phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity which is the primary enzyme in phenolic metabolism in plants results in the production of phenolic compounds. In this study, flavonoid content was tested at various salt levels, and along with increase in NaCl concentration, flavonoid content increased on the 14th and 28th days in all Damask rose genotypes (Table 3). Gengmao et al. demonstrated that as well as increase in NaCl concentrations up to 150 mM, flavonoid levels increased in safflower plant. It was also stated that under abiotic stresses, plants boost flavonoid synthesis to protect themselves from unfavorable stress circumstances. Plants use secondary metabolites in reaction to salinity stress to eliminate and cope to the harmful effects of salt stress. Plants use oxidative defense metabolism, compatible solutes, inorganic nutrients, hormonal control, and secondary compounds in reaction to salt stress. Flavonoids are essential secondary metabolites that decrease the negative effects of osmotic stress, such as salinity. Flavonoids accumulate in vacuoles, chloroplasts, and nuclei, and vacuole flavonoids interfere with hydrogen peroxide detoxification. Salt stress effects on plant water status by lowering the osmotic potential of the soil solution. As previously reported, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) system increased with increasing in salinity level. At moderate salinity, a small increase in antioxidant molecules and their activity implies a regulatory response. Significantly greater quantity and activity of these compounds, on the other hand, represent an apparent state of urgency to deal with oxidative stress under high salinity, which is also reflected in a significant growth decrease (Table 3).Lower protein loss in of \u2018Atashi\u2019 may be attributable to its increased tolerance to NaCl stress conditions. Furthermore, these findings showed that extending the time exposure of salinity, reduced the amount of proteins, particularly in \u2018Chahar-Fasl\u2019 (Table 4). Plants have a dual reactivity to protein patterns when exposed to salt. Salt stress decreases overall protein concentration while simultaneously initiating the synthesis of other specialized proteins required for salt tolerance via ABA activation. The increased activity of protease may be responsible for the breakdown of protein content in a saline soil. Degraded proteins may provide a storage form of nitrogen, which is important in osmotic regulation under stress.Proline content of in vitro cultivated Damask rose genotypes increased dramatically with increasing in salinity and time (Table 4). Our findings are consistent with previous studies of figure. Proline performs critical functions such as osmoregulation and lowering the negative effects of ROS during salinity stress. As a result, more proline accumulation in plants can result in greater saline tolerance. Under extreme salt stress, \u2018Atashi\u2019 had the greatest proline concentration in the current research (Table 4).Based on what we found, increase in the level of NaCl causes H2O2 levels to increase in all genotypes on days 14 and 28 after salinity treatment. Several studies have shown that when plants are under stress from salt, the amount of H2O2 in their tissues increases more. Under stress conditions, plants produce ROS, and an excessive buildup of ROS in response to salt stress can cause oxidative stress and severely damage natural metabolism via membrane lipid peroxidation. In this study, salinity increased the MDA level of treated genotypes significantly on 14th and 28th days (Table 4). Increased lipid peroxidation is a frequent sign of salt stress, which is caused by an increase in ROS production. It has been said that increased ROS formation may harm cellular organelles and components such as membrane lipids, whereas genotypes with lower MDA concentration are more resistant to salty conditions. In this aspect, \u2018Bi-Khar\u2019 has the lowest MDA content.ConclusionThe change in weather conditions due to global warming and increase in drought has led to an increase in soil salinity. Therefore, it is so important to measure the threshold of tolerance of different Damask roses to salt stress regarding to the way of defense mechanism. According to the results, it is clear that despite the severe stress applied to the Damask rose genotypes, the mechanisms involved in stress tolerance have worked well in these samples and the osmotic and antioxidant protection mechanisms against the death and deterioration of the explants. Although PPO was not activated under more concentrations of NaCl, POD and APX were the most common enzymes which kept their activation in 100\u00a0mM NaCl until 28th day after salinity treatment. Also TPC and TFC was in higher content until 28th day in tolerant Damask rose genotype, while other antioxidative enzymes as well as other osmolytes were up-regulated more at 14th day after salinity treatment. Based on the results we have selected the Atashi\u00a0>\u00a0Bi-Khar\u00a0>\u00a0Kashan\u00a0>\u00a0Chahar-Fasl genotypes as the most tolerant Damask rose under salt stress, respectively. So, it was concluded that Atashi genotype under 100\u00a0mM NaCl, was the most favorable and tolerant genotype with the highest optimal level of antioxidant activity and the accumulation of compatible osmolytes, as well as the high concentration of total soluble protein compared to the other genotypes. In conclusion, in vitro selection methods can be used effectively for salt tolerance screening of Damask rose genotypes, although the same experiment should be done in the field to verify the in vitro experimental results.Materials and methodsPlant materials and culture mediumOne-year branches with active growth of four genotypes of R. damascena including Chahar-fasal, Kashan, Atashi, and Bi-khar were taken from a research farm in Pakdasht, Iran. The plant material and shoots for wild collections were obtained under the supervision and permission of the Maragheh University guidelines and according to the national guidelines and all authors complied with all the local and national guidelines. Damask rose cuttings were washed 20\u00a0min under running tap-water, then they were surface-sterilized in 30% (v/v) NaClO for 20\u00a0min. The branches recut into the one node shoot explants (1.5\u20132\u00a0cm), and placed in the MS free hormone media, for the initial establishment which solidified with 7.5\u00a0g of agar. The pH value was adjusted to 5.7 before autoclaving at 121\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. Five Shoot nodes were cultured, in 150\u00a0mL culture vessels containing 25\u00a0mL of establishment medium as one replication, then kept at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0\u00b0C and 16\u00a0h-photoperiod (light intensity, 8.85 W/m2) and 60\u201370% RH. Following explants were screened every day for fungal or bacterial contamination then any contaminated vessels were removed from the experiment collection. Shoots were repeatedly sub-cultured three times at a constant three-week subculture interval.Proliferation medium and growth of cultureThe basic medium for proliferative media was the same as the MS establishment medium, plus 130\u00a0mg of iron sequester and 332\u00a0mg of CaCl2, as well as 0.36\u00a0mg L\u22121 benzyl adenine (BA) and 0.03\u00a0mg L\u22121 Indole 3-butyric acid (IBA). The pH was then adjusted to 5.7 and sterilized in an autoclave. After sterilization and transfer to the flow-box, 25\u00a0mL of medium was added to each culture vessels to be used for subculture. Finally, five explants were placed in 150\u00a0mL culture vessels containing the proliferation medium as one replication and transferred to the growth chamber to be propagated and then the mentioned propagated shoots have been used.Preparing the treatment medium including NaCl to induced salinityNaCl was added to the culture medium at five levels (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0mM) to simulate salt stress. Shoot explants with only four young leaves were placed in culture medium, and then five explants were placed in each culture vessel and transferred to the growth chamber and after 14 and 28\u00a0days, the explants were collected and evaluated for physiological, and biochemical traits.Physiological traitsRelative water content (RWC)Fresh leaf samples were weighted to determine fresh weight (FW), and then they were immersed in dH2O at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. After absorption of surface water, they were weighed again for turgid weight (TW). Leaf samples were then dried in the oven at 75 \u00b0C for 48 h and their DW was measured and RWC was calculated according to the Barrs and Weatherley protocol.Membrane stability index (MSI)Membrane stability of Damask rose explants were evaluated by 0.1\u00a0g of leaves. Then similar disks were detached of them. The samples were put in test tubes having 10\u00a0mL of dH2O in two sets. Then the electrical conductivity of the samples were recorded after incubation at 40\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min (C1) and 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min (C2) by means of EC meters (Jenway model, UK) and the protocol of Almeselmani et al..Chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll and carotenoids (CARs)About 0.5\u00a0g of finely mixed of leaves were extracted using 10\u00a0mL of 80% acetone. After 24\u00a0h incubation in dark place chlorophyll was extracted from completely blanched leaves. Then the amount of absorbance of extracted samples was recorded at 649, 665, and 470\u00a0nm by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550, Kyoto, Japan). For evaluating the concentration of chlorophyll, a standard method similar to Arnon, was applied.Biochemical traitsAntioxidative enzymesFresh leaves (1\u00a0g) were homogenized in 5\u00a0mL of 50\u00a0mM\u00a0K\u2013phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), brought to 5\u00a0mM Na\u2013ascorbate and 0.2\u00a0mM EDTA by the addition of concentrated stocks. The homogenate extract was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The supernatant was used for assessment of enzyme activities. Guaiacol Peroxidase (GPX) was evaluated by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 470\u00a0nm (\u03b5\u2009=\u200926.6\u00a0mM\u2009\u22121\u00a0cm\u2009\u22121) during polymerization of guaiacol. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1\u00a0\u00b5mol of tetraguaiacol per min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was assayed according to the protocol of Beauchamp and Fridovich, which is based on prevention of the photochemical reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium. The reactants were then placed under a 20-W fluorescent lamp for 15\u00a0min and the samples in the tubes were covered with a black cloth. At the end of the reaction, the absorbance at 560\u00a0nm was determined. The activity of catalase (CAT) was measured, as previously established by Li et al.. The Damask rose explant leaves (0.5\u00a0g) were grounded in liquid nitrogen and extracted with the following described method: 100\u00a0mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) including 0.1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) PVP and 0.1% (v/v) Triton\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. The extraction was centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected and applied for evaluating the enzyme activity. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity was done according to the Yoshimura et al. protocol. The reaction solution involved phosphate buffer (250 \u03bcL), 1\u00a0mM ascorbate (250 \u03bcL), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM EDTA (250 \u03bcL), 190 \u03bcL ddH2O, 10\u00a0mM trans oxide (10 \u03bcL) and 50 \u03bcL supernatant. The absorption at 290\u00a0nm for 1\u00a0min determined the enzyme activity. The activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was measured by Nicoli et al. protocol. The enzymatic solution was extracted the same as peroxidase. In this case, a reaction complex was prepared of 100 \u03bcL of enzymatic extraction, 2.5\u00a0mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 200\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.02-M pyrogallol as the enzyme precursor and was recorded at 420\u00a0nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).Total phenol content (TPC)Using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, the total phenolic concentration of Damask explants was determined as Singleton et al. method. The plant extract was combined with 0.5 cc of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, and the mixture was then held at 25 \u00b0C for 8 min. After 8 min, 2 mL of sodium carbonate solution (7.5% concentration) was added to this solution, and its volume was then increased with water to 8 mL. After two hours, the total phenolic concentration was determined using a 725 nm wavelength. A calibration curve was created using gallic acid as the reference. The amount of mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of sample was used to indicate the overall phenolic content.Total flavonoid content (TFC)Using quercetin as a reference standard, the total flavonoid was measured using the aluminum chloride technique. To accomplish this, 1 mL of quercetin extract or standard solution (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121) was added to a 10 mL volumetric flask containing 4 mL of purified water. After 5 min, 0.30 mL of 5% NaNO2 was added to the flask, followed by 0.3 ml of 10% AlCl3. After 5 min, 2 mL of 1 M NaOH was added, and the amount was increased to 10 mL with dH2O. The overall flavonoid concentration was determined at 510 nm. Total flavonoid amounts were recorded as mg quercetin equivalent (mg QE 100 g\u22121 FW).Total antioxidant activity (TAA)The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique was used to calculate TAA. 1 g of the fresh leaf samples was centrifuged at 21,913 g for 15 min after being separated with 2 mL of methanol at a concentration of 80%. After that, 100 \u00b5L of the extract was combined with 180 \u00b5L of DPPH (0.1 M), the mixture was left to sit in the dark for 30 min, and then a UV spectrophotometer was used to read the absorbance at 517 nm. The TAA was determined by applying the following equation:ProteinProtein content was assayed following the Bradford method, which was calibrated with the standard bovine serum albumin curve. So, 100\u00a0mg of the treated explants were placed in a test tube with 2\u00a0mL of 50\u00a0mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The solution was centrifuged at 7000\u201312,000\u00a0rpm. Then, the supernatant was taken and centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were prepared with 1:100 dilution ratios and read at 595\u00a0nm.ProlineProline content was evaluated by homogenizing 0.2\u00a0g of leaf fresh weight in 2\u00a0mL of 3% aqueous sulfosalicylic acid and then centrifuged at 10,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min. Then, the pellet was washed with 3% aqueous sulfosalicylic acid twice. The supernatant was pooled, and the amount of proline was evaluated using ninhydrin reagent and toluene extraction.Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)Explants H2O2 content was determined according to the Liu et al. protocol. So, 0.5\u00a0g of leaf tissue was grounded with potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 6.8), and then centrifuged at 7000\u00a0rpm for 25\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. A 100-\u00b5L aliquot of the supernatant was added to 1\u00a0mL of Xylenol solution. The solution was then completely mixed and left to rest for 30\u00a0min and the extract absorption was read by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at 560\u00a0nm.Malondialdehyde (MDA)MDA content was determined as 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive metabolites. So, 1.5 mL of the leaf extracts were homogenized in 2.5 mL of 5% TBA made in 5% Trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was warmed at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min and then cooled on ice quickly and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Then the absorbance of supernatant was read at 532 nm. MDA content was calculated as in the below equation:Statistical analysisThe factorial experiment was carried out based on a completely randomized design with 3 replications. Data were statistically analyzed by MSTAT-C ver 2.1 software and means were separated using the Fischer\u2019s protected least significant difference (LSD) test at p\u2009=\u20090.05.

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Only TIL PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with CAF PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CAF PD-L1 expression according to the SP-142 and E1L3N assays was also significantly associated with TIL PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u00a00.001 for both), similar to the 73\u201310 assay (Tables\u00a03, 4).

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation.

        "content": "To compare the localisation of mRNAs for the basement membrane degrading enzyme gelatinase A (72 kilodalton type IV collagenase) and its inhibitor TIMP-2 in carcinomas of the breast and basal cell carcinomas of the skin which have little or no ability to metastasize. In situ hybridisation was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded blocks using 35S-labelled riboprobes on 16 mammary carcinomas, three fibroadenomas, and a benign phyllodes tumour, and on 15 basal cell carcinomas of the skin (BCC). Labelling for both mRNAs was detectable in 14 of 16 mammary carcinomas and in 13 of 15 BCC, most often over organising desmoplastic fibroblasts in the stroma around invasive epithelial aggregates. Some sparse labelling was seen over malignant epithelial cells in six of the mammary carcinomas but not in the BCC. Some expression of gelatinase A mRNA was also seen in fibroblasts of breast lobules adjacent to the mammary carcinomas and around engulfed adnexal elements in the BCC, but not in unaffected breast tissues, fibroadenomas, the phyllodes tumour or unaffected skin. Maximal expression of gelatinase A and TIMP-2 mRNAs occurs in malignant neoplasms as part of the host response to the presence of established neoplastic cells rather than as an initial response to invasion. The degree to which this is present suggests this may be a highly relevant mechanism modulating tumour differentiation, growth and progression, possibly entailing uptake via specific receptors on the tumour cell surface.",

        "full_text": "Sirtuin 1, Visfatin and IL-27 Serum Levels of Type 1 Diabetic Females in Relation to Cardiovascular Parameters and Autoimmune Thyroid DiseaseThe loss of cardioprotection observed in premenopausal, diabetic women may result from the interplay between epigenetic, metabolic, and immunological factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of sirtuin 1, visfatin, and IL-27 in relation to cardiovascular parameters and Hashimoto\u2019s disease (HD) in young, asymptomatic women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Thyroid ultrasound, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurement, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were performed in 50 euthyroid females with T1DM (28 with HD and 22 without concomitant diseases) and 30 controls. The concentrations of serum sirtuin 1, visfatin and IL-27 were assessed using ELISA. The T1DM and HD group had higher cIMT (p = 0.018) and lower left ventricular global longitudinal strain (p = 0.025) compared to females with T1DM exclusively. In women with a double diagnosis, the sirtuin 1 and IL-27 concentrations were non-significantly higher than in other groups and significantly positively correlated with each other (r = 0.445, p = 0.018) and thyroid volume (r = 0.511, p = 0.005; r = 0.482, p = 0.009, respectively) and negatively correlated with relative wall thickness (r = \u20130.451, p = 0.016; r = \u20130.387, p = 0.041, respectively). These relationships were not observed in the control group nor for the visfatin concentration. These results suggest that sirtuin 1 and IL-27 contribute to the pathogenesis of early cardiac dysfunction in women with T1DM and HD.1. IntroductionThe accelerated atherosclerosis and early development of heart failure (HF) observed in diabetes patients have a multifactorial background and are still insufficiently understood. In recent years, increasing attention is being paid to sex differences in cardiovascular (CV) risk, which in combination with diabetes leads to a loss of cardioprotection observed in premenopausal women. However, the mechanisms by which sex may modulate the effect of diabetes on CV risk have not been exhaustively investigated.It has been shown in large meta-analyses that there is a significantly higher risk of coronary heart disease and HF associated with diabetes in women than men, especially in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). In fact, T1DM was associated with a 47% greater risk of HF in females than males as opposed to a 9% greater risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Additionally, a registry-based cohort study confirmed that the onset of T1DM before the age of 10 years results in a higher loss of life years by 3.5 years in women than men. Indeed, in light of the above studies, the latest guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) indicate the need for further investigation explaining the excess CV risk in females, especially with early-onset T1DM.According to current knowledge, the loss of cardioprotection in diabetic women may be due to genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, differences in anatomical structure and metabolism of adipose tissue, hormone-related oxidative stress, and the gut microbiome connected with inflammation and molecular factors involved in the formation of AGEs. Another possible explanation is that there is a link between CV diseases and autoimmunity, potentially through inflammatory pathways, especially in T1DM. Furthermore, it appears that the coexistence of a second autoimmune condition, of which Hashimoto\u2019s disease (HD) is the most common, may be associated with increased CV risk. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear.As shown in Figure 1, the suspected link between epigenetic, metabolic, and immunological pathways may be sirtuin 1, an NAD+\u2212dependent deacetylase that belongs to the enzymes of longevity.Sirtuin 1, the epigenetic enzyme that regulates various cellular pathways, has attracted significant attention over recent years because it is involved in the pathogenesis of both CV diseases and autoimmune disorders. A recent meta-analysis of preclinical studies demonstrated that resveratrol and metformin reduce hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, and exhibits a pro-inflammatory response by increasing the sirtuin 1-dependent intracellular antioxidant capacity. Thus, it appears that sirtuin 1, due to its antioxidant properties, may be important in alleviating diabetic complications. Moreover, the ability of sirtuin 1 to regulate interleukin 27 (IL-27) expression probably determines the maintenance of the immune balance and may be involved in the development of T1DM. IL-27 can exert both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, which is currently being considered in novel therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Another insufficiently explored molecule related to sirtuin 1 is visfatin. This adipokine exhibits nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) activity, and as an intracellular form (iNAMPT) maintains the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes, such as sirtuin 1, while the extracellular form (eNAMPT) can induce inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Recently, this adipokine was suggested to be a therapeutic target in cardiovascular-metabolic disorders. Despite the known interaction between visfatin and sirtuin 1 in the regulation of many processes responsible for cell metabolism and control of circadian rhythm, these relationships are still not well understood, especially in relation to T1DM.Given the often atypical or clinically silent progression of CV diseases in women with diabetes, identification of specific risk factors is a key step in early diagnosis and effective prevention. Thus, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential utility of sirtuin 1, visfatin, and IL-27 as markers of early development of atherosclerosis or HF in young, asymptomatic women with T1DM and HD. To the best of our knowledge, no research to date has assessed these serum levels in this context. The most relevant finding of our study is the demonstration of a positive correlation between sirtuin 1 and IL-27 levels and their significant association with thyroid and echocardiographic parameters in women with T1DM and HD.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study PopulationFifty patients with T1DM were enrolled at the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic of the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Poland. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of T1DM, HbA1c < 10%, age 18\u201337 years, female, and current euthyreosis status in laboratory tests. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or breastfeeding, had a positive history of CV diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, HF), were smokers, or had hepatic or renal disorders. Women taking any additional medication apart from insulin treatment and levothyroxine were also excluded. The participants were divided into two study groups: group 1 (n = 28) included women diagnosed with both T1DM and HD, while group 2 (n = 22) included women diagnosed with T1DM without other diseases. The diagnosis of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis was stated on the basis of the standard criteria: Elevated thyroid antibodies (aTPO and/or aTG) titer and typical ultrasound. Among the female patients with HD, 18 were treated chronically with levothyroxine, and 10 had elevated antibodies and a typical ultrasound image indicating thyroid autoimmunity but with normal TSH and fT4 without medication.Thirty age-matched, healthy women recruited from hospital employees and their relatives formed the control group (n = 30). The inclusion criteria were as follows: normal physical examination and no history of diabetes, CV diseases, autoimmune disorders, or other diseases. All the patients in the control group were without obvious features of thyroid autoimmunity during the ultrasound and had euthyreosis status in laboratory tests. Women taking any kind of medication, or who were pregnant or breastfeeding, were excluded.The study protocol was prepared in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Ethical Committee (Approval of the Ethics and Surveillance Committee for Research in Human and Animal Sciences at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; No. 22/2018 of 09 May 2018). Each patient provided informed written consent to participate in this study.2.2. Clinical Data CollectionMedical history and anthropometric measures were recorded during patient interviews. All the enrolled patients underwent a physical examination. The BMI (body mass index) was estimated as body weight divided by the squared height (kg/m2). Basic data were collected from each individual on a computerized datasheet.2.3. Echocardiography and ElectrocardiographyComplete 2-dimensional echocardiograms and Doppler scan studies were performed and analyzed by an expert echocardiographer following the recommendations of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging using an EPIQ system (version 7C, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands. The observer was blinded to the group under examination.The left ventricular dimension (LVD), interventricular septum (IVS), and posterior wall dimensions (PWD) in systole and diastole were measured using M-mode by the parasternal long-axis view. Atrial volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) were assessed using Simpson\u2019s method. The left atrial volume index (LAVI) was calculated by dividing the left atrium (LA) volume (measured from standard apical two- and four-chamber views at end-systole) by the body surface area of participants. The left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated using the Devereux formula indexed to body surface area (left ventricular mass index (LVMI)). The relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as double the PWD divided by the left ventricle diastolic diameter. E/A ratios were calculated using pulse-wave Doppler early (E) and late (A) diastolic mitral peak velocities together with the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and deceleration time (DT). Pulse-wave Tissue Doppler Imaging was used to measure peak diastolic velocities of the septal (E\u2019spt, A\u2019spt) and lateral (E\u2019lat, A\u2019lat) corner of mitral annulus in apical four-chamber view. Two-dimensional speckle tracking analyses was performed in the longitudinal three-chamber, two-chamber, and four-chamber views for left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS). A 12-lead standard electrocardiography ECG (10 mm = 1\u2009mV, 25 mm/s) was performed in a supine position during rest. The QT interval was corrected (QTc) for heart rate using the Bazett formula.2.4. Measurement of Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Thyroid AssessmentCarotid arteries were examined bilaterally using B-mode ultrasonography with a 10 MHz linear transducer and this procedure was performed by the same sonographer according to the guidelines of the Polish Ultrasonography Society. CIMT was measured three times on each side (right and left) and the mean value was calculated for each side and for all six measurements included in the analyses. All participants underwent thyroid ultrasonography according to the guidelines of the Polish Ultrasonography Society. The thyroid volume was calculated using a simplified formula for the volume of a spheroid: V = 0.5 \u00d7 W \u00d7 H \u00d7 L, where V is the volume of the lobe, 0.5 is the simplified coefficient, W is the width, H is the height, and L is the length. The volume of the thyroid gland considered in the study was the sum of the volumes of the right and left lobes.2.5. Biochemical AnalysisFor laboratory tests, venous blood was collected after overnight fasting and included measurements of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG) levels, and thyroid parameters. The range of normal values for fT4 was between 0.93 and 1.7 ng/dL, for fT3 it was between 2.0 and 4.4 pg/mL, and for TSH it was between 0.27 and 4.2 \u00b5IU/mL. The positive values for antibodies were >34 IU/mL for anti-TPO-Abs and >115 IU/mL for anti-TG-Abs. All of the collected blood samples were subjected to biochemical analyses immediately after collection on an ongoing basis in the hospital laboratory using standard methods. For all participants, sera were separated by centrifugation of the whole blood samples for 10 min and were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for further measurement of immune markers.2.6. Sirtuin 1, Visfatin, and IL-27 MeasurementsSerum concentrations of sirtuin 1, visfatin, and IL-27 were analyzed using commercial immunoenzymatic assays by an experienced laboratory technician in the Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology (Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland). The IL-27 serum concentration was assessed in duplicate by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Human IL-27 ELISA Kit, Covalab, Bron, France; sensitivity: 12.8 pg/mL; reference range: 0\u20131000 pg/mL). The optical density was assessed at 450 nm using a BIOTEK spectrophotometric reader (EPOCH model, Winooski, VT, USA.). The visfatin serum level was determined in duplicate using a commercial ELISA kit (Human PBEF/Visfatin ELISA Kit, Abclonal, Wuhan, China; sensitivity: 0.55 ng/mL; reference range: 0\u2013100 ng/mL). Optical density was assessed at 450 nm using spectrophotometric reader BIOTEK (model EL\u00d7800, Winooski, VT, USA). Finally, the serum concentration of sirtuin 1 was measured by competitive ELISA (Human SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) ELISA Kit, FineTest, Wuhan, China; sensitivity: 0.188 ng/mL; reference range: 0.313\u201320 ng/mL). Optical density was assessed at 450 nm using a BIOTEK spectrophotometric reader (model EL\u00d7800, Winooski, VT, USA). Measurements for sirtuin 1 serum concentration were performed in a single replicate based on dilution tests. All procedures were performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.2.7. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using Statistica 13. The Lilliefors and Shapiro\u2013Wilk tests were used to verify the normal distribution of data. A non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to compare two groups of unrelated variables. Differences between multiple groups were evaluated using a Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA test. To explore correlations among variables, a Spearman\u2019s correlation (r) test was used. Statistical significance was set at a p-value < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Study PopulationThe study population consisted of 80 females (mean age 26.4 \u00b1 4.4 years and range 18\u201337 years) including 30 controls and 50 participants with T1DM divided into two groups: T1DM and HD (T1DM + HD, n = 28) and T1DM without any other additional diseases (T1DM \u2013 HD, n = 22) (Table 1).There were no significant differences found in age, sex, body mass index (BMI), lipid parameters, TSH and fT4 levels, heart rate, or QTc interval among the sample groups. Importantly, women in all study groups had normal BMI and a favorable lipid profile. Notable, the rather low levels of LDL and TG, and fairly high levels of HDL present in the group with T1DM would generate a low atherogenicity index. Nevertheless, the group with T1DM had significantly thicker cIMT (p = 0.046) and lower EF (p = 0.001) compared to the control group. One explanation for these differences may be the association between historic glycemic exposure and its \u2018metabolic memory\u2019 and the long-term CV risk. It appears that non-enzymatic glycation of proteins and lipids leads to the activation of oxidative stress, causing long-term CV complications despite the attainment of glycemic control, which has been reported in T1DM. Indeed, the metabolic memory phenomenon results from the dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms that lead to changes in the expression of pathological genes responsible for chronic inflammation, which plays a key role in the development of atherosclerosis or cardiac dysfunction.The groups of patients with T1DM were similar in diabetes duration, HbA1c, daily insulin requirement, lipid parameters, and thyroid hormones. However, women with T1DM and HD exhibited significantly thicker cIMT (p = 0.018) and lower left ventricular GLS (p = 0.025) compared to women with T1DM only (Figure 2). These observed differences may be due to the relationship between autoimmunity and CV risk, as further explained in the discussion. Among the echocardiographic parameters considered, we found significantly lower LVMI (p = 0.01) and higher IVRT (p < 0.0001) in women with T1DM compared with the control group, and lower LAVI (p = 0.032) and higher RWT (p = 0.04) in women with T1DM and HD compared to women with T1DM only.3.2. Circulating Sirtuin 1, IL-27 and Visfatin LevelsAlthough there were no significant differences in the concentration of the markers tested between the sample groups, we highlight the differences that did exist. The levels of sirtuin 1 were non-significantly higher in patients with T1DM compared to controls (19.51 \u00b1 65.70 ng/mL vs. 17.51 \u00b1 38.39 ng/mL). Dividing T1DM patients into two groups according to the presence (T1DM + HD) or absence of HD (T1DM \u2212 HD), a higher sirtuin 1 concentration was found in the T1DM + HD group (32.68 \u00b1 86.06 ng/mL vs. 2.76 \u00b1 4.88 ng/mL. The sirtuin 1 concentration was lower in patients with T1DM alone compared with the control group. These results suggest a possible association of elevated sirtuin 1 concentration with patients that have T1DM and HD (Figure 3A).The levels of IL-27 were also non-significantly higher in women with T1DM compared to controls (22.06 pg/mL vs. 14.5 pg/mL). Similar to sirtuin 1, the levels of IL-27 were highest in the group with T1DM and HD (27.82 pg/mL) (Figure 3B). We found a significant positive correlation between sirtuin 1 and IL-27 levels in patients with T1DM (R = 0.329, p = 0.02) and with T1DM and HD (R = 0.445, p = 0.018). There was no significant association between sirtuin 1 and IL-27 levels in controls. In turn, the levels of visfatin were non-significantly lower in women with T1DM compared to controls (14.50 \u00b1 47.82 ng/mL vs. 22.06 \u00b1 60.38 ng/mL). In the T1DM + HD group, the visfatin concentration was even lower than in women with T1DM only (8.87 \u00b1 37.47 ng/mL vs. 21.66 \u00b1 58.61 ng/mL) (Figure 3C). We found no correlation in the serum levels of visfatin and sirtuin 1 or visfatin and IL-27 in any of the groups.3.3. Correlation Analysis between the Circulating Markers and Other Studied Variables Using Spearman\u2019s Correlation (r) (Supplementary Tables S1\u2013S3)We explored the correlation between sirtuin 1 (Table S1), IL-27 (Table S2), and visfatin (Table S3) levels with known CV risk factors (duration of diabetes, HbA1c, BMI, lipid parameters), thyroid parameters (TSH, fT4, fT3, anti-TPO, anti-TG, thyroid volume), and selected CV parameters (cIMT thickness, QTc interval, resting HR, echocardiographic parameters). All analyses were performed in four groups: group 1 + 2 included all women with T1DM (n = 50), group 1 comprised women with T1DM and HD (n = 28), group 2 comprised women with T1DM and no other conditions (n = 22), and group 3 contained healthy women as controls (n = 30).Spearman\u2019s correlation tests revealed that there were no significant correlations between sirtuin 1, visfatin, and IL-27 serum levels with duration of diabetes, total daily dose of insulin, and HbA1c levels. The visfatin level was positively associated with BMI, but only in the control group (R = 0.370, p = 0.044), and was negatively correlated with total cholesterol in group 1 (T1DM + HD) (R = \u22120.375, p = 0.049). With regard to the lipid parameters, there was a negative correlation between triglyceride levels and IL-27 (R = \u22120.437, p = 0.042) and sirtuin 1 levels (R = \u22120.489, p = 0.021) in women with T1DM only (group 2). IL-27 levels were negatively associated with LDL levels in women with T1DM only (R = \u22120.424, p = 0.05). These findings suggest a possible role of sirtuin 1, visfatin, and IL-27 in the lipid balance of women with T1DM.Considering thyroid parameters, women with T1DM and HD (group 1) exhibited a strong positive correlation between thyroid volume and both sirtuin 1 (R = 0.511, p = 0.005) and IL-27 levels (R = 0.482, p = 0.009). Similar, although less pronounced associations were found in all women with T1DM, in which IL-27 was positively correlated with aTG (r = 0.331, p = 0.019). In turn, visfatin levels were positively associated with aTPO in all women with T1DM (r = 0.321, p = 0.023) and were negatively correlated with fT4 levels in group 2 (T1DM \u2013 HD) (R = \u20130.591, p = 0.004). These results suggest that higher visfatin concentrations in the group of women with T1DM but without HD may be associated with reduced thyroid endocrine function and perhaps a greater predisposition to the development of autoimmune thyroid disease.The electrocardiographic parameters QTc interval and HR at rest were negatively correlated with sirtuin 1 in the T1DM \u2013 HD group (R = \u20130.435, p = 0.043 and R = \u20130.506, p = 0.016, respectively); in the control group, the QTc interval was significantly positively associated with sirtuin 1 (R = 0.510, p = 0.004). These differences may be due to the varied effects of sirtuin on the CV system depending on metabolic disturbances. Our results showed no significant correlation between either visfatin or IL-27 levels and QTc interval.cIMT was positively correlated with visfatin levels in the control group (R = 0.447, p = 0.013). There was no correlation between cIMT and study markers in women with T1DM. Our results suggest a possible association of visfatin with subclinical carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions, but this relationship does not appear to be specific to T1DM.Among the echocardiographic parameters studied, we found a significant negative correlation between RWT and PWD with sirtuin 1 (R = \u22120.451, p = 0.016; and R = \u22120.522, p = 0.004, respectively) in women with T1DM and HD (group 1). In patients with T1DM only (group 2), sirtuin 1 was correlated with wave E, E/A\u2019med, and A\u2019med (R = \u22120.440, p = 0.040; R = 0.426, p = 0.048; R = \u22120.478, p = 0.024, respectively). In the control group there was one significant correlation between sirtuin 1 and A\u2019med (R = 0.391, p = 0.033). Thus, sirtuin 1 levels appear to be correlated with echocardiographic parameters related to diastolic function, specifically in women with T1DM or a double diagnosis.IL-27 was correlated with RWT in patients with T1DM and HD (R = \u22120.389, p = 0.041), but this correlation was not observed in the other groups, which suggests an association of this cytokine with changes associated with myocardial hypertrophy in women with a double diagnosis. In contrast, visfatin levels were positively correlated with DT time (R = 0.424, p = 0019) in the control group, suggesting an association between this adipokine and early myocardial dysfunction, irrespective of the presence of T1DM.4. DiscussionIn this study, we focused on young asymptomatic women with T1DM, who were divided into groups according to the co-occurrence of HD. As recent reports indicate, this diabetic group is at high risk of developing CV complications. Although it is widely recognized that patients with autoimmune diseases are in a higher CV risk group, the molecular factors involved in this process are not well-known. A possible hypothesis is that this involves an interaction between epigenetic, metabolic, and immunological factors.Our results show that women with T1DM and HD, despite laboratory euthyroidism, have more unfavorable CV parameters (i.e., significantly thicker cIMT and lower left ventricular GLS) compared to women with T1DM without HD. Such findings suggest the involvement of an autoimmune component connected with autoimmune thyroid disease in the development of CV complications. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CV disease in women, we also assessed sirtuin 1, IL-27, and visfatin levels in the study population and we checked their correlation with selected CV parameters. Despite finding no significant differences in marker concentrations between groups, we found that women with a double autoimmune diagnosis had higher sirtuin 1 and IL-27 levels and lower visfatin serum levels than women with T1DM only, or women in the control group. Moreover, the sirtuin 1 was positively correlated with IL-27 levels in women with T1DM and HD, which suggests an association with thyroid autoimmunity. Indeed, it has been shown that sirtuin 1 interacts with transcription factor IRF-1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) at the molecular level, leading to the regulation of IL-27 expression, which is important in Th17 differentiation. In turn, Th17 lymphocytes have been shown to play an essential role in the induction of organ-specific autoimmune diseases including chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. Our data suggest a possible detrimental effect of IL-27, which is likely to contribute to the development of autoimmune thyroid disease in individuals with T1DM. In contrast, a recent study found reduced IL-27 serum levels in patients with Graves\u2019 disease, suggesting a possible anti-inflammatory role of these cytokines. A possible explanation for these differences is the effect of IL-27 on the Th1 to Th2 ratio, which is dominant in HD, whereas it is non-dominant in Graves\u2019 disease. IL-27 most likely enhances Th1 lymphocyte function and suppresses Th2, which would suggest an immune imbalance similar to that seen in T1DM or HD. In line with this assumption, studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms have confirmed an association between IL-27 and the SIRT1 gene with autoimmune thyroid diseases. In this study, aTG was positively correlated with the IL-27 serum levels in women with T1DM, but not significantly with sirtuin 1 serum levels. However, both markers were significantly associated with thyroid volume, which may be connected to the autoimmune connective tissue proliferation. Therefore, an evaluation of the local concentration of sirtuin 1 and IL-27 in thyroid tissue should be considered as a future research direction.Based on our findings, the marker most associated with echocardiographic parameters related to early cardiac dysfunction in women with T1DM is sirtuin 1. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation between sirtuin 1 with RWT and PWD was only found in women with T1DM and HD, which suggests an association between this marker with the left ventricular remodeling in this group of patients. Our results indicated that higher sirtuin 1 levels were correlated with reduced RWT, which on the one hand may be beneficial, but on the other can be associated with increased LVMI, which may suggest a higher risk of eccentric myocardial hypertrophy. As was suggested by previous studies, patients with T1DM are more likely than those with T2DM to have the dilated type of cardiomyopathy with systolic cardiac dysfunction, which is characterized by eccentric myocardial hypertrophy. Notably, such cardiac remodeling is probably related to autoimmunity. Moreover, the observed differences in the phenotype of HF depending on the type of diabetes have been explained by experimental studies in animal models, indicating different autophagy activity in cardiomyocytes, which was increased in subjects with T1DM and decreased in those with T2DM. Indeed, the greater predisposition to developing HF with a dilated phenotype observed in longstanding T1DM is associated with cardiomyocyte loss and progressive fibrosis, which may have an autoimmune basis. However, data on the assessment of sirtuin 1 and IL-27 in relation to CV parameters in autoimmune diseases are limited. The results of studies conducted in patients with T2DM were contradictory. Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence suggests that increasing the sirtuin 1 expression using antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin or SGLT2 inhibitors, may have a beneficial effect on the CV system. At the molecular level, it has been shown that this is associated with a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect by interacting with signaling pathways related to nuclear factor-kappa \u03b2 (NF-\u03baB), mitochondrial adapter p66Shc, and forehead box O (FoxO). Sirtuin 1 probably reverses vascular endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, which mediates the production of inflammatory cytokines and prothrombotic markers. Blood vessels can be protected from hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction by reducing the expression of p66Shc, which directly stimulates mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, accumulating evidence supports the proposal that sirtuin 1 increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase and upregulates FoxO, activating its antioxidant properties and delaying cellular aging. Furthermore, sirtuin 1 is believed to inhibit the release of proinflammatory adipokines from dysfunctional perivascular adipose tissue that mediates vascular calcification. Sirtuin 1 also exerts cardioprotective effects by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress against myocardial infarction injury. In conclusion, the protective properties of sirtuin 1 against oxidative stress reduce endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, remodeling of arterial walls, vascular aging, atherosclerosis, and heart damage. It has been suggested by experimental studies that the cardioprotective effect of sirtuin 1 depends on its concentration: A mild to moderate expression of sirtuin 1 exerted a beneficial effect, inhibiting aging of the heart, whereas a high level of sirtuin 1 increased oxidative stress and cardiac damage. Furthermore, one recently published study has shown that sirtuin 1 activity in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be a biomarker of different HF phenotypes, with increased levels associated with a loss of myocardial systolic function. Although in this study we measured serum sirtuin 1 levels in asymptomatic patients, our results gave similar observations. Indeed, higher serum sirtuin 1 levels were present in T1DM and HD patients who had lower left ventricular GLS, which is an early marker of cardiac systolic dysfunction. We found a significant positive correlation between IL-27 and RWT in women with T1DM and HD. This observation is in accordance with previous studies that showed an association between the IL-27 gene polymorphism involving SNP rs153109 with a predisposition to dilated cardiomyopathy and the deterioration of left ventricular function in the course of acute coronary syndrome. Our findings confirm the need for further research of the role of IL-27 in the pathogenesis of HF and have for the first time highlighted its association with sirtuin 1 levels.We found a significant negative correlation between sirtuin 1 levels and the QTc interval in women with T1DM and a positive correlation for the same parameters in women in the control group. Hence, it appears that sirtuin 1 may exert both beneficial and negative effects on the development of CV complications depending on its concentration, local expression, and individual variability. Kedenko et al. demonstrated associations between genetic variations at the SIRT1 with carotid atherosclerosis, with about 3\u20134 times higher effect sizes for women than men. However, we found no significant association between sirtuin 1 serum levels and cIMT in all groups of women. Similar results were obtained for IL-27, although its pathogenic role in the development of atherosclerotic disease has been indicated. We did find an association between lipid parameters and IL-27 and sirtuin 1 levels in women with T1DM, which may lead to an increased risk of atherosclerosis. It was demonstrated in an experimental study that atherogenic dyslipidemia enhances autoimmune responses in a Toll-like receptor 4 and IL-27-dependent manner. By contrast, in our study, women with T1DM had a favorable lipid profile, suggesting a low atherogenic index. Despite this, we found significantly higher cIMT and lower EF in the group of women with T1DM compared to the control group, and a significantly higher cIMT and lower left ventricular GLS in the group of women with T1DM and HD compared to women with T1DM exclusively. The hypothesis we propose to explain our results is that there is an association between autoimmunity and CV risk. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that inflammatory immune responses in patients with T1DM or HD are not restricted to the pancreas or thyroid gland, instead of causing systemic inflammation.. It is important to note that our study was conducted with women only, while the immune response that increases inflammation through various signaling pathways is likely to depend on sex differences. Sex steroids have been shown to be able to switch immune cells from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory actions and to regulate mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species. While in healthy women estrogens have the ability to reduce oxidative stress, in the presence of autoimmune disease this benefit diminishes, which could explain the increased CV risk in T1DM women. However, the exact mechanism governing these relationships is not known, and there is a need for further research into the molecular basis of CV disease progression in autoimmune disorders.Given the association of sirtuin 1 with visfatin at the cellular level and the recognition of this adipokine as a key mediator in the interaction between epigenetic and metabolic factors in CV complications, its serum levels were assessed in our study. Based on previous studies, visfatin has been identified as a potential biomarker of insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and CV disease. Moreover, recent reports have indicated its association with the development of inflammation in autoimmune inflammatory disorders. However, results concerning visfatin in T1DM and/or HD are limited and conflicting. In previous studies, circulating visfatin levels in T1DM were higher or lower compared to healthy controls. Recent studies have suggested a relationship between increased visfatin levels and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Our study showed non-significantly lower serum levels of visfatin in women with T1DM compared with women in the control group. The coexistence of two autoimmune diseases (T1DM and HD) was associated with even lower visfatin levels compared with women diagnosed exclusively with T1DM or healthy participants, but these differences were also non-significant. Our results correspond with those obtained in a recent study by Tompa et al., in which children with a combined diagnosis of two autoimmune diseases (T1DM and celiac disease) had lower visfatin levels compared with children diagnosed exclusively with T1DM. A possible mechanism underlying the negative correlation of visfatin with autoimmune dual diagnosis may be due to the function of visfatin in initiating de novo NAD biosynthesis, a deficiency of which is associated with a decreased amount of Treg. It is suspected that the altered function of natural Treg cells results from epigenetic modification and may be connected with susceptibility to common autoimmune diseases including autoimmune thyroid diseases. However, the significant negative correlation found in our study between visfatin and ft4 in women with T1DM only, and the positive correlation with aTPO in all women with T1DM, suggests an adverse effect of visfatin on the development of autoimmune thyroid disease, which needs to be verified through further study.With regard to the CV parameters, no significant correlation with visfatin serum levels was found in women with T1DM or with a diagnosis of T1DM and HD. The significant association between visfatin serum levels and cIMT in controls suggest that this adipokine may be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis, but without the link to autoimmunity. Visfatin probably affects the endothelial function and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the NF-\u03baB pathway in the early stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Notably, we also found a significant positive correlation between the deceleration time in controls, but not in T1DM women. This finding is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that an increased visfatin plasma level may be involved in the development of HF or adverse CV events. In fact, this adipokine, which is secreted by adipocytes and pro-inflammatory cells, probably exerts its effect on CV organs both through paracrine secretion in perivascular and pericardial adipose tissue, as well as through its release into the circulation. Therefore, visfatin should be considered as a biomarker for the development of early atherosclerosis.The main strength of our study is the inclusion of a homogeneous population of women, which allowed us to determine differences in CV parameters independent of poor metabolic control, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or thyroid hormonal imbalance. In addition, this is the first study to determine serum sirtuin 1, IL-27, and visfatin levels in women with T1DM and HD in relation to CV parameters. Notably, parts of the study were conducted by independent, blinded, experienced investigators from different centers, which allowed a more objective summary of the results. However, this study also has some limitations: (1) a small sample of patients was included in each group, which may affect the results of the study; (2) a lack of local expression assessment of the markers in thyroid tissue or myocardium means we could not provide a complete insight of the interaction between the molecules; (3) we did not assess CV parameters and studied markers in women with HD only. Moreover, to establish the female specificity of the markers it would be necessary to compare their concentrations in male and symptomatic patients with T1DM and CV diseases. Data regarding diet and physical activity, which may alter the hormonal profile and outcomes associated with CVD and T1DM, could have improved the study. Nevertheless, the limitations of our pilot study indicate new directions for further research, providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CV complications specific to women with T1DM, which, in light of the high CV risk of this group of patients, is essential to discovering a new therapeutic approach.5. ConclusionsIn this study, young asymptomatic women with T1DM and HD, despite laboratory euthyroidism, had significantly higher cIMT thickness and lower left ventricular GLS compared to women with T1DM only or without T1DM (control group). Although we found no significant differences in serum concentrations of sirtuin 1, IL-27, or visfatin between groups, our results indicate that cardiac dysfunction in T1DM and HD females may be associated with higher levels of sirtuin 1 and IL-27, which were positively correlated with each other and with echocardiographic parameters. Based on these findings, we propose that an interaction between sirtuin 1 and IL-27 may be considered a biomarker of early cardiac dysfunction in women with T1DM and HD. However, further research with a larger sample size will be needed to assess the potential relevance of these serum levels and their effect on CV complications in T1DM patients.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Table S1: Correlation between sirtuin 1 serum levels and selected cardiovascular and thyroid parameters, Table S2: Correlation between IL-27 serum levels and selected cardiovascular and thyroid parameters, Table S3: Correlation between visfatin serum levels and selected cardiovascular and thyroid parameters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, M.\u0141.-T., B.M.-R., E.F., L.C.; Methodology, M.\u0141.-T., J.Z.; Resources, B.M.-R., E.F., L.C., D.M.-G.; Supervision, B.M.-R., E.F., L.C., I.J.-M., D.M.-G.; Data curation, M.\u0141.-T.; Funding acquisition, M.\u0141.-T., B.M.-R.; Investigation, M.\u0141.-T., A.P., E.W.; Project Administration, M.\u0141.-T.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.\u0141.-T., B.M.-R.; Visualization, M.\u0141.-T.; Writing\u2014review and editing, M.\u0141.-T., B.M.-R., E.F., L.C., I.J.-M., D.M.-G., J.Z., A.P.

obesitySirtuin 1 is a possible link between metabolic and immunological pathways. The expression of sirtuin 1 depends on epigenetic factors and influences adipose tissue metabolism through various transcription factors to reduce lipogenesis and oxidative stress, and it also has anti-inflammatory effects and regulates the secretion of adipokines. Visfatin intracellularly (iNampt) catalyzes the reaction of the NAD+ synthesis pathway, which increases sirtuin 1 activity, while extracellularly (eNampt) it regulates responses to oxidative stress and inflammation.

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

Interface fibroblasts appear to be the primary myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.IntroductionA fundamental component of tumor invasion is stromal tissue remodeling, which involves proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and results in anoikis (a form of caspase-dependent apoptosis that is caused by loss of integrin binding of stromal cells). As a component of stroma, myofibroblasts are also exposed to anoikis during tissue remodeling. However, many studies have reported prolonged survival of myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling in patients with fibrotic diseases. Fibrosis is considered an indicator of tissue remodeling and is commonly formed around invasive types of tumors. Considering that myofibroblasts are key regulators of tissue remodeling and a major source of ECM production, which drives tumor progression, the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts may be an essential event during stromal tissue remodeling before tumor invasion.Abnormal and excessive ECM deposition not only is a phenotype of fibrosis but also is associated with cell-survival signaling mediated by integrin receptors during tumor invasion and tissue remodeling. Therefore, altered molecular expression in fibrosis may provide a clue to how myofibroblasts acquire an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling. Previously, we observed aberrant laminin-332 upregulation in the fibrosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) compared with autologous tumor burden and distal normal tissue, whereas such laminin-332 upregulation was not found in the noninvasive counterpart, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Contrary to our finding, laminin-332 expression was previously reported to be downregulated in breast cancer. Laminin-332, a large multidomain molecule involved in cell adhesion and matrix assembly, plays an important role in cell migration and survival by activating many signal mediators through binding to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24. The role of laminin-332 in cell survival or anoikis resistance has been studied mostly in epithelial tumor cells, although some data exist on laminin-332-dependent survival of keratinocytes during wound healing. One group demonstrated that the matricellular protein thrombospondin1 (TSP1) induces anoikis resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro . This work provided convincing evidence that an ECM protein can induce anoikis resistance in fibroblasts and suggested that laminin-332 may fulfill a similar function. However, because the fibroblasts used in previous studies were not derived from tumor stroma, the role of anoikis resistance of myofibroblasts in the context of tumor invasion remains undetermined.In this study, we hypothesized that invasive breast cancer cells induce laminin-332 upregulation in myofibroblasts undergoing tissue remodeling, which leads to anoikis resistance through laminin-332 autocrine signaling. To test our hypothesis, we used three types of fibroblasts isolated from IDC tissue and co-cultured them with breast cancer cells to investigate tumor-stroma crosstalk. Our results provide evidence that anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts develop during tissue remodeling of invasive breast cancer as a result of abnormal upregulation of ECM proteins and/or their receptors.Materials and methodsIsolation of primary fibroblastsHuman breast tumors and autologous normal breast tissues were obtained from three IDC patients undergoing surgery at Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Health System, Korea. The protocol for the study was approved by Severance Hospital Ethics Committee (4-2008-0380). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. Based on the zonal concept proposed in our previous study, primary fibroblasts were isolated from tissue in the tumor zone (TZ, tumor burden), interface zone (IF, fibrosis), and normal zone (distal normal tissue), as described previously.Direct and indirect co-cultureFor direct co-culture, primary fibroblasts were cultured with MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea), as described previously. MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were selected as representative invasive and noninvasive types of breast cancer, respectively. Adherent fibroblasts were stained with 5 \u03bcM Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes. The dye solution was then replaced with fresh prewarmed medium, and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 2 hours. After washing them twice with PBS, unstained cancer cells were plated onto a layer of CMFDA-stained fibroblasts. The co-cultures were incubated in reduced serum media (RSM) composed of DMEM/F12, 1% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin for 1 week. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts and unstained breast cancer cells were sorted with flow cytometry and used for subsequent experiments. For indirect co-culture, conditioned medium (CM) was prepared by culturing MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at 80% confluency in RSM for 1 day. The CM was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and diluted 1:1 with fresh RSM before addition to fibroblast cultures, which were incubated for a further 3 days.Transfection of fibroblasts with integrin \u03b24For transient transfection with integrin \u03b24, fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated on a six-well plate and transfected with 3 \u03bcg pRK6 b4 plasmid DNA (Addgene plasmid 16037; Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA; kindly donated by Dr. FG Giancotti, Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA), and 3 \u03bcl MATRA (Promokine, Heidelberg, Germany) in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl Opti-MEM on a Universal Magnet Plate (Promokine) for 15 minutes. Controls were transfected with 3 \u03bcg pRK5.Anoikis assaysFibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 1 ml) were added to either poly-HEMA- or serum-coated wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 with RSM, MCF-7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 6, 24, 48, or 72 hour. Maintenance of suspended fibroblasts in poly-HEMA-coated wells (anoikis conditions) was monitored by phase microscopy. Cell viability was measured by addition of 100 \u00b5l CCK-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours, fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (excitation, 530 nm/emission, 580 nm). Fibroblasts from three IDC patients were assayed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. For function-blocking assays, antibodies against integrin \u03b21, \u03b24, or laminin-332 (Millipore) were added to InF cells (which have high expression of laminin-332) with MDA-MB-231 CM and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours. CAF cells (which express low levels of laminin-332) were treated with purified laminin-332 (Abcam, Cambridge, England) in RSM for 24 hours.Caspase-3 activity assayCaspase-3 activity in fibroblast lysates was measured by using a caspase-3 activity kit (Becton-Dickinson-Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA). Fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells) were plated in poly-HEMA-coated-wells with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM and treated with blocking antibodies or purified laminin-332 for 24 hours. Fibroblast lysates were incubated in a 96-well plate in HEPES buffer with 5 \u00b5l caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in the dark. Fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (excitation, 360 nm/emission, 460 nm).Rac1 pull-down assaySuspended fibroblasts were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1\u00d7 lysis buffer. Rac/cdc42 assay reagent (10 \u00b5l; 10 \u00b5g) was added to 0.5 ml cell lysate, and the reaction mixture was incubated by rocking gently at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. Agarose beads were collected by pulsing for 5 seconds in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pelleted beads were washed 3 times with 0.5 ml Mg2+ Lysis/Wash Buffer (MLB), resuspended in 40 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Laemmli reducing sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then detected with immunoblot.ImmunoblottingSuspended cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed in 100 \u03bcl Protein Extraction Solution (Intron Biotech, Seongnan-si, Korea), homogenized with a 30-gauge needle, incubated for 30minutes at 4\u00b0C, and then purified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. After quantifying proteins in the extracts by using the Bradford method, 20 \u03bcg protein was electrophoresed on 10% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies against laminin \u03b32, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b16, integrin \u03b21, integrin \u03b24, Akt, phospho(Ser473)-Akt, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or Rac1 (Millipore). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).StatisticsStatistical significance (indicated by asterisks) was determined by using the t test and ANOVA. Results were considered to be significant at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows statistical software (SPSS Inc.).ResultsInvasive breast cancer cells induce upregulation of laminin-332 expression in stromal fibroblastsBased on the zonal concept that we previously introduced, stromal fibroblasts were isolated from each zone of IDC tissue after confirming expression of laminin-\u03b32, a subunit used to identify laminin-332. Primary fibroblasts from the tumor zone (TZ), interface zone (IZ), and normal zone were designated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), interface fibroblasts (InFs), and normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs), respectively. In morphology, InFs were slightly longer than CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A). After culture, InFs expressed a higher level of laminin-\u03b32 than did CAFs and NBFs, as they do in situ, and InFs and CAFs expressed a higher level of \u03b1-SMA did than NBFs (Figure 1B). To test whether factors secreted by invasive breast cancer cells can further increase fibroblast laminin-\u03b32 expression, we treated cultured fibroblasts with MDA-MB-231 CM. MDA-MB-231 CM dramatically increased laminin-\u03b32 expression in InFs compared with CAFs and NBFs. Thus, although MDA-MB-231 CM enhanced laminin-\u03b32 expression in all fibroblasts, the degree of increase depended on the intrinsic capacity of the cells to express laminin-\u03b32. In contrast, MCF7 CM suppressed laminin-\u03b32 expression (Figure 1C). Because the IZ is densely fibrotic, a hallmark of the tissue remodeling that leads to anoikis of stromal cells, the capacity of InFs to express laminin-332 under anoikis conditions was evaluated in the absence or presence of MDA-MB-231 CM stimulation. In InFs stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM, overexpression of laminin-\u03b32 was evident at 24 hours and was maintained for 72 hours (Figure 1D). Because transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is a major component of MDA-MB-231 CM, we speculated that it might be responsible for inducing laminin-332 overexpression. To test this, we treated InFs with 100 nM LY2157299, a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, and MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours and found that laminin-\u03b32 expression was suppressed in the LY2157299-treated InFs (see Additional file 1, Figure S1).Laminin-332 expression in stromal fibroblasts is upregulated by invasive breast cancer cells. (A) Isolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Based on the zonal concept introduced in our previous study, fibroblasts were isolated from early-stage IDC tissue (less than 10 mm diameter) by enzyme digestion after confirmation of laminin-\u03b32 expression. (B) Expression of laminin-\u03b32 and \u03b1-SMA in fibroblasts of IDC. (C) Stimulation of laminin-\u03b32 expression in fibroblasts by CM from cancer cells. Fibroblasts were incubated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours. (D) Duration of laminin-\u03b32 expression in interface fibroblasts (InFs) under anoikis conditions. InFs (5 \u00d7 105 cell/well) were seeded onto poly-HEMA coated six-well plates with RSM or MDA-MB-231 CM for 72 hours. Suspended cells were collected at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours, as indicated.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts is induced through direct contact with invasive breast cancer cellsTwo integrin receptors for laminin-332, integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24, are associated with signaling pathways for cell survival. A high level of integrins \u03b13 and \u03b16 expression was found in the fibroblasts derived from IDC (see Additional file 1 Figure S2). Integrin \u03b21 was also highly expressed in the fibroblasts, whereas integrin \u03b24 was not expressed (Figure 2A). It is widely known that the repertoire or pattern of integrin expression in stromal cells can be changed through communication with tumor cells. Because the IZ is adjacent to the TZ within tissue, CAFs and InFs can directly or indirectly communicate with tumor cells, and, as a result, the pattern of integrin expression in myofibroblasts may be altered. To test the effect of indirect communication with tumor cells, the fibroblasts were stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM or MCF7 CM. Integrin \u03b21 expression was not significantly affected, but remained high, independent of CM stimulation (see Additional file 1, Figure S3A). Integrin \u03b24 expression was also unchanged and remained undetectable (see Additional file 1, Figure S3B). For direct communication with tumor cells, fibroblasts were co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells. Integrin \u03b21 expression was not affected by direct contact with cancer cells, but was highly sustained (Figure 2B). In contrast, de novo expression of integrin \u03b24 was induced by direct contact with MDA-MB-231, but not MCF7, cells (Figure 2C). Neoexpression of integrin \u03b24 protein was also detected in fibroblasts after sorting from the co-culture.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression is induced in fibroblasts through direct contact with invasive breast cancer cells. (A) Endogenous expression of integrin \u03b21 and \u03b24 in fibroblasts of IDC. Fibroblasts were prestained with CMFDA and cultured in RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 72 hours before staining with PE-conjugated anti-integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 antibodies. (B) Integrin \u03b21 expression and (C) Integrin \u03b24 expression in fibroblasts cocultured with MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Confluent fibroblasts on 100-mm dishes were stained with 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 105) were added to the stained fibroblasts and cocultured for 1 week. Mixed cells were collected and stained with PE-conjugated anti-integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 antibodies. Integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 expression in cocultured fibroblasts was confirmed by immunoblot analysis after sorting.Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts is conferred by binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and by neoexpression of integrin \u03b24We found that MDA-MB-231 cells induced laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts, and that the fibroblasts expressed a high level of integrin \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 independent of their interaction with cancer cells (Figure 2, and see Additional file 1, Figure S2). Therefore, we hypothesized that the fibroblasts in IDC overcome anoikis through laminin-332-dependent survival pathways that are mediated by integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and/or \u03b16\u03b24. For the anoikis assay, laminin-332 upregulation in fibroblasts was induced by treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM, and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression was induced by transfection with an integrin \u03b24 plasmid. Integrin \u03b24 overexpression was confirmed in all transfected fibroblasts (see Additional file 1, Figure S4). Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts was examined by measuring their viability under anoikis conditions. In the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the viability of InFs (which express high levels of laminin-332) was increased by MDA-MB-231 CM but decreased by MCF7 CM, compared with the control incubated with reduced serum media (RSM) only. In the presence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the viability of InFs was dramatically increased at 6 hours and maintained at a level approximately twofold higher than that without integrin \u03b24 through 72 hours. In addition, the viability of these cells was further enhanced by treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 3A). Similar to that of InFs, the viability of CAFs (which express low levels of laminin-332) was increased by MDA-MB-231 CM and integrin \u03b24 induction, although the viability of CAFs was lower than that of InFs (Figure 3B). The viability of NBFs (expressing medium levels of laminin-322) showed a pattern similar to those of InFs and CAFs (Figure 3C). The viability of the three types of fibroblasts at 72 hours is directly compared in Figure 3D. Induction of integrin \u03b24 enhanced the viability of all fibroblast types approximately twofold compared with fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b24. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 CM only increased the viability of InFs, and to a lesser extent than did integrin \u03b24 induction.The anoikis resistance of fibroblasts is mediated by binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and/or integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Viability of wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing (A) InFs, (B) CAFs, and (C) NBFs in the absence or presence of stimulation from cancer cells under anoikis conditions. The figures show fibroblast viability in RSM (open square), MCF7 CM (open diamond), and MDA-MB-231 CM (open circle) in the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, and viability in RSM (black square), MCF7 CM (black diamond), and MDA-MB-231 CM (black circle) in the presence of integrin \u03b24 expression.

Black bar, CAFs; gray bar, InFs; white bar, NBFs; gray box, integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts. (E) Inhibition of the interaction between laminin-332 and integrin. InF and InF/\u03b24 cells were treated with isotype (black bar) and blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 (dark gray bar), \u03b24 (light gray bar), and laminin-332 (white bar) for 24 hours under anoikis conditions. (F) Increased viability of CAFs in response to treatment with laminin-332. CAF and CAF/\u03b24 cells were treated with purified laminin-332 (diluted to 10 \u03bcM with RSM) in poly-HEMA-treated 96-well plates for 24 hours. Black bar, untreated CAFs; white bar, laminin-322-treated CAFs. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.03 versus RSM in poly-HEMA-coated wells. Results are averages of three separate experiments.To confirm that fibroblast viability was associated with binding of laminin-332 to integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and/or \u03b16\u03b24, InFs and InFs/\u03b24 (expressing integrin \u03b24) were first stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM to induce laminin-332 upregulation and then treated with blocking antibodies against laminin-332, integrin \u03b21, or integrin \u03b24. The viability of both InF and InFs/\u03b24 was inhibited by blocking integrin \u03b21 and laminin-332, whereas blocking integrin \u03b24 had little effect (Figure 3E).To show that the viability of fibroblasts depends on laminin-332 expression, CAFs (Ln-332-low) were treated with 10 \u03bcM purified laminin-332, resulting in increased viability. The viability of CAFs/\u03b24 was strongly maintained, independent of laminin-332 treatment (Figure 3F).Laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppress caspase-3 activity in fibroblastsAnoikis is a form of caspase-dependent apoptosis that is caused by loss of integrin binding. Because caspase-3 is a key effector in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, we examined caspase-3 activity in fibroblasts in the absence or presence of cancer cell CM for 72 hours. Without integrin \u03b24 expression, InFs had lower caspase-3 activity than did CAFs and NBFs, and MDA-MB-231 CM further reduced caspase-3 activity, whereas MCF7 CM had no effect. In addition, the induction of integrin \u03b24 dramatically reduced caspase-3 activity, which also became much less dependent on MDA-MB-231 CM stimulation. The lowest measured caspase-3 activity was in InFs/\u03b24 cells stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 4A). To confirm whether the caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts is regulated by the binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24, InFs and InFs/\u03b24 cells were treated with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21, \u03b24, or laminin-332, and their caspase-3 activity was compared. Inhibition of integrin \u03b21 significantly inhibited caspase-3 activity in InFs and InFs/\u03b24, whereas inhibition of integrin \u03b24 and laminin-332 had no effect.Laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppressed caspase-3 activity in fibroblasts.

(B) Caspase-3 activity according to inhibition of integrin \u03b21 (dark-gray bar), \u03b24 (light-gray bar), or laminin-332 (white bar). The black bar shows the isotype control.

Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.03 versus RSM in poly-HEMA-coated wells. Results are averages of three separate experiments.Similar to these results, induction of integrin \u03b24 also reduced caspase-3 activity (Figure 4B). To show further that the caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts was decreased by laminin-332 upregulation, CAFs (Ln-332-low) and CAFs/\u03b24 were treated with 10 \u03bcM purified laminin-332, and the resulting caspase-3 activities were measured. Treatment with laminin-332 significantly decreased caspase-3 activity in both CAFs and CAFs/\u03b24 (Figure 4C).Enhancement of anoikis resistance by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression is mediated by Rac1 activationAkt phosphorylation and Rac1 activation are associated with integrin-mediated anoikis resistance. In the absence of stimulation from cancer cells, InFs showed a higher level of phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) than did CAFs and NBFs. Akt phosphorylation was enhanced by MDA-MB-231 CM and decreased by MCF7 CM (Figure 5A). GTP-bound Rac1 was downregulated in InFs but upregulated in CAFs and NBFs, and MCF7 CM further increased GTP-bound Rac1 in InFs (Figure 5A). Induction of integrin \u03b24 expression dramatically increased GTP-bound Rac1, independent of stimulation from cancer cells, but did not have a significant effect on Akt phosphorylation (Figure 5B).Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induces Rac1 activation. Akt phosphorylation and Rac1 activation is shown in (A) wild-type and (B) integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts. Wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts were incubated in RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM under anoikis conditions for 24 hours. Suspended fibroblasts were harvested for Rac1 pull-down assays.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses aggregation of fibroblasts under anoikis conditionsSynoikis, the formation of cell aggregates in nonadherent conditions, has been proposed as a mechanism by which cells overcome anoikis. Therefore, we investigated the role of synoikis in the anoikis resistance of fibroblasts and whether it is affected by laminin-332 upregulation or integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. In the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the fibroblasts aggregated and formed big clusters under anoikis conditions; this aggregation was not affected by the upregulation of laminin-332 by MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 6A). In contrast, integrin \u03b24 expression suppressed fibroblast aggregation independent of laminin-332 (Figure 6B). To confirm whether fibroblast aggregation is caused by integrin \u03b24 expression, rather than binding of laminin-332 to integrins, we treated fibroblasts with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24. Neither blocking antibody affected fibroblast aggregation (Figure 6C). Based on these findings, we suggest that integrin \u03b24 suppresses fibroblast aggregation in anoikis conditions. Synoikis is known to depend on E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; therefore, the suppressive effect of integrin \u03b24 expression on fibroblast aggregation may be caused by a decrease in E-cadherin expression. However, the fibroblasts expressing integrin \u03b24 did not show decreased E-cadherin expression compared with wild-type controls. Because \u03b2-catenin displays E-cadherin on the cell surface, we postulated that downregulation of \u03b2-catenin may be the cause of defective E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction. Consistent with this notion, \u03b2-catenin expression was decreased in fibroblasts expressing integrin \u03b24 (Figure 6D).Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions. Formation of fibroblast aggregates under anoikis conditions in (A) the absence or (B) the presence of integrin \u03b24. Fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105) were plated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM on poly-HEMA-coated six-well plates and incubated for 24 hours. The formation of cell aggregates was observed with phase microscopy. (C) The scattering of integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts under anoikis conditions was not affected by blocking the laminin-332/integrin interaction. Fibroblasts (2.5 \u00d7 104) were plated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM on poly-HEMA-coated 96-well plates with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 (diluted 1:100 with RSM) or MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours. (D) Decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin may cause reduced fibroblast aggregation. Suspended cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis of \u03b2-catenin expression.DiscussionIn the present work, we hypothesized that myofibroblasts gain an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling through laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induced by interaction with invasive breast cancer cells. To prove our hypothesis, we isolated three types of fibroblasts, CAFs from the tumor zone (the epicenter of tumor burden), InFs from the interface zone (fibrosis), and NBFs from the normal zone (distal normal tissue) of IDC, and co-cultured them with tumor cells to investigate the tumor-stroma interaction. InFs, the myofibroblasts undergoing tissue remodeling, showed a higher resistance to anoikis than did CAFs and NBFs as a result of their high endogenous expression level of laminin-332 and its dramatic upregulation by conditioned medium from invasive MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. In addition, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression was induced in fibroblasts by cell-to-cell contact with MDA-MB-231 cells regardless of the type of fibroblast, and expression of integrin \u03b24 increased anoikis resistance to a level approximately twofold higher than that induced by laminin-332 upregulation. From these results, we conclude that invasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression, and that InFs may be the primary myofibroblasts involved in tissue remodeling during invasion of breast cancer cells.This may be the first study to describe how myofibroblasts acquire an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling by using a model of invasive breast cancer. Previously, one group reported that transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) confers an anoikis-resistant phenotype on normal primary human fetal lung fibroblasts, and another group showed that the matricellular protein TSP1 induces anoikis resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, the fibroblasts used in these studies were not derived from tumor stroma, and we believed that it was necessary to investigate the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts in the context of tumor progression. Therefore, in this study, we used IDC to examine the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling.We chose to study IDC for two reasons: the first was the dense fibrosis around the tumor burden, which is a phenotype of vigorous tissue remodeling, and the second was aberrant upregulation of laminin-332 in the fibrosis (in contrast, laminin-332 upregulation was not detected in its counterpart, DCIS). Because laminin-332 is widely known to promote cell survival, the anoikis resistance of myofibroblasts is likely mediated by laminin-332-dependent signaling. To test this assumption, we first investigated laminin-322 expression in CAFs, InFs, and NBFs and found that the expression pattern in the fibroblasts was the same as that in situ (Figure 1A). Based on \u03b1-SMA expression and their location in the tissue, CAFs and InFs are presumed to be the myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.Within the interface zone (IZ) adjacent to the tumor zone (TZ), invasive breast cancer cells may interact with InFs via cell-to-cell contact at the border between the TZ and IZ or with diffusible factors away from the border and within the IZ. It is therefore possible that the expression of laminin-332 or its receptors, integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24, is affected differently according to the type of interaction. To test this notion, fibroblasts were co-cultured with tumor cells to simulate cell-to-cell contact or were stimulated with the CM from tumor cells to test the role of diffusible factors. In our previous study, laminin-332 upregulation in the IZ was shown to be associated with tumor invasiveness. Thus, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were used as invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cell types, respectively. After treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM, but not MCF7 CM, laminin-\u03b32, a subunit used to identify laminin-332, was upregulated in InFs, and this upregulation was maintained under anoikis conditions. Expression of laminin-\u03b32 in CAFs and NBFs was also promoted by MDA-MB-231 CM, but to a lesser extent than in InFs (Figure 1C). The degree of laminin-\u03b32 induction by diffusible factors produced by MDA-MB-231 seemed to depend on the endogenous capacity of fibroblasts to express laminin-\u03b32. According to previous reports, TGF-\u03b2 is a major soluble factor produced by MDA-MB-231. Therefore, we examined whether laminin-\u03b32 upregulation by MDA-MB-231 CM is induced by TGF-\u03b2 and found that the TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor LY2157299 effectively suppressed laminin-\u03b32 expression (see Additional file 1, Figure S1). Based on this result, we suggest that expression of laminin-322 is at least partially induced by TGF-\u03b2 secreted by invasive breast cancer cells. However, further evaluation is required because we did not test other cytokines that are highly secreted from invasive breast cancer cells. In contrast to laminin-332 upregulation by MDA-MB-231 CM, integrins \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 were highly expressed in fibroblasts and not affected by either diffusible factors or direct contact with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2, and see Additional file 1, Figure S3). Integrin \u03b24 was not endogenously expressed in fibroblasts, but its expression was newly induced by direct contact with MDA-MB-231 cells. Almost no difference was found in the induction of anoikis resistance by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in the different types of fibroblasts.When in direct contact with invasive breast cancer cells, the anoikis resistance of InFs involved both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 as a result of integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Although both integrins are known receptors for laminin-332, their signaling pathways, signal duration, and dependency on laminin-332 are different. In the case of integrin \u03b13\u03b21, signaling was dependent on laminin-332 binding and mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation (Figure 5A). In contrast, integrin \u03b16\u03b24-mediated signaling was independent of laminin-332 and mediated through Rac1 activation (Figure 5B). Anoikis resistance induced by integrin \u03b16\u03b24 was approximately twofold higher than that induced by integrin \u03b13\u03b21 (Figure 3D). This is supported by a report that Rac1 activation through integrin \u03b16\u03b24 produces a long-lasting survival signal. Furthermore, the long cytoplasmic tail of integrin \u03b24 can be phosphorylated by other factors such as c-Met, independent of laminin-332. In addition to anoikis resistance, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppressed fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions, possibly as a result of downregulation of \u03b2-catenin (Figure 6D). Many cells overcome anoikis through synoikis, the formation of cell clusters via E-cadherin-mediated interaction between cells. The expression of E-cadherin on the cell surface is known to be regulated by \u03b2-catenin; therefore, decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression may cause defective surface expression of E-cadherin, which in turn suppresses fibroblast aggregation. Considering a recent report that myofibroblasts in the primary tumor site metastasize to the lung along with tumor cells, in the context of tumor metastasis, single cells or a small aggregate of myofibroblasts may be more likely to undergo distant migration with invasive tumor cells than might a large cluster.In summary, two mechanisms seem to exist by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance through laminin-integrin signaling during tissue remodeling as a result of either direct or indirect interaction between invasive breast cancer cells and myofibroblasts in the fibrosis (or interface zone) (Figure 7). For indirect interaction, factor(s) secreted from invasive tumor cells stimulate myofibroblasts to overexpress laminin-332. Laminin-332 binds to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on myofibroblasts and turns on an autocrine cell survival signal mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. In addition, myofibroblasts that lose their attachment spontaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis.Two possible mechanisms by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance via integrin receptors for laminin-332 during tissue remodeling. Direct and indirect interactions may occur between invasive tumor cells and myofibroblasts in the interface zone of invasive ductal carcinoma. Myofibroblasts within the interface zone could be stimulated to express laminin-332 by diffusible factors from invasive breast cancer cells. Binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on the myofibroblasts turns on a cell-survival signaling pathway mediated by Akt phosphorylation. In this case, myofibroblasts may simultaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis. In addition, in the border between the tumor zone and the interface zone, invasive breast cancer cells can directly interact with myofibroblasts, leading to integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Once integrin \u03b24 is induced, myofibroblasts use both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 as receptors for laminin-332, and become resistant to anoikis via Akt phosphorylation (laminin-332 dependent) and Rac1 activation (laminin-332 independent). Moreover, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression may inhibit myofibroblast aggregation through downregulation of \u03b2-catenin.Second, direct contact between invasive breast cancer cells and myofibroblasts induces integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in the fibroblasts. Consequently, myofibroblasts express both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 as receptors for laminin-332. In this case, cell-survival signals are mediated by Rac1 activation and Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation requires binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21, whereas Rac1 activation by integrin \u03b16\u03b24 is not dependent on laminin-332. Furthermore, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions, possibly through downregulation of \u03b2-catenin.ConclusionsInvasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Our findings indicate that interface fibroblasts may be the primary myofibroblasts involved in tissue remodeling during breast cancer invasion.AbbreviationsCAF: cancer-associated fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the TZ); CMFDA: (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate); DCIS: ductal carcinoma in situ; ECM: extracellular matrix; IDC: invasive ductal carcinoma; InF: interface fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the IZ); IZ: interface zone (tumor-free fibrotic zone adjacent to tumor burden); Ln-332: laminin-332; NBF: normal breast fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the NZ); NZ: normal zone (normal tissue neighboring the IZ); Poly-HEMA: poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); TZ: tumor zone (tumor burden of IDC).Competing interestsWe declare no conflicts of interest in all participants.Authors' contributionsBGK developed the concept and design of the study, performed the experiments, analyzed and organized the data, and wrote the manuscript.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

        "content": "Tumor-derived matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin-C (TN-C) have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of how these proteins contribute to tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Importantly, these matricellular proteins are known to interact with \u03b19\u03b21 integrin. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor-derived \u03b19\u03b21 integrin may contribute to tumor progression. To clarify the roles of \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis, we used an inhibitory anti-human \u03b19\u03b21 integrin antibody (anti-h\u03b19\u03b21 antibody) and a \u03b19\u03b21 integrin-positive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo orthotopic xenotransplantation model. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor, but not host \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, contributes to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and host-derived OPN production. We also found that CAFs contributed to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and host-derived OPN levels. Consistent with those findings, tumor volume was well-correlated with numbers of CAFs and levels of host-derived OPN. Furthermore, it was shown that the inoculation of D3H2LN cells into mammary fat pads with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), obtained from wild type, but not OPN knock-out mice, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth, thus indicating that CAF-derived OPN enhanced tumor growth. These results suggested that tumor \u03b19\u03b21-mediated signaling plays a pivotal role in generating unique primary tumor tissue microenvironments, which favor lymphatic metastasis and tumor growth. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes lymphatic metastasis through enhancing invasion. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes tumor growth through CAFs. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin enhances the recruitment of CAFs into the primary tumor. Tumor cells induce the production of OPN by CAFs in the primary tumor. CAF-derived OPN promotes tumor growth.",

Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

        "content": "Tetraspanins are transmembrane adaptor proteins involved in the regulation of various fundamental cellular processes. For a number of malignant diseases, the level of expression of members of the tetraspanin family was found to correlate with tumor cell invasiveness, ability to form metastases, and poor clinical outcome. We describe the exact quantification of mRNAs coding for the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD82 and CD151 expressed by mammary carcinoma-derived cell lines that were classified as invasive or non-invasive according to their ability to penetrate collagen-fibroblast gels in vitro. The mean of beta2-microglobulin-normalized expression of CD9 was about 10-fold higher than the mean calculated for CD63 and about 20-fold higher than expression of CD82 and CD151. Direct comparison of tetraspanin expression of invasive and non-invasive cell lines with the Mann-Whitney test revealed a significant correlation for CD63. Grouping of cell lines in relation to threshold values of expression resulted in significant correlations for CD63 (Fisher's exact test p=0.004) and CD151 (p=0.02) but not for CD82 (p=0.065) and CD9 (p=0.168). Expression of CD9, C63 and CD151 was found to be coupled whereas CD82 was expressed independently. This highly significant association points to common mechanisms of gene regulation for this subgroup of tetraspanins. We showed that on basis of absolute amounts of tetraspanin mRNAs, at least in vitro invasiveness is clearly predictable. Our results support the assumption that downregulation of tetraspanins in breast cancer cells is an important step of tumor progression to more malignant phenotypes and underline their important role as mediators in multimolecular membrane protein complexes regulating cell adhesion and migration.",

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

A major modulatory component of the stromal environment is the extracellular matrix, and changes in extracellular matrix composition may therefore be expected to be a key factor in determining tumour behaviour. A consistent feature of the stroma around many breast carcinomas is upregulation of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (TNC).TNC is a complex multifunctional protein that can influence cell behaviour directly and indirectly. It has been shown to promote cell migration, to inhibit focal adhesion formation, to induce cell proliferation and in some cases to act as a cell survival factor. TNC promotes angiogenesis and can induce expression of matrix metalloproteinases, which themselves have been implicated in promoting tumour growth and invasion.Structurally TNC comprises a linear arrangement of domains, with a cysteine-rich N-terminus followed by 14.5 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a region of fibronectin type III-like repeats and a fibrinogen-like domain at the C-terminus (Figure 1). The structure and size of TNC varies as a result of alternative splicing of domains within the fibronectin type III repeat domain; exons 10 to 16 (domains A1 to A4, B, C and D) can undergo alternative splicing either singly or in combination. A number of biologically active sites have been mapped to the fibronectin type III repeat domain, including recognition sites for cell surface receptors such as integrins, cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and annexin II as well as sites susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases. Inclusion or exclusion of different domains in this region can thus generate considerable functional diversity, and up to 22 human splice variants have been identified by RT-PCR analysis.Schematic representation of tenascin-C. Protein structure illustrating the N-terminal tenascin assembly domain, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat region, the fibronectin type III-like region and the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. Exon organisation is shown below (adapted from). Note that the first exon of TNC is not translated and is shown in grey; therefore, exon number 1 in this figure is the first coding exon. UTR, untranslated region.Changes in the profile of TNC isoforms expressed in tumours compared with normal tissue have been described. A switch from the small or truncated form of TNC, which lacks exons 10 to 16, to predominant expression of the large, full-length variant of TNC has been demonstrated in breast, lung and colorectal carcinoma. In glioblastoma, upregulation of an isoform containing exon 15 (domain C), which is rarely detected in normal tissues or malignant epithelium, has been demonstrated. We previously identified induction of two intermediate-sized TNC isoforms in breast cancers and showed that these isoforms can enhance tumour cell invasion; a similar change was demonstrated in ovarian carcinomas. Although the precise significance of altered TNC isoform expression is not well understood, it seems likely that different isoforms have distinct biological function, a concept supported in recent studies.Two less-studied repeat regions have been identified in human, mouse and avian TNC, termed additional domain (AD) 1 and AD2, inserted between domains B and C. Transcripts encoding AD1 have been detected in a variety of cancers, whilst inclusion of AD2 has so far been described only in oral squamous carcinomas. Expression of both repeats has been detected in embryonic avian tissue. Interestingly, in situ hybridisation demonstrated that TNC-AD1 mRNA is abundant at sites of cell motility and branching morphogenesis, suggesting that inclusion of this repeat may contribute to the migration-promoting effect of TNC.The potential to exploit tumour-specific, alternatively spliced isoforms as therapeutic targets has already been demonstrated. The aims of the present study were therefore to establish whether TNC-AD1 and/or TNC-AD2 domains represent tumour-associated isoforms in breast cancer, to determine whether expression of these isoforms correlates with clinicopathological features and tumour subtypes identified by immunohistochemical profiling, and to use in vitro studies to investigate the functional significance of a TNC isoform containing the AD1 domain to tumour cell behaviour. The results of the study show that TNC-AD domains are significantly associated with breast cancers in younger women (age <40 years), with high grade and with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative status. Moreover, in vitro cell culture models show that, in some cell backgrounds, AD1-containing isoforms promote tumour cell invasion and growth at a higher level than that seen with vector controls and other TNC isoforms.Materials and methodsTissues and cellsFresh and/or formalin-fixed tissue was obtained from patients undergoing breast surgery in accordance with Ethics Approval from Leicestershire Research Ethics Committee (06/Q2502/70) and North East London Research Ethics Committee (05/Q0403/199). Since all samples were anonymised there was no requirement from either research ethics committee for informed consent. For isolation of normal cells, tissue was obtained from women undergoing breast reduction surgery who gave informed consent (LNRREC 7054).Two hundred and four samples were analysed from 155 carcinomas selected based on age (68 infiltrating ductal carcinomas from women aged \u226440 years, 62 infiltrating ductal carcinomas from women aged >40 years, 25 infiltrating lobular carcinomas from women aged >40 years), two cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, 14 benign breast lesions including fibroadenoma and fibrocystic change, and 33 normal breast samples from reduction mammoplasty procedures. Tissue was either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or routinely processed and paraffin-embedded following formalin fixation. In selected normal samples, tissue was processed and enzymatically digested to yield single-cell populations, and myoepithelial cells, luminal epithelial cells and fibroblast cells were isolated and characterised as described previously.Breast cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75-1, T47 D, Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-436, HBL-100 and MCF-10A) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Most cell lines were maintained in DMEM plus 2 mM L-glutamine and 10% FBS. ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-436 cell lines were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. The MCF-10A cell line was maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 (Invitrogen Life Science, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and DMEM, 2 mM glutamine supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, insulin (10 \u03bcg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) and epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml) (all SigmaGenosys, Dorset, UK).Transfection of breast carcinoma cell linesBreast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T-47 D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231 and GI-101 were transiently transfected with a novel TNC-14/AD1/16 construct, generated by PCR ligation using previously generated plasmids (TNC-S, TNC-L, TNC-9/14/16) and a Vector control (empty pCMV Script vector) and FuGene HD transfection reagent (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For endogenously TNC-expressing cell lines, co-transfection with the pmaxGFP vector (Lonza, Slough, UK) was also performed to assess transfection efficiency. TNC expression was confirmed using immunohistochemistry for TNC-null cell lines. For all cell lines, expression was also confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Transfection efficiencies for each isoform were confirmed by estimating the proportion of cells that were either immunostained positive or were expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP).RNA isolation and generation of cDNARNA was isolated from frozen tissue for 64 tumour samples, all benign and normal samples and 1 \u00d7 105 cells from each breast cell line using Tri-reagent (Sigma). Seventy tumour tissue samples were available from a previous study in which mRNA was isolated using oligo-dT-linked Dynabeads\u00ae (Dynal, Bromborough, UK). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) or all bead-isolated mRNA was reverse transcribed at 42\u00b0C for 1 hour using Expand-RT (Boehringer Mannheim, Welwyn Garden City, UK) as described previously.Quantitative polymerase chain reactionOwing to limiting amounts of tissue, a nested quantitative PCR approach was devised to amplify TNC exons from frozen tissues. First-round PCR comprised 20 cycles of amplification with primers located in domain 4 (exon 8) and domain 7 (exon 18), to amplify the entire alternative spliced region of TNC (TNC 8/18). Taqman real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) was then applied to survey different exons. Inventoried assays were available for the Tenascin-C invariant exon 17/18 boundary (Applied Biosystems Taqman Assay, Hs01115654_m1) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Applied Biosystems Taqman Assay, Hs99999909_m1) as a housekeeping gene. Primers and probes were developed in-house for AD1 and AD2 (Table 1). For the inventoried Taqman assays, 4 \u03bcl cDNA (diluted 1:10) was analysed in a reaction containing 0.5 \u03bcl probe, 0.5 \u03bcl ultra-pure H2O and 5 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 Taqman Fast PCR mastermix. For the AD1 and AD2 assays, 3.6 \u03bcl cDNA (diluted 1:10) was analysed in a reaction containing 0.2 \u03bcl probe, 0.6 \u03bcl each primer and 5 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 Taqman Fast PCR mastermix.Primer sequences for RT-PCR and asymmetric PCRPrimer\tSequence 5' to 3'\t \tT8 - forward\tCAATCCAGCGACCATCAACG\t \tT18 - reverse\tCGTCCACAGTTACCATGGAG\t \tT16 - reverse\tGTTGTCAACTTCCGGTTCGG\t \tAD1 - forward\tTGGTGGAGAACACTGGCTATGAC\t \tAD1 - reverse\tGGGATCCCCAGCCAAGGT\t \tAD1-FAM-MGB\tCAGTGTGGCAGGAAC\t \tAD2 - forward\tGATCACCCCCATGAGACCAT\t \tAD2 - reverse\tTGATGACAGAGCTGC GAGACA\t \tAD2-FAM-MGB\tTGCTGTCTGTGCCTGG\t \tGAPDH - forward\tAGAACATCATCCCTGCCTC\t \tGAPDH - reverse\tGCCAAATTCGTTGTCATACC\t \tActin antisense\tTCATCACCATTGGCAATGAG\t \tActin sense\tCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGA\t \tAD1 antisense\tGAACCAAAGCCACAGTTGG\t \tAD1 sense\tTAATGACAAAGGCAGTGAG\t \tSense and antisense primers were used to generate single-stranded DNA probes for in situ hybridisation.For all breast cell lines and a subset of the carcinomas (11 carcinomas in women aged \u226440 years and 11 carcinomas in women aged >40 years), AD1, AD2 and exon 17/18 were also assayed directly to enable evaluation of AD1 and AD2 expression relative to total TNC expression (exon 17/18). All quantitative PCR analysis was performed using Step-One qPCR software (Applied Biosystems). The number of cycles necessary to produce a product above background (Ct value) was recorded and, after normalisation to the Ct value for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, the relative expression was determined with the following formula:Determination of TNC transcript expressionThe number of TNC transcripts was calculated using a standard curve generated from nested isoform-specific 8/18 PCR products. This was then used to calculate the number of molecules in a known concentration of sample. A log2 value was then produced from the mean Ct value and normalised against the mean Ct values for the endogenous controls.SequencingAD1 amplicons were analysed by DNA sequencing. Products were sequenced from AD1-F and AD1-R primers, respectively (Table 1), using 1 \u03bcl Big Dye Terminator reactions (ABI, Beverley, UK) and analysed on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. Sequence profiles were analysed using the Chromas software (version 2.3; Technelysium Pty, Ltd Eden Prairie, MN, USA).ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry for cytokeratin (CK) 14 (Sigma), CK5/6 (Sigma) and P-cadherin (BD Biosciences Cowley, UK) was performed on 4 \u03bcm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) serial sections from a subset of 96 breast carcinomas. A standard avidin-biotin complex technique was employed with citrate buffer microwave antigen retrieval for P-cadherin. Normal breast tissue was used as a positive control for all antibodies. Negative controls involved omission of the primary antibody. Sections were scored positive for CK14, CK5/6 or P-cadherin if >10% of the tumour cells were stained. The ER and progesterone receptor were examined in 138 tumour cases, and HER2 examined in 134 cases. All interpretation was carried out by RAW and JLJ.Western blottingLevels of cellular and secreted TNC isoforms were determined by western blotting of transfected cell lysates and serum-free culture media respectively. Cells were transiently transfected and incubated for 24 hours, serum-free media was added and the culture media was collected a further 48 hours after transfection. Protein concentrations were quantified on a Lambda 25 UV/VIS spectrophotometer at 750 nm using the bovine serum albumin protein assay, and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk and 1% Tween for 1 hour and were probed for 1 hour with a rabbit polyclonal TNC antibody (clone H300, recognising all forms of TNC; Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). A secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (1:2,000; Amersham Biosciences), was added for 1 hour and blots were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).In situ localisation of AD1-containing mRNASingle-stranded sense and antisense AD1 and \u03b2-actin control DNA probes were synthesised using asymmetric PCR with specific primers (Table 1) and incorporation of digoxigenin-11-dUTP. In situ hybridisation was carried out on 4 \u03bcm de-waxed rehydrated tissue sections as described previously. The optimum probe concentration (200 to 500 ng/ml) was titrated to eliminate background staining, whilst retaining good signal strength. Negative controls used sense probes, RNase pretreatment of tissue sections and omission of the probe in the hybridisation protocol.Analysis of tumour cell invasionMeasurement of tumour cell invasion was based on modified Boyden Chamber assays using the Fluoroblok tumour cell invasion system as described previously. To measure the direct effect of TNC isoform expression on tumour cell invasion, transiently transfected cells were placed in the upper chamber of the assay and DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS was added to the lower chamber as a chemotactic stimulus - except for the MDA-MB-231 cell line, where DMEM containing 1% (v/v) FCS was used. Assays were monitored in real time up to 48 hours with readings every 2 hours and for a total of six replicates representing three separate transfections. Relative fluorescence to time 0 was used as a measure of invasion for each time point,Analysis of tumour cell growthThe direct effects of TNC isoform expression on tumour cell growth were assessed using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of cell nuclei as described previously. Tumour cells were transfected, and cultured for 48 hours in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in cold acetone/methanol (1:1) for 2 minutes and washed twice with PBS. Cells were then stained using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:20,000) in PBS for 3 minutes and washed twice with PBS. Cell nuclei were examined using a fluorescence microscope and counted using an in-house software program provided by Dr AE Sayan (University of Leicester, UK). Each experiment was performed for a total of nine replicates representing three separate transfections.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Relationships between factors were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test, except for grade where Jonckheere-Terpstra trend analysis was applied. All tests were two-sided and P < 0.05 was considered significant. For functional assays, two-way analysis of variance was performed.ResultsExpression of TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 in breast cell lines and isolated cell populationsNine breast cell lines and isolated normal breast myoepithelial cells and fibroblast cells were screened for expression of TNC 17/18 (an invariant exon boundary, present in all TNC splice variants), AD1 and AD2 by real-time quantitative PCR. TNC 17/18, AD1 and AD2 were absent from ER-positive MCF-7, ZR-75-1, and T-47 D cells (Table 2). Of the AD1-positive cell lines, MDA-MB-436, HBL-100 and primary normal myoepithelial cells expressed the highest levels (>400,000 molecules per 1 \u03bcg RNA). All AD1-positive cell lines and isolated breast cell populations also expressed AD2, but at lower levels. When AD1 and AD2 expression was related to levels of total TNC expression, HS578T, HBL100 and primary myoepithelial cells showed the highest percentages of AD1 (>25% total TNC) and HS578T and MCF10A cells showed the highest AD2 percentages (>5% total TNC).Relative expression of tenascin-C, AD1 and AD2 in cell lines and isolated normal breast cells\tNumber of TNC transcripts (\u00d7103)\t% of total TNC transcripts\t \t\t\t\t \tCell line\tTotal TNC\tAD1\tAD2\tAD1\tAD2\t \tZR-75-1\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t \tT-47D\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t \tMCF-7\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t \tHs578T\t162.651\t41.432\t14.574\t25.47\t8.96\t \tMDA-MB-231\t1,293.947\t44.383\t23.821\t3.43\t1.84\t \tMDA-MB-436\t8,409.526\t479.824\t55.735\t5.71\t0.66\t \tMDA-MB-468\t984.727\t89.74\t28.784\t9.11\t2.92\t \tGI-101\t1,529.834\t143.854\t8.433\t9.40\t0.55\t \tHBL-100\t15,017.045\t6,671.261\t483.212\t44.42\t3.22\t \tMCF-10A\t91.37\t7.399\t6.933\t8.10\t7.59\t \tPrimary MEC\t2,925.394\t1,863.143\t142.39\t63.69\t4.87\t \tPrimary fibroblasts\t5398.821\t87.867\t98.044\t1.63\t1.82\t \tPercentage expression of additional domain (AD) 1 and AD2 relative to the invariant exon 17/18 boundary, as a marker of total tenascin-C (TNC) expression, normalised to the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 control in cell lines and isolated normal breast cells. MEC, myoepithelial cells.Expression of TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 in breast tissuesRNA was successfully isolated from 134 carcinomas, all 14 benign breast tissue samples and 33 normal breast tissue samples, demonstrated by detection of GAPDH by manual PCR. All samples were then analysed by quantitative RT-PCR for expression of the invariant TNC exon 17/18 boundary (total TNC), AD1 and AD2. Total TNC was detected in all samples apart from two of the carcinomas. AD1 expression was demonstrated in 42 (31%) carcinomas, five benign breast tissues and 12 normal breast tissues (eight of which were from women aged <40 years). TNC-AD2 was less frequent than TNC-AD1, being detected in 31 (23.1%) carcinomas, four benign breast tissue samples and four normal breast samples. Nineteen carcinomas, one benign sample and one normal sample expressed both AD1 and AD2.TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 expression in relation to clinicopathological features of carcinomasWhen quantitative data were compared with clinicopathological features of the carcinomas, expression of AD1 was significantly associated with grade 3 tumours, ER-negative status and with younger patient age (\u226440 years) (Table 3). AD2 expression was also significantly associated with younger patient age (Table 3). When the data were stratified by presence of exons only, 19 carcinomas were positive for both AD1 and AD2 - 16 of these were from women aged \u226440 years (P < 0.001; Figure 2), and the highest frequency of TNC-AD1-positive and TNC-AD2-positive tumours was seen in women aged between 31 and 35 years. Neither AD1 nor AD2 showed any association with lymph node status.Relationship between expression of total TNC, TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 and clinicopathological features of tumoursClinicopathological feature\t\tTotal TNC\tTNC-AD1\tTNC-AD2\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tn\tMean Ct (95% CI)\tP\tMean Ct (95% CI)\tP\tMean Ct (95% CI)\tP\t \tAge\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003\u226440 years\t47\t23.5 (21.8 to 25.3)\t0.006\t36.6 (35.4 to 37.7)\t<0.001\t37.7 (36.7 to 38.6)\t0.001\t \t\u2003>40 years\t87\t26.5 (25.7 to 27.3)\t\t38.7 (38.1 to 39.3)\t\t39.1 (38.5 to 39.7)\t\t \tTumour type\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003IDC\t109\t25.4 (24.4 to 26.4)\t0.554\t37.8 (37.2 to 38.4)\t0.079\t38.7 (38.2 to 39.2)\t0.760\t \t\u2003ILC\t25\t25.6 (24.7 to 26.5)\t\t38.6 (37.1 to 40.0)\t\t38.3 (36.5 to 39.9)\t\t \tGrade\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003I\t14\t27.6 (25.9 to 29.4)\t0.109\t39.1 (37.9 to 40.3)\t0.017\t39.8 (39.3 to 40.2)\t0.066\t \t\u2003II\t63\t25.7 (24.6 to 26.7)\t\t38.3 (37.4 to 39.1)\t\t38.7 (37.9 to 39.5)\t\t \t\u2003III\t57\t24.7 (23.2 to 26.1)\t\t37.3 (36.4 to 38.2)\t\t38.2 (37.4 to 39.0)\t\t \tLymph node\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003Positive\t63\t25.4 (24.2 to 26.6)\t0.802\t37.9 (37.2 to 38.8)\t0.978\t38.8 (38.2 to 39.4)\t0.900\t \t\u2003Negative\t68\t25.5 (24.4 to 26.7)\t\t37.9 (37.1 to 38.8)\t\t38.5 (37.7 to 39.3)\t\t \t\u2003Not known\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tOestrogen receptor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003Positive\t89\t25.6 (24.6 to 26.5)\t0.413\t38.2 (37.6 to 38.9)\t0.011\t38.7 (38.1 to 39.3)\t0.316\t \t\u2003Negative\t31\t24.1 (22.2 to 26.1)\t\t36.7 (35.3 to 38.0)\t\t38.1 (36.9 to 39.3)\t\t \t\u2003Not known\t14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tProgesterone receptor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003Positive\t79\t25.4 (24.5 to 26.4)\t0.431\t37.9 (37.2 to 38.4)\t0.441\t38.8 (38.2 to 39.3)\t0.641\t \t\u2003Negative\t36\t24.5 (22.6 to 26.4)\t\t37.6 (36.4 to 38.7)\t\t38.1 (36.8 to 39.5)\t\t \t\u2003Not known\t19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tHer-2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003Positive\t17\t23.3 (20.5 to 26.2)\t0.232\t37.6 (35.9 to 39.3)\t0.639\t38.2 (36.6 to 39.8)\t0.452\t \t\u2003Negative\t81\t25.1 (24.2 to 26.1)\t\t37.8 (37.0 to 38.6)\t\t38.7 (38.0 to 39.4)\t\t \t\u2003Not known\t36\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tBasal 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003Positive\t23\t24.3 (22.2 to 26.4)\t0.605\t36.9 (35.3 to 38.6)\t0.170\t38.4 (37.2 to 39.7)\t0.746\t \t\u2003Negative\t109\t25.4 (24.5 to 26.3)\t\t38.0 (37.4 to 38.7)\t\t38.6 (37.9 to 39.1)\t\t \t\u2003Not known\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tBasal 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\u2003Positive\t22\t25.8 (23.1 to 28.4)\t0.103\t37.6 (35.9 to 39.4)\t0.960\t38.5 (37.3 to 39.6)\t1.000\t \t\u2003Negative\t51\t23.2 (21.4 to 25.0)\t\t37.6 (36.6 to 38.7)\t\t38.5 (37.7 to 39.3)\t\t \t\u2003Not known\t61\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \tCI, confidence interval; Ct, number of cycles necessary to produce a product above background; IDC: infiltrating ductal carcinoma; ILC: infiltrating lobular carcinoma; TNC, tenascin-C.Distribution of additional domain-positive and additional domain-negative breast carcinomas in relation to patient age.

Mann-Whitney tests were used to calculate P values.TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 expression was also analysed in relation to the tumour subtype, as determined by immunohistochemical profiling. Nielsen and colleagues considered that lack of ER and HER2 and presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1) and CK5/6 could identify basal-like carcinomas. Carey and colleagues defined basal-like carcinomas as ER-negative, PR-negative, Her2-negative, CK5/6-positive and/or CK14-positive. There has been debate as to whether triple-negative cancers (that is, ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative) are the same as basal-like tumours. Rakha and colleagues have recently proposed that CK5/6 and/or CK14 can be used to define basal-like carcinomas irrespective of the expression of the other markers. We therefore chose to examine a range of putative basal markers (ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, CK14, and P-cadherin) and compared the expression of these with AD1and AD2 expression.Immunohistochemical profiling and TNC-AD1/AD2 status was known in 132 cases (59 women aged \u226440 years and 73 women aged >40 years) for basal phenotype 1 defined as triple-negative tumours, and in 73 cases (44 women aged \u226440 years and 29 women aged >40 years) for basal phenotype 2 defined as CK5/6-positive and/or CK14-positive tumours. There was no significant relationship between TNC-AD1/AD2 status and either basal phenotype (Table 3). There was also no relationship between TNC-AD1/AD2 status and either HER-2 or P-cadherin expression (data not shown).The AD1 domain is part of novel intermediate-sized TNC isoformsSequencing was carried out on two tumour samples that showed expression of two different-sized AD1-containing isoforms (Figure 3a), the largest of which was tumour specific. Blast sequence analysis confirmed that AD1 was located within one of two different intermediate-sized TNC transcripts between exons 9/14 and either exons 15/16 or exon 16 alone (Figure 3b; sequence of AD1 [GenBank:EU295718]). Neither isoform contained AD2. Analysis of normal breast cell populations isolated from reduction mammoplasties demonstrated a single-isoform TNC-14/AD1/16 in myoepithelial cell populations from five separate donors and in five out of 12 fibroblast populations.Identification of two distinct additional domain-1-containing tenascin-C isoforms.

Specificity of signal was established using sense probes, which were consistently negative. Two carcinomas, which were negative for TNC-AD1 by quantitative RT-PCR, were also negative by in situ hybridisation. In six TNC-AD1-positive breast carcinomas, the TNC-AD1 antisense probe localised to tumour cells and not to stromal cells (Figure 4a); and in the associated myoepithelial cells around large histologically normal ducts, there was a lower level of expression detected (Figure 4b).In situ localisation of tenascin-C additional domain 1 to tumour cells and normal myoepithelial cells.

Transient transfection was used to determine the direct effects of TNC isoforms (TNC-S, TNC-9/14/16, TNC-14/AD1/16) on invasion in the three TNC null cell lines (MCF-7, T-47 D, ZR-75-1) and in two cell lines with endogenous TNC expression (MDA-MB-231 and GI-101) (Figure 5). All cell lines transfected with TNC-S showed no significant increase in invasion compared with vector controls. TNC-14/AD1/16-transfected MCF-7, T-47 D, MDA-MB-231 and GI-101 cells showed increased invasion over vector controls, which became significant with increasing time (Table 5).

(b) Quantitative RT-PCR of total TNC transcripts (exons 17/18) from cells transfected with TNC constructs.TNC-9/14/16-transfected MCF-7 and GI-101 cells also showed increased invasion over vector controls with time. No significant increase in invasion was observed in T-47 D, ZR-75-1 or MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Figure 5 and Table 5). A similar trend in invasion was observed when compared with TNC-S; however, significance appeared at a later time point (Table 5). In MCF-7 cells we also compared mean invasion induced by TNC-14/AD1/16 and TNC-L (this isoform contains all of the exons in the alternatively spliced region, with the exception of AD1 and AD2). TNC-14/AD1/16 significantly enhanced tumour cell invasion over cells expressing TNC-L (P < 0.001) (Figure 5a:v). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of transfected TNC expression showed equivalent levels between constructs in all cell lines - except in MCF-7 cells, which showed TNC-S to be expressed at a higher level (Figure 5b).Transient transfection was also used to determine the direct effects of TNC isoforms (TNC-S, TNC-9/14/16, TNC-14/AD1/16) on cell growth in MCF-7, T-47 D and MDA-MB-231 cells. A significant increase in cell number was observed 48 hours post transfection in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing TNC-9/14/16 and TNC-14/AD1/16 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively, for MCF-7 cells; P < 0.001 for both isoforms in MDA-MB-231 cells) compared with the vector control. Furthermore, a significant increase was observed in MCF-7 cells overexpressing TNC-S (P < 0.01). No significant increase was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing TNC-S. MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing TNC-9/14/16 and TNC-14/AD1/16, however, showed a significant increase in cell numbers compared with TNC-S (P < 0.001 for both). No significant differences were found between isoforms and vector controls for T-47 D cells (Figure 6).Direct effect of tenascin-C isoform expression on tumour cell growth.

The present study has shown that expression of only one AD1-containing variant (TNC-14/AD1/15/16) was cancer specific, but higher mRNA levels of all AD1 and AD2 variants were associated with high-grade, ER-negative breast cancers, and cancers arising in younger women. Detection of AD2-containing isoforms was less frequent and at lower levels; we therefore focused on determining the functional significance of AD1 variants and showed that the TNC-14/AD1/16 isoform promoted invasion and growth.The present study analysed a series of breast cancer cell lines and also isolated cell populations from normal breast (n > 5). Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated expression of TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 isoforms in all TNC-positive lines, which were also ER-negative and were characterised by aggressive behaviour. Analysis of isolated cell populations from normal breast showed that the predominant source of AD1 and AD2 expression is the myoepithelium. Isolated stromal fibroblasts, the source of most TNC isoforms, showed only low-level expression that was not detected for AD1 by in situ hybridisation. The HBL-100 cell line also showed a high level of expression, and this exhibits myoepithelial cell characteristics. AD1 was not detectable in normal tissues by in situ hybridisation; but was detected at a low level in isolated enriched populations of a single normal cell type. For the breast cancers, the cells expressing AD1 were predominantly malignant epithelial cells rather than fibroblasts. Sequencing of the two AD1 variants identified in cancers, with AD1 incorporated into an isoform containing exons 15 plus 16 or exon 16 alone, are distinct from those described by Mighell and colleagues. In their study of oral tissues, AD1-containing isoforms were identified in normal and reactive lesions as well as tumour tissue, with TNC-AD2 expression rare but tumour specific. In the present study, the TNC-14/AD1/15/16 variant was cancer specific as this was not detected in any of the normal tissues or isolated cell populations.We demonstrated that the TNC-14/AD1/16 isoform significantly increased breast cancer cell invasion and growth. The largest TNC isoform (TNC-L) has been frequently associated with an invasive phenotype, as have two other prominent isoforms containing exons 16 and 14/16. The TNC-14/AD1/16 isoform showed a much greater effect on tumour cell invasion than TNC-L in MCF-7 cells, however, suggesting that these intermediate-sized isoforms may be most biologically relevant. TNC-14/AD1/16 also produced a greater effect than the TNC-9/14/16 isoform, but this was only significant for MCF-7 and T-47 D cells. The fully truncated TNC isoform (TNC-S) showed no significant effect on tumour cell invasion, consistent with previous reports.The TNC-14/AD1/16 isoform was also shown to increase cell growth in MCF-7 cells at a similar level to isoform TNC-9/14/16, supporting our previous data. In cells that endogenously express TNC (that is, MDA-MB-231), however, transfection with TNC-14/AD1/16 had a much greater effect on cell growth. The precise mechanisms leading to increased cell invasion and growth in the breast are unclear. Ruiz and colleagues and Lange and colleagues have associated triggering of glioma cell migration with a simultaneous mechanism of competitive inhibition of syndecan-4 binding of fibronectin and signalling by lysophosphatidic acid and platelet-derived growth factor (reviewed in). Furthermore, TNC has been shown to be susceptible to degradation by matrix metalloproteinases, which can reveal cryptic sites present in the TNC molecule - of which AD1 could be a potential site. Further work using peptide fragments containing AD1 could help elucidate these functions.High expression of either AD1-containing or AD2-containing mRNA in breast cancers was significantly associated with young patient age (\u226440 years). AD1 expression was also associated with lack of ER and grade 3 tumours, both of which are features of cancers in younger women. These results correlate with findings by Helleman and colleagues, who suggested that high TNC expression could be an indirect marker for a defective ER pathway due to an inverse correlation between TNC mRNA and ER protein expression. Breast carcinomas in young women exhibit a particularly aggressive phenotype compared with tumours arising in postmenopausal women. This may in part be attributed to the greater frequency of high-grade tumours in young women. There is evidence that tumours in young women are biologically distinct, however, being associated with poorer survival independent of tumour grade and stage and showing a higher frequency of loss of heterozygosity compared with grade-matched and stage-matched postmenopausal cancers. The association of AD1 and AD2 expression with younger age supports the hypothesis that these tumours are biologically distinct.Over recent years there has been increasing recognition of a subgroup of breast carcinomas characterised by high levels of expression of genes and proteins normally associated with the myoepithelial or basal cell population of the breast. This basal tumour subtype exhibits a poorer prognosis than other subgroups, occurs with high frequency in BRCA1-mutated tumours and occurs more frequently in younger women. To address whether the TNC-AD1 (myoepithelial-associated) and TNC-AD2 isoforms were associated with basal features, we compared TNC-AD1 status with expression of putative basal markers. There was no association of TNC-AD1 expression with either the triple-negative or CK 5/6-positive and/or CK14-positive subtypes, or with any of the other putative basal markers. This may be due to relatively small numbers of basal cases available for analysis, but a larger study was precluded by the need for fresh tissue for analysis.ConclusionsThe present study has shown a highly significant association between expression of TNC-AD1 and TNC-AD2 and carcinomas arising in young women (\u226440 years), and TNC-AD1 is sometimes incorporated into a novel tumour-associated TNC isoform not detected in normal tissues. The association of TNC-AD1 expression with tumours arising in young women and also with high-grade and ER-negative tumours make it a plausible target for development of novel therapies. Functional studies showed that the TNC-14/AD1/16 isoform can significantly increase breast cancer cell invasion and growth, to a greater extent than the previously described tumour-associated TNC-9/14/16 isoform. This raises interesting questions regarding the functional significance of TNC isoforms containing the AD domains.AbbreviationsAD: additional domain; CK: cytokeratin; Ct: number of cycles necessary to produce a product above background; ER: oestrogen receptor; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS: foetal bovine serum; FFPE: formalin-fixed: paraffin-embedded; GFP: green fluorescent protein; H & E: haemotoxylin and eosin; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RT: reverse transcriptase; TNC: tenascin-C; TNC-9/16: tenascin-C with only exon 16 of variable region; TNC-9/14/16: tenascin-C with only exons 14 and 16 of variable region; TNC-14/AD1/16: tenascin-C with only exons 14: AD1 and 16 of variable region; TNC-L: tenascin-C largest splice variant; TNC-S: tenascin-C fully truncated splice variant.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsJHP, JAS and DSG created the TNC isoform expression vectors.

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs.

The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among females and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. Metastasis accounts for the vast majority of patient mortality. During disease progression, distinct changes occur in the extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and biochemical composition, which facilitate primary tumor growth and successful metastasis. The glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) is of particular interest as FN expression in primary mammary tumors is strongly correlated with decreased patient survival for all BC subtypes.In the primary tumor, FN and collagen fibrils accumulate as the tumor develops, which causes an increase in tissue stiffness. This matrix stiffness promotes proliferation, increases tumor cell aggressiveness, and is believed to bolster the number of cancer stem cells. Recent research has indicated that FN and collagen fibrils accumulate parallel to the primary tumor border during premetastatic growth. However, in invasive tumors, these fibrils realign perpendicular to the tumor border, acting as \u201ctracks\u201d for tumor cell migration through the basement membrane.Growing evidence suggests that the primary tumor also primes distant organs in the development of a premetastatic niche to aid metastasis. In mouse models, FN deposition is upregulated in premetastatic niches. This increased FN content is believed to aid disseminated cancer cell recruitment to the secondary organ and may also promote metastatic initiation after extravasation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, have recently been shown as a key source of endocrine communication from the primary tumor. In particular, EVs have been reported as a major cause of FN accumulation in the premetastatic niche. They have also been connected to the recruitment of tumor-supporting stromal cells and the enhanced attachment of disseminated tumor cells. We recently demonstrated that conditioning pulmonary fibroblasts with EVs from BC cells could drastically alter the subsequent growth of epithelial BC cells in a FN-dependent manner. Currently, it is unclear what role BC cells have in the accumulation of extracellular FN. Soluble FN is found extensively in the plasma (300 \u00b5g/mL). However, FN in solution has a compact confirmation and will not self-assemble into fibrils as a function of concentration. Instead, fibrillarization of FN to form a matrix requires an exogenous stimulus. The FN must be stretched to expose the cryptic FN\u2013FN binding site and enable fibrillar matrix assembly. This typically occurs through cell-mediated processes via integrin binding (primarily the \u03b15\u03b21 integrin) to the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) domain. Because FN assembly is a multi-stage process, BC cells may secrete increased levels of soluble FN, may be capable of organizing FN fibrils, or may contribute to increased FN matrix production by the non-cancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment,. Recent studies by our group suggest that breast cancer cells that undergo epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) can produce large amounts of globular FN, but they do not actively participate in matrix deposition. In this work, we compared the accumulation of FN at the primary tumor and in lung metastasis using histology and tissue clearing techniques. We systematically compared intracellular and extracellular FN levels among BC cell types with varied phenotypes, metastatic potentials, and drug sensitivities using immunoblot analysis and decellularization techniques. We found phenotypic-dependent FN deposition by conditioned fibroblasts, with differential responses when modeling paracrine and endocrine signaling. Overall, our findings shed light on site-dependent and phenotype-dependent fibroblast conditioning, resulting in differential FN matrix accumulation as it relates to changes in the tumor microenvironment throughout primary tumor development, invasion, and macrometastasis. 2. Results2.1. Fibronectin Accumulates Transiently In VivoTo establish FN accumulation during disease progression, we injected 4T1 BC cells expressing luciferase into the mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice and tracked primary tumor growth and lung metastasis via luminescence over 25 days (Figure 1A). Luminescence increased as expected in the primary tumor over time (Figure 1B). Small differences were quantified in thoracic luminescence levels from day 15, but overt metastases were not seen in any mice until day 20, and not consistently until day 25 (Figure 1C). Whole tumors were cleared, and immunostaining revealed an increase in FN expression and overall density over time. The edges of the tumor also appeared serrated on days 20 and 25, indicating possible infiltration into the surrounding healthy tissue (Figure S1). H&E staining of lung sections indicated an accumulation of extracellular tissue, disrupting the natural honeycomb structure seen in control lungs (Figure 1D). There was a significant increase in lung tissue density from day 15 onward as compared to nontumor bearing mice that were sacrificed on day 25 (Figure 1E). Similarly, there were significantly more Ki-67 positive cells in the lung tissue starting on day 15 (Figure 1D,F). FN staining of the lung tissue indicated a transient increase, which was significant on days 10 and 15, before falling to a level that was not significantly different than control mice (Figure 1D,G). Cleared whole lobes were used to confirm changes in FN accumulation and tissue volume (Figure 1H).2.2. Fibronectin Is Not Fibrillarized by Breast Cancer CellsWe performed immunoblotting of the whole cell lysate (WCL), conditioned media (CM), and ECM deposited by 15 different BC cell lines (Figure 2A). Human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE) and human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) were used as control cells. HMLE-TG2 cells overexpress transglutaminase 2 (TG2). TG2 is an enzyme that can catalyze protein crosslinking of various extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin, collagen, and FN. Crosslinking via TG2 is linked to fibrosis and cancer progression. We have also recently shown that TG2 emerges in metastatic BC cells that have undergone induction and reversal of EMT and can enhance metastasis if overexpressed in primary tumor cells. The fifteen BC cell lines included multiple subtypes, drug sensitivities, invasive potentials, and represented various stages of the metastatic cascade. Cells were grouped according to similar lineage for immunoblotting (Figure 2A). We first investigated a HER2-transformed progression series. We used HER2-transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HME2) that are capable of primary tumor formation but have no metastatic potential. Within the progression series, we used a HME2 line that had undergone drug-induced EMT via acquired resistance to the EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitor, Lapatinib (LAPR). Separately, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) was induced in the HME2 line via a 4-week treatment with TGF-\u03b21 followed by a 2-week withdrawal to create the Post TGF-\u03b2 line. This EMP induction was sufficient to induce metastasis upon mammary fat pad engraftment. Subculture of the resulting bone metastases established the epithelial BM line. Re-engraftment into the mammary fat pad and subculture of the resulting metastases in the lymph nodes gave rise to the BM Lym Mets line. The BMNR and BMAR lines were established by prolonged treatment of the BM cells with the pan-ErbB inhibitors, Neratinib and Afatinib, respectively, resulting in acquired stable resistance to these compounds. MCF10A-HER2 cells are an MCF10A derivative line that overexpress HER2 and are considered premalignant. The remaining cell lines were from triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). The MCF10CA1a (Ca1a) and MCF10Ca1h (Ca1h) cells are derived from the RAS-transformed MCF-10AT cells and represent epithelial and mesenchymal populations, respectively. D2.OR and D2A1 are two isogenic murine lines derived from mammary tumors originating from the D2 hyperplastic alveolar nodule (HAN) line. D2.OR cells exhibit characteristics of tumor cell dormancy in vivo and in Matrigel culture assays, while the D2A1 cells do not enter dormancy in soft 3D matrices and rapidly produce pulmonary tumors in mice. The MDA-MB-231 (231) cell line is a widely used, invasive, TNBC line that was isolated from a pleural effusion of a patient with invasive ductal carcinoma. It is a common model of late-stage BC. Conversely, the BT-549 cell line was obtained from the primary tumor of a patient with invasive ductal carcinoma, but is also classified as basal B and claudin-low. Lastly, the 4T1 cell line is one of four sublines derived from the 410.4 tumor, which was isolated from a spontaneous mammary tumor in an MMTV+ BALB/c mouse. It is highly tumorigenic and invasive, and efficiently metastasizes to multiple sites that are also common in human BC including the lungs, liver, brain, and bone.Our results indicated that a mature FN matrix was only formed from the fibroblast control cells and from the HMLE cells overexpressing TG2. While no BC cell line could produce a robust fibrillar FN matrix after 3 days, we observed sporadic deposition of FN, most notably in the D2 series, that was below the detectable level of immunoblotting (Figure 2B and Figure 3). The majority of BC cell lines (10/15) expressed FN in their whole cell lysate (Figure 2A, Figures S2 and S6\u2013S8). Intracellular FN expression was not diminished after acquired drug resistance (BMNR and BMAR lines) and was enhanced after EMT as observed in the LAPR and post TGF-\u03b2 cells compared to the HME2 parental line. Similarly, the majority of BC cells were able to secrete soluble FN into the media (12/15) (Figure 2A). The extracellular FN deposition was verified by immunostaining of decellularized cell layers. The majority of slides were completely negative, with a minority showing spots of fibrillar FN (Figure 2B). This staining confirms that BC cells can release soluble FN, but these cells do not readily organize a robust FN matrix. This result was irrespective of ascorbic acid addition to the media (Figure S2).2.3. Fibroblasts Organize Exogenous Fibronectin into a Fibrillar NetworkNext, we explored the relationship between soluble FN produced by tumor cells and fibroblast matrix deposition. To this end, we depleted FN production in HLF cells through lentiviral-mediated transduction using two distinct shRNAs (shFN30 and shFN32). Depletion of intracellular levels of FN was verified by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Figure 4A and Figure S8). Immunostaining of decellularized slides indicated that no FN matrix was produced when the FN-depleted cells were cultured in standard serum-free media (Figure 4B). However, when soluble FN was added (10 \u00b5g/mL and 20 \u00b5g/mL), a fibrillar FN matrix was established that was indistinguishable from the matrix produced by wild-type HLF cells (Figure 4B and Figure 2B). In addition, when FN-depleted HLF cells were cultured in serum-free media conditioned by Ca1h cells for 72 h, a FN matrix was also established (Figure 4B). Next, we sought to establish whether wild-type HLFs would incorporate exogenous soluble FN into a fibrillar matrix or if these cells would selectively utilize endogenous FN. This was accomplished in two ways. First, exogenous soluble FN was fluorescently labeled and incorporated into the serum-free media. This was performed for 3-day (Figure 5A) and 1-day culturing periods (Figure 5B) at various exogenous FN concentrations. In all cases, the exogenous FN was incorporated into a larger endogenous FN matrix. In these regions of clustered ECM, there was no difference in the amount of FN deposited with or without the exogenous supply (Figure 5D). However, under the shorter culturing period and higher exogenous FN concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL), there was a significantly larger correlation coefficient. This Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient is a measure of how similar the two image channels are, from 0 to 1, with 1 occurring if they are identical. The significantly larger value in the shorter culturing condition indicates that a larger percentage of the total FN matrix came from exogenous sources (Figure 5C). To verify these results, we used the non-canonical amino acid, azidohomoalanine (Aha), to label the proteins produced by wild-type HLF cells. Aha is a methionine (Met) analog that has a bio-orthogonal handle (azide) and is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins (NSPs) using the native translational machinery of the cell. The NSPs can be visualized by using an alkyne-labeled fluorophore that is clicked to Aha via azide-alkyne cycloaddition. As before, HLFs deposited a FN matrix after 48 h with or without the addition of 10 ug/mL soluble FN in the media. However, there was significantly less accumulation of Aha-labeled proteins in cultures given exogenous FN (Figure 5E,F). This confirmed that HLFs utilized exogenous and endogenous FN to form one indistinguishable FN matrix. 2.4. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Plasticity Enhanced Fibronectin Accumulation in Paracrine SignalingWe next evaluated FN matrix deposition from HLFs after 48 h of exposure to CM from BC cells to mimic soluble factor conditioning via paracrine signaling. To delineate the effect of BC cell phenotype on HLF conditioning, we used media from the Ca1a cells, Ca1h cells, and Ca1h cells that had been specifically depleted of FN expression (Ca1h shFN30). Finally, to investigate the role of tumor heterogeneity on matrix production, co-cultures consisting of 50:50 Ca1a:Ca1h cells and Ca1a:Ca1h shFN30 cells were also utilized. HLFs given serum-free media produced a mature interconnected FN matrix within 48 h (Figure 6A). However, the network of matrix proteins was not confluent in the entire culture area (Figure S3). When given 10 \u00b5g/mL of soluble FN, significantly more FN matrix was present across the entire culture area (Figure 6C). Here, and in all subsequent experiments, FN accumulation was quantified from tilescan images of the full culture dish (Figure S3) for unbiased measurements. We analyzed the alignment of the FN fibrils by fitting a gaussian curve to the directionality distribution. The spread of the gaussian curve indicates the dispersion of fibril orientation where less dispersion correlates with a more aligned network of fibrils (Figure S4). At least three regions, approximately 0.7 mm2 each, of highest FN accumulation were analyzed per condition. Therefore, in the Ca1a CM cultures, which did not have regions of high FN accumulation, the dispersion was not quantified. We observed that serum-free cultured HLFs produced highly-aligned matrices, and that the addition of soluble FN did not alter this architecture (Figure 6A,B).When HLF cells were cultured in CM from Ca1a cells, FN fibrillarization was diminished (Figure 6C). We then sought to investigate whether the Ca1a CM simply depressed FN matrix organization in HLFs, or if these factors would induce matrix breakdown (Figure 6E). HLFs were cultured in serum-free media for 4 or 7 days as controls. In the third group, HLFs were cultured in serum-free media for 4 days and then switched to Ca1a CM for 3 days. The HLFs were able to create a robust FN matrix within 4 days that covered the entire culture well (Figure S3). As such, there was no significant difference in the accumulation of FN between the 4 and 7 day culturing groups (Figure 6E). In cultures switched to Ca1a CM, there was also not a significant change in the amount of FN matrix (Figure 6E). These results suggest that the Ca1a CM inhibits accumulation of FN matrix deposition but does not alter the existing matrix. Interestingly, the depression of FN was not recapitulated by Ca1h shFN30 CM. HLFs cultured in Ca1h shFN30 CM produced on average more FN matrix, but the increase was not statistically significant compared to that of serum-free culturing (Figure 6C). Matrices from HLFs cultured in Ca1h and Ca1h shFN30 CM were also significantly less aligned than serum-free HLF matrices (Figure 6B). The global architecture of the Ca1h shFN30 CM group appeared similar to that of HLFs cultured with CM taken from a co-culture of Ca1a and Ca1h cells (Figure 6A and Figure S3). The level of accumulation seen from Ca1a:Ca1h CM culturing was the largest on average, producing more than either the Ca1a or Ca1h CMs individually (Figure 6C). The number of HLFs on the entire culture surface was quantified for each condition after 48 h. CM from Ca1a, Ca1h, and Ca1a:Ca1h shFN30 co-cultures resulted in statistically fewer HLFs (Figure 6D). Culturing HLFs in Ca1a CM also resulted in visually less healthy HLF cells (Figure 6A). There was partial agreement with the number of HLF cells and the overall FN accumulation per condition. Specifically, Ca1a and Ca1a:Ca1h shFN30 CM conditioning resulted in significantly lower FN accumulation and fewer HLF cells. However, the difference in FN accumulation cannot be explained solely by the promotion or inhibition of HLF population growth. For example, conditioning with Ca1h CM resulted in significantly fewer HLFs, without statistically affecting FN accumulation. Conversely, we observe no statistical difference in the number of HLFs after conditioning with Ca1h shFN30 and Ca1a:Ca1h CM, although both conditions resulted in an upward trend of FN accumulation (Figure 6D).An ELISA was performed to quantify the amount of FN in each conditioned media sample (Figure 6D). As expected, the Ca1a and Ca1h shFN30 CM samples had very little soluble FN. The CM from Ca1h cells had a similar concentration of FN as the 10 ug/mL used for the exogenous group. Unsurprisingly, the Ca1a:Ca1h co-culture had less FN than the Ca1h media, as the number of each cell type seeded was halved to maintain the same total cell count. The concentration of FN was slightly (12%) higher than what would be calculated using these estimated cell numbers, despite the Ca1a cells having a faster proliferation rate. TGF-\u03b21 has been shown to be a major regulator of FN production and a rapid inducer of fibrillogenesis. We therefore investigated the concentration of TGF-\u03b21 for each CM (Figure 6D). Our results show that media from native Ca1a epithelial BC cells have undetectable levels of TGF-\u03b21 and media from Ca1h mesenchymal BC cells have >400 pg/mL of TGF-\u03b21. Interestingly, the Ca1h shFN30 CM retains approximately half as much TGF-\u03b21. In addition, while Ca1a:Ca1h CM retained approximately 62% soluble FN compared to the homogeneous controls, the co-cultured CM retained approximately 34% TGF-\u03b21 concentration. 2.5. A Mesenchymal Phenotype Enhanced Fibronectin Accumulation in Endocrine SignalingEVs released by BC cells at the primary tumor have been identified as major contributors of early metastatic niche conditioning. We have previously demonstrated that FN is fibrillarized on the surface of EVs from some BC cells, and that EVs from these BC cells enhanced pulmonary tumor growth. Here, EVs were enriched from Ca1a-, Ca1h-, and Ca1h shFN30-conditioned medias and added to HLF cultures. Immunoblotting indicated that Ca1h-derived EVs had FN, while Ca1h shFN30 and Ca1a EVs displayed little to no FN expression (Figure 7A). Of note, bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein analyses indicated that EV-enriched preparations from Ca1h cultures had 6 times the protein and Ca1h shFN30 EV preparations had 3 times the protein as compared to Ca1a cultures.Ca1a EVs did not improve matrix deposition by HLF cells. There was also no clear depression of total FN production due to Ca1a EVs as compared to the results obtained from unfractionated Ca1a CM, but no mature fibrillar architecture developed (Figure 7B,D). Therefore, dispersion was not quantified from Ca1a EV cultures. Ca1h EV conditioning significantly enhanced FN matrix deposition (Figure 7D and Figure S5). Interestingly, HLF cells conditioned with Ca1h EVs displayed an aligned architecture compared to what was seen from Ca1h CM (Figure 7B,C). Ca1h shFN30 EV conditioning similarly resulted in significantly more FN accumulation, but no mature architecture developed (Figure 7B,D). Conditioning HLFs with EV-enriched solutions from Ca1h and Ca1h shFN30 cells resulted in significantly more HLFs after 48 h, which corresponded directly with the increased total FN accumulation (Figure 7E).When Aha was added to control HLF cells conditioned with Ca1h EVs, the bulk of the deposited FN matrix was shown to be NSPs (Figure 8A,B). There was no significant difference between the ratio of Aha/FN signal between control and Ca1h-EV-conditioned HLF cells (Figure 8C). The increase in FN accumulation was therefore not from HLFs directly utilizing the FN associated with the Ca1h EVs. 3. DiscussionWork from our lab and others has demonstrated that the accumulation of extracellular FN is an indication of advancing BC disease. Here, we investigated FN matrix formation in the primary tumor and metastatic lungs in vivo. We then systematically analyzed the intracellular, soluble, and extracellular levels of FN derived from BC cells. This approach revealed limited fibronectin deposition by any BC cell. We therefore investigated changes in fibrillar FN formation when fibroblasts were exposed to varied BC media fractions and demonstrated that matrix formation by fibroblasts can be influenced by BC cells. Using cleared primary 4T1 tumors, we observed mostly intracellular FN in the tumors within the first 10 d. However, by 15 d, we began to see the development of a robust matrix, and by 25 d we observe aligned tracks of FN that indicate potential routes of dissemination (Figure S1). Within the lungs, we observed a transient increase in FN expression from days 10\u201315 and a steady increase in Ki-67 staining beginning on day 15. These occurred before overt metastasis was seen, beginning on day 20, and before the formation of aligned FN tracks (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Due to the lack of a bioluminescent signal at earlier time points where Ki-67 staining was observed and the location of these proliferating cells throughout the lungs rather than in micrometastatic foci, these appear to be resident stromal cells. Similar observations in the lungs have been made by Kaplan et al., using the Lewis lung carcinoma model. They reported an increase in FN in the premetastatic lungs from days 3\u201314 after tumor cell injection in mice. They also noted an increase in proliferation by resident fibroblast-like stromal cells in the lungs due to signaling from the primary tumor. These results suggest that fibrillar FN must be down- and upregulated in target organs over time to facilitate the development of macrometastases.By comparing non-transformed and tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, loss of intracellular FN expression has been previously correlated with malignant transformation. A loss of FN in the WCL was seen when comparing the HMLE to the HER2 transformed HME2 cell lines. Furthermore, epithelial tumor cells, overall, displayed no intracellular FN, including the Ca1a cells (Figures S2 and S7). However, induction of EMT enhanced intracellular FN levels. While the mesenchymal phenotype is often associated with increased invasion and resistance to anoikis, macrometastases were not detected from homogenous Ca1h tumors. Research on early disseminated cancer cells and the latent reactivation suggests that while EMT or partial-EMT enables dissemination, cellular plasticity is required for these cells to enter a pro-growth phase and form clinically-detectable macrometastases. In early disease progression, we have also shown that promoting EMP through the induction of a transient mesenchymal phenotype transforms a non-metastatic tumorigenic cell line into an effective metastasizer. It is thus apparent that intracellular and autocrine FN expression is intimately tied with EMT and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) status and requires transient expression at different stages of the metastatic cascade. Interestingly, we observed that BC cells readily secrete FN, as evidenced by its presence in the CM in 12/15 BC cell lines investigated. However, despite producing significant levels of FN, these cells did not readily form a mature fibrillar network (Figure 2).Therefore, we investigated if fibroblasts could produce a fibrillar FN matrix using FN produced by cancer cells. We observed that fibroblasts do assemble an ECM network using exogenously supplied proteins, and the matrix network properties are dependent on the source of the FN (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Past work indicates that cancer-associated fibroblasts are a major effector of ECM production and remodeling in the tumor microenvironment. Fibroblasts, often resident stromal fibroblasts, transition slowly into cancer associated fibroblasts via several mechanisms, including contact signals with BC cells, physiological stress, and soluble factors from the tumor. Here, we investigated FN accumulation and alignment from fibroblasts conditioned by BC cell CM or EVs as a mimic of paracrine and endocrine signaling, respectively. For HLFs conditioned with BC CM, cultures with phenotypic heterogeneity resulted in the most FN accumulation, while epithelial-only CMs resulted in significantly lower accumulation compared to serum-free controls (Figure 6). Due to the association of fibrillar FN with the mesenchymal phenotype, it is unsurprising that HLFs conditioned with media from epithelial Ca1a cells experienced diminished FN matrix deposition compared to the control. In addition, although late metastases are characterized by a stiffened ECM, stiffening too early at a metastatic site has been shown to push disseminated cancer cells into a dormant phenotype due to stress signals. Therefore, FN matrix inhibition may be required for disseminated cancer cells to complete MET and form macrometastases. Interestingly, although the FN expression was transient, the lung tissue density remained significantly higher in 15, 20, and 25 d mice as compared to wild-type mice (Figure 1). A growing number of proteins have been shown to depend on FN in order to be incorporated into the ECM, including collagens, fibrillins, and tenascin-C. Of particular note, FN and type I collagen have been co-localized in the secretory pathway of fibroblasts, and collagen fibrils do not accumulate in the absence of FN. An increase in FN fibrils may act as an initial ECM foundation in the premetastatic niche, which is then replaced with an abundance of collagen I. Given the suppression of FN by epithelial BC cells, is it interesting that Ca1a:Ca1h co-cultured CM produced a more robust FN matrix than homogenous Ca1h CM (Figure 6). We have previously highlighted the synergistic dynamic of a heterogenous tumor, demonstrating that a Ca1a:Ca1h co-culture increased metastatic efficiency in vivo and increased survival in nutrient-starved in vitro collagen cultures compared to homogenous cultures. The presence of both fractions likely leads to paracrine signaling that promotes overall EMP for the cell types. In addition, the presence of some post-EMT cells in the primary tumor may act as a spark that initiates FN accumulation as the environment transitions from pro-growth to pro-invasion. These findings also indicate why Ca1h shFN30 CM would produce a robust matrix similar to that of Ca1a:Ca1h CM. Our previous results demonstrated that depleting FN in Ca1h cells led to a mixed phenotype population, where both E-Cadherin and vimentin were expressed. Importantly, conditioning HLFs with EV-enriched solutions to model formation of premetastatic niches via endocrine signaling indicated a different relationship between BC cell phenotype and FN accumulation. Our results suggest that the mesenchymal BC cells in the primary tumor most dramatically influence FN accumulation at metastatic niches (Figure 7), while EMP heterogeneity may facilitate more FN accumulation at the primary tumor (Figure 6). Through the use of noncanonical amino acid labeling we found that the bulk of the matrix accumulation induced by EVs occurs through NSPs by fibroblasts (Figure 8). Although the fibrillar FN associated with EVs is not directly incorporated into the ECM, FN present on the surface of the EVs may influence the rate of delivery to the secondary organ and increase the rate of EV consumption by HLFs. Others have similarly theorized that FN in the premetastatic niche increases the adhesion of exosomes and facilitates the colonization of circulating tumor cells. In addition, modeling premetastatic niche formation using Ca1h EVs resulted in normal aligned FN matrices (Figure 7). In contrast, all of the BC CM groups resulted in matrix formation where the FN fibrils were no longer highly aligned. They instead clustered into pockets of FN, which then potentially interconnected in a more webbed pattern (Figure 6). This aberrant architecture matches what has been reported in the literature at the primary tumor. Specifically, this radial fibril orientation is associated with primary tumor invasion and is not seen in metastatic niches. Furthermore, previous research has associated several adhesion molecules on cancer-associated fibroblasts, including syndecan-1 and DDR2, with the regulation of matrix organization and stiffness in BC and should be investigated on the HLFs conditioned via CM or EV-enriched solutions. Future studies will focus on an in-depth analysis of the HLFs after BC CM and EV conditioning.Overall, we demonstrated through immunoblotting and fluorescent staining that BC cells themselves were not readily capable of completing the cell-mediated process of FN matrix deposition. Because the Ca1a:Ca1h CM and Ca1h shFN30 CM samples contained vastly different concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 and FN, there are clearly additional soluble factors that influence FN matrix accumulation and architecture in primary tumor niches. One such factor may be TG2, which was shown in our previous work to be upregulated in cells with EMP and here to promote FN matrix formation from healthy mammary cells. Previous literature has also highlighted lysyl oxidase (LOX) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as potential proteins of interest, which were beyond the scope of this work. We note that the CM was collected from BC cultures without matrix or other cell types present. It is also likely that incorporating these would alter the factors released by the BC cells. For example, if Ca1a cells were directly seeded onto HLF cultures after FN matrix formation, an increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) release may occur and result in matrix breakdown, which was not seen here. While this work focused on FN accumulation directly from or due to BC cells, there is growing evidence that the stromal cells of the primary tumor microenvironment, such as transitioned cancer-associated fibroblasts, also have a substantial role in premetastatic niche formation. The work presented here can be further expanded through detailed co-culturing of phenotypically static or plastic BC cells with tumor-associated stromal cells and analysis of the resulting matrices. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. In Vivo AssaysAll in vivo assays were conducted under IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) approval from the PACUC (Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee), protocol 1310000978A010. Luciferase expressing 4T1 cells were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (50 \u00b5L) and orthotopically engrafted onto the second mammary fat pad of 4 week old Balb/c mice (2.5 \u00d7 104 cells/mouse) (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Primary tumor growth and metastasis development were assessed via weekly bioluminescent imaging using the Advanced Molecular Imager (AMI) (Spectral Instruments, Tucson, AZ, USA). Based on previously established variability for bioluminescent imaging, 3 mice per group was chosen to adequately power our experiments to 0.80, with an \u03b1 of 0.05. Mice were euthanized via CO2 inhalation and the lungs and primary tumors were immediately extracted and placed in 10% formalin for 24 h. One lobe of each lung and half of each primary tumor was then dehydrated in 70% ethanol. Following histological sectioning, 5 \u00b5m sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin for visualization of tissue density and formation of pulmonary metastatic nodules.Immunohistochemical analyses of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections from 4T1 pulmonary tumors were conducted by deparaffinization in xylene, rehydration, and antigen retrieval using 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) under pressurized boiling. After inactivation of endogenous peroxidases in 3% H2O2, primary antibodies specific to Ki-67 (BD biosciences, Cat#556003, 1:100 dilution) or FN (BD biosciences, Cat#610077, 1:1000 dilution) were added to serial sections and incubated overnight. Protein-specific staining was detected through the use of appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies in conjunction with ABC reagent (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA). These sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. 4.2. Tissue ClearingAfter fixation in 10% formalin, one lobe of each lung and half of each primary tumor underwent tissue clearing following the X-CLARITY Systems protocol (Logos Biosystems, Annandale, VA, USA). Briefly, samples were submerged for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C in hydrogel initiator solution (1 part 25% (w/v) X-CLARITY Polymerization Initiator with 100 parts X-CLARITY Hydrogel Solution) (Cat#C1310X). Samples were then polymerized with the X-CLARITY Polymerization System at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h at 90 kPa and rinsed with PBS. Samples were put in the X-CLARITY Tissue Clearing System II and submerged with X-CLARITY Electrophoretic Tissue Clearing Solution (Cat#C13001) at 1.2A, 37 \u00b0C, with a pump rate of 60 rpm, until clear (approximately 16\u201318 h, but tissue-size dependent). Cleared samples were immunolabeled using the c-PRESTO (centrifugal pressure related efficient and stable transfer of macromolecules into organs) technique. Briefly, samples were blocked with 6% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% TritonX-100 for 24 h and stained with FN (Sigma, Cat#3648) for 2 h at 4000 rpm and DAPI. Samples are placed in X-CLARITY mounting solution (Cat#C13101) for 1\u20132 h before imaging. 4.3. ReagentsCa1a and Ca1h cells were kindly provided by Dr. Fred Miller (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA). MCF10A-HER2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Julio Aguirre-Ghiso (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA). The murine metastatic 4T1 cells were constructed to stably express firefly luciferase via transfection under Zeocin selection. The HME2, Post TGF-\u03b2, LAPR, and the BM series of cells were previously established and described. The majority of cell lines were cultured in DMEM/High Glucose media with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The HER2+ BC cell lines (HMLE E2, HMLE Post TGF-\u03b2, LAPR, BM, BM Lym Mets, BMNR, and BMAR) were additionally cultured with 1% insulin. The HLFs were cultured in DMEM/High Glucose media with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin or in fibroblast low-serum growth media (ATCC). All serum-free media was the standard media used without the fetal bovine serum.4.4. Generation of HLF shFN30/32 Cell LinePrimary human pulmonary fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC and cultured in the recommended fibroblast basal media supplemented with fibroblast growth factor low serum kit (ATCC). Depletion of FN was achieved through lentiviral-mediated transduction of TRCN0000064830, TRCN0000064832, or a nontargeting, scrambled control shRNA, and stable expression was selected for using puromycin (GE Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA). 4.5. Generation of HMLE-TGM2 Cell LineHMLE cells were kindly provided by Sendurai Mani (MD Anderson Cancer Center). These cells were cultured in HMLE media as previously described. Overexpression of TG2 was achieved through lentiviral-mediated transduction of pLV (VectorBuilder, Santa Clara, CA, USA) encoding full length human TGM2 or GFP as a control. Stable genomic integration of constructs was selected for using puromycin. HMLE-TGM2 cells were cultured in full growth media for 6 weeks, which resulted in the mesenchymal HMLE-TGM2 cell line utilized for the studies. 4.6. Generation of HME2-BMNR and HME2-BMAR Cell LinesHME2-BM cells were treated with 100 nM neratinib or afatinib for 8 weeks to obtain HME2-BM neratinib-resistant and HME2-BM afatinib-resistant cell lines (HME2-BMNR and HME2-BMAR).4.7. DecellularizationCells in chamber slides or 6 well plates were decellularized before immunoblotting or immunostaining for FN (Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA, Cat#3648, 1:200 dilution) when indicated as previously described. Starting with live cells, cells were washed with PBS then deionized water. The samples were immersed in a 0.1% TX100 with 1.5 M KCL in 50 mM Tris buffer solution at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h on a slow-moving shaker. Samples were washed in 10 mM Tris buffer and then deionized water for 1 h each on a slow-moving shaker. 4.8. Fluorescent ImagingFor immunofluorescence, plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with polyclonal FN antibody (Sigma, Cat#3648, 1:200 dilution). If not decellularized, cells were also stained with DAPI, but were never permeabilized during staining. In studies involving labeling with Aha, cells were cultured for two days in glutamine-, methionine- and cystine-free high-glucose DMEM (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 1% glutagro (Corning, Corning, NY, USA), 0.2\u2009mM cystine (Sigma), and 40 \u00b5g/mL of either Aha (Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) or Met (Sigma) as a control. For nascent protein visualization, cells were incubated in fresh media without Aha or methionine, but with 30\u2009\u03bcM Alexa Fluor DBCO-647 (Click Chemistry Tools) for 30 min at 37 \u2009\u00b0C. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. 4.9. Immunoblot AnalysisFor immunoblot analyses, cells were lysed using a modified RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1.0% NP40, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 mM activated sodium ortho-vanadate, 40 mM \u03b2-glycerolphosphate, and 20 mM sodium fluoride. These lysates were separated by reducing SDS PAGE and probed for FN (BD biosciences, Cat#610077, 1:250 dilution) or \u03b2-tubulin (DSHB, Iowa City, IA, USA, Cat#E7). Where indicated, cellular monolayers were removed through incubation with 0.4% triton, 1.5 NaCl, 50 mM, Tris pH 8, and 50 mM EDTA for 48 h in 4 \u00b0C, washed with water, incubated with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate at 25 \u00b0C, and finally incubated with PBS (+MgCl2) for 1 h. Secreted proteins were precipitated from serum-free media by incubating 6 volumes of sample with 1 volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid and 1 volume of 0.1% sodium deoxycholate on ice for 30 min. Protein was precipitated via centrifugation and the pellet was twice washed with acetone and finally boiled at 95 \u00b0C with 500 \u00b5L of 4\u00d7 laemmli buffer, separated by reducing SDS PAGE, and probed for FN (BD biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, Cat#610077, 1:250 dilution). 4.10. Conditioned Media AssaysTo generate the conditioned media, cells were seeded at a density of 6 \u00d7 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate (Corning Cell Culture plate). After 24 h, with the cells at around 80% confluent, the medium was switched to serum-free media (DMEM/High Glucose with 1% penicillin/streptomycin). After 30 h, the media was collected, filtered using a 0.2 um filter, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. After media collection, the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and counted. Then, 50,000 HLFs were cultured in each well of a 4-well chamber slide in serum-free media or in the media collected from the BC cultures for 48 h. The amount of CM used was normalized to the same number of BC cells per condition. To assess the amount of FN found in the conditioned media samples, an ELISA was performed (Human Fibronectin ELISA kit; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). A filtered aliquot was thawed and used as the sample. The FN standard was reconstituted with the appropriate buffer, however, standards were made using serum-free media (DMEM/High Glucose with 1% penicillin/streptomycin) to better represent the sample conditions. The assay was performed following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To evaluate the TGF-\u03b21 content in the conditioned media samples, an ELISA was performed (TGF-\u03b21 Human ELISA kit; Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were not diluted 1:10 with Assay Buffer as stated in the protocol. Instead, 200 \u00b5l of thawed conditioned media was used. The assay was then performed following the protocol provided by the manufacturer.The cell pellet was resuspended in Pierce RIPA buffer (1 mL per 5 \u00d7 106 cells) (Thermo Scientific) and placed on a shaker on ice for 30 min. These samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use. The lysed cell samples were thawed and spun down at 14,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for the BCA assay, in accordance with the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).4.11. Extracellular Vesicles AssaysEVs were enriched from BC CM as previously described from 2 T175, 5-layer flasks (Corning Cat#353144) after 72 h serum-free conditioning (~2 \u00d7 108 BC cells per type). Briefly, CM samples underwent serial centrifugation from 300 to 2000\u00d7 g, 0.22-\u00b5Mpore size filtration, 3-KDa molecular weight cut-off concentration, and ultracentrifugation at 100,000 \u00d7 g. Pellets were additionally washed with PBS using ultracentrifugation. Pelleted EVs were resuspended in PBS and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. A portion of the solution was used for a BCA assay, using dilutions from 1:100\u20131:10,000 in a RIPA/PBS mixture, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit; Thermo Scientific). Then, 50,000 HLFs were cultured in each well of a 4-well chamber slide in serum-free media. Each well was given 5 \u00b5g total protein of EV solution from one BC cell type and fixed after 48 h.4.12. Statistical AnalysesTwo-sided T tests were used where the data met the assumptions of these tests and the variance was similar between the two groups being compared. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. No exclusion criteria were utilized in these studies. All data are reported as the mean and sample standard deviation. 5. ConclusionsAnalysis of BC patient data has correlated FN matrix accumulation with the poorest survival outcomes irrespective of subtype. Accumulation of FN has also been reported to predict where macrometastases will form and has been traced to resident stromal origins and primary tumor origins. In this work, we have indicated that BC cells cannot produce a mature FN matrix regardless of subtype, EMT status, metastatic potential, or acquired chemotherapeutic resistance. We further demonstrated that FN production, release, and matrix organization involves separate mechanisms in both BC and fibroblast cells. Resident fibroblasts will incorporate both exogenous and endogenous soluble FN into a complete matrix and are heavily influenced by the soluble factors released by BC cells. Homogeneous epithelial BC cultures inhibit HLF FN matrix organization, while homogenous mesenchymal BC cultures do not. However, cultures with EMP characteristics, such as Ca1a:Ca1h co-cultures and Ca1h shFN30 cultures result in the most robust matrices from HLF cells, which is not directly correlated with the amount of soluble FN or TGF-\u03b21 in the media. Lastly, endocrine conditioning of fibroblasts via BC EVs in early metastatic niche development seems dependent on a stable mesenchymal phenotype, which resulted in a significantly greater FN matrix. Despite this, the FN in and on the extracellular vesicles did not directly contribute to this matrix accumulation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated site-dependent and phenotype-dependent fibroblast conditioning, resulting in varied FN matrix accumulation as it relates to tumor microenvironment changes throughout primary tumor development, invasion, and macrometastasis.

It is well established that tumour stroma plays critical roles in controlling breast cancer epithelial cell behaviour, and therefore in defining cancer outcomes. Tumour stroma includes fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, adipocytes, and blood and lymph vessels, but the fibroblasts are typically most abundant and have consequently attracted most attention. Gene expression profiles of these carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) differ substantially from their normal tissue counterparts, although considerable heterogeneity is evident within CAF populations. Studies have identified specific molecules, such as transforming growth factor \u03b2, hepatocyte growth factor, stromal cell-derived factor-1 and phosphatase and tensin homologue, that are expressed by CAFs and regulate carcinoma cell behaviour, typically leading to enhanced tumourigenicity. Studies have also identified gene regulatory events that are responsible for the deregulation of such molecules in CAFs, including changes in promoter methylation, the activity of key transcription factors, and even\u2014controversially\u2014somatic mutations in critical signalling molecules. However, the contributions of microRNAs (miRNAs) to gene deregulation in CAFs are virtually unknown.MiRNAs are a class of more than 1000 non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of up to 60% of genes. They act by binding to mRNAs, usually within 3\u2032 untranslated regions, causing post-transcriptional down-regulation of protein expression by translational repression and/or mRNA destabilization. Many studies have demonstrated deregulation of specific miRNAs in breast cancer and the potential functional consequences within epithelial cancer cells. Thus, specific miRNAs can themselves be regarded as \u2018tumour suppressors\u2019 or \u2018oncogenes\u2019. Examples include miR-10a, miR-373, and miR-21, which act as regulators of growth, invasion, and metastasis. Interestingly, there is some evidence that miR-21, which is up-regulated in breast cancers and was assumed to be functional within epithelial cells, is in fact predominantly expressed in fibroblasts. Very recently, attention has been given to miRNA roles in the fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, with the first report profiling miRNA expression differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs). We examined these differences in great detail and investigated the functional impacts on CAFs of the most consistently deregulated miRNA that we identified, miR-26b.Materials and methodsEthics, tissue, and laser micro-dissection (LMD)Ethical approval was obtained (Leeds East REC 06/Q1206/180). LMD was performed using a Zeiss/PALM Microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) from formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded tissue as described in the Supplementary materials and methods. CAFs were defined as fibroblasts present within tumour masses (as in refs 21 and 22), and less than 2\u2009mm from tumour cells, while NFs were defined by their association with normal epithelium more than 1\u2009cm outside tumour masses. Areas selected were devoid of visible cells other than target cell types. SMA staining [mouse monoclonal; M851 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), 1 : 1000] was performed using an IntelliPATH automated stainer (Menarini, Florence, Italy) and the manufacturer's standard conditions.Tissue culture, transfection, transduction, and functional assaysMCF7 and HB2 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Stable GFP expression was conferred by pTH-GFPa, a selectable GFP expression vector. MCF7 cells that stably express firefly luciferase were obtained from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA, USA; #AKR-234). Primary fibroblasts were isolated from breast surgical samples and immortalized by hTERT retroviral transduction as described previously. Reverse transfection of pre-/anti-miR (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and/or plasmids was performed using HiPerFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Stable miR-26b/control \u2018knock-down\u2019 was performed using pmiRZIP lentiviral vectors (System Biosciences, Mountain View, USA). Assays for cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were performed as described previously. Flow-cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were performed on LSRII (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and MoFlo (Dako) machines, respectively. Spheroid invasion assays were carried out using modifications of a previously described method. Spheroids were formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded, and 5\u2009\u00b5m sections stained with haematoxylin/eosin, or treated for immunohistochemistry (rabbit anti-cytokeratin, Ab9377; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; see ref 28) as above. Dual luciferase assays and pmiRGLO reporter were used (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). Details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.RNA extraction, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and microarray analysesRecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation for FFPE (Ambion) was used for RNA extraction from FFPE. MirVana miRNA Isolation (Ambion) and RNeasy (Qiagen) were used for extraction from cell lines of miRNA and mRNA, respectively. qPCR analyses were performed on 7500/7900HT machines in triplicate with Taqman assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Microarray analyses of miRNA expression were performed using human miRNA v2 arrays and system v1.7 reagents (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Further details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.Protein mass spectrometryPeptides from processed lysates of cell pellets were separated by capillary liquid chromatography (LC) and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using the RSLCnano system and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The data search against the IPI Human 3.87 database and label-free quantitation (LFQ) were performed using MaxQuant 1.2.2.5. Further details may be found in the Supplementary materials and methods.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA) with two-tailed tests described in the text. Mass spectrometry data were analysed using R (OSX v2.15.1); expression levels were log2 median-normalized and analysed using t-tests, and p values converted to false discovery rates using Benjamini\u2013Hochberg methodology.ResultsMiRNA expression in breast NFs differs from that in CAFsWe compared the miRNA profiles of breast NFs with those of CAFs using two sources of cells: (i) fibroblasts isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using laser micro-dissection (LMD); and (ii) a tissue culture model in which breast fibroblasts were combined with either non-transformed breast epithelial cells or breast cancer epithelial cells.To validate our LMD protocols, we first prepared samples enriched for either epithelial cells or stromal fibroblasts from tissue blocks of a single breast cancer case [luminal A subtype, (ER+/her2\u2212)] and from matched normal breast tissue. Figure 1A shows representative LMD sections; fibroblast-enriched samples are referred to as fibroblast-enriched stroma (F). Tumour sections were stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA), demonstrating that the majority of CAFs were SMA-positive (Figure 1B). MiRNAs were extracted from LMD samples and microarrays were used to determine expression profiles. Of the 723 miRNAs analysed, 229 (32%) were detected in at least one sample. Many miRNAs were detected in fibroblast-enriched stroma that were not detected in epithelial cells from the same tissue (normal tissue: 86; cancer tissue: 68; Figure 1B), demonstrating that LMD had successfully allowed enrichment for separate cell populations and that the fibroblast-enriched stroma and epithelial miRNA profiles differed. Very few epithelial-specific miRNAs were identified (normal tissue: 3; cancer tissue: 7; Figure 1B). We then examined differential expression between normal and cancer as determined in fibroblast-enriched stroma or epithelial samples (Figure 1C). Seventy-six and 26 miRNAs were found to be down- or up-regulated, respectively, in both epithelium and fibroblast-enriched stroma, indicating some commonality between miRNA deregulation in these breast cancer compartments. A large number of miRNAs were found to be deregulated solely within fibroblast-enriched stroma (77 down; 82 up), while epithelial cell-specific deregulation was relatively rare (14 down; 16 up).Laser micro-dissection (LMD) allowed analysis of miRNA deregulation in the fibroblast and epithelial cell compartments of breast cancers. (A) Representative images of breast cancer tissue before (left) and after (right) LMD of fibroblast-enriched stroma or epithelial cells as labelled. FFPE breast tissue was sectioned and stained with toluidine blue. Regions for LMD were identified based on morphology. (B) Representative images of tumour sections stained for smooth muscle actin (SMA) using immunohistochemistry. (C, D) Total RNA was extracted from at least 5\u2009mm2 of LMD tissue enriched for fibroblasts or epithelial cells from breast cancer tissue or from matched normal breast tissue. Microarray analyses of miRNA expression were performed. (C) Numbers of miRNAs detected in only samples of fibroblast-enriched stroma (F), in both samples of fibroblast-enriched stroma and epithelial cells (F and E), or in only epithelial cell samples (E) are shown for each tissue. (D) Relative expression of each miRNA was compared between normal and cancer tissue within fibroblast-enriched stroma (F) or within epithelial cells (E). Numbers of individual miRNAs that were up- or down-regulated in those compartments are displayed in Venn diagrams showing how many were deregulated in common between compartments (the intersects), or were deregulated in one compartment only.MiRNA expression was also examined in a tissue culture model. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were co-cultured with either HB2 cells, breast epithelial cells of non-cancer origin considered to represent normal epithelium, or MCF7 cells, representative of epithelial cells of the most common breast cancer subtype (luminal A). Epithelial cell lines were stably labelled with GFP in order to allow their separate analysis within co-cultures. Fibroblasts had a potent and differential effect on the growth of the two epithelial cell types; the growth of MCF7 cancer cells was stimulated more than five-fold by fibroblasts, while the growth of HB2 cells was not altered (Figure 2). Thus, fibroblasts within the fibroblast/MCF7 co-culture behaved in a manner analogous to CAFs, while those within the fibroblast/HB2 co-culture exhibited less functional cross-talk. Fibroblasts were co-cultured with HB2 or MCF7 cells for 9\u2009days before being isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. MiRNA expression within these fibroblasts was examined using microarrays. Two hundred and twenty-six (31%) of the 723 miRNAs analysed were detected in at least one sample. One hundred and sixty-six miRNAs were expressed at lower levels, and 60 miRNAs were more highly expressed in the fibroblasts when they were cultured with MCF7 cancer cells (the CAF model), compared with those cultured with benign HB2 cells (the NF model).Growth of MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells, but not non-transformed \u2018normal\u2019 HB2 breast epithelial cells, was stimulated by immortalized breast fibroblasts. GFP-labelled MCF7 breast cancer cells (A) or HB2 benign breast epithelial cells (B) were co-cultured with immortalized breast fibroblasts (pictured), or were cultured alone, and epithelial cell growth was monitored by counting GFP-positive cells using flow cytometry for up to 10\u2009days. Data are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments.Next, we identified miRNAs that were consistently differentially expressed both between NFs and CAFs from clinical samples and between the tissue culture model \u2018NFs\u2019 and \u2018CAFs\u2019 (complete dataset\u2014Supplementary Data 1). One hundred and four miRNAs were down-regulated and ten miRNAs were up-regulated in CAFs in both assays (see Supplementary Data 2), representing a remarkably high degree of overlap (eg 69% of LMD-identified down-regulations were also seen in tissue culture, while 63% of tissue culture-identified down-regulations were also seen using LMD). Candidate miRNAs were further filtered using a cut-off of fold changes greater than 10 in both assays, which left six miRNAs that showed consistent and substantial down-regulation (Table1).Six miRNAs are consistently down-regulated more than ten-fold in breast CAFs compared with breast NFs in both tissues (comparing matched NF-enriched stroma and CAF-enriched stroma prepared by LMD; Figure 1) and a co-culture model [comparing immortalized breast fibroblasts co-cultured either with the benign breast epithelial cell line HB2 (representing NFs) or with the breast carcinoma cell line MCF7 (representing CAFs); Figure 2]. \u2018GeoMean fold change\u2019 is the Geomean of the fold change in tissues and in the co-culture modelMiRNA\tRegulation\tFold change (tissues)\tFold change (co-culture)\tGeoMean fold change\t \tMiR-7f\tDown\t47.6\t10.2\t22\t \tLet-7\u2009g\tDown\t15\t11.4\t13\t \tMiR-107\tDown\t13.1\t11.5\t12.3\t \tMiR-15b\tDown\t14.2\t10.8\t12.4\t \tMiR-26b\tDown\t21\t49.3\t32.2\t \tMiR-30b\tDown\t12.3\t30.2\t19.3\t \tMiR-26b is down-regulated in breast cancer CAFsMiR-26b was examined further as it showed the greatest mean fold change (Table1). Further samples enriched for NFs or CAFs were prepared by LMD from archival tissue blocks representing an additional 14 sequential cases of luminal A subtype breast cancers (defined as ER+/her2\u2212). MiR-26b expression was quantified using qPCR (Figure 3A). MiR-26b was down-regulated in CAF-enriched stroma compared with NF-enriched stroma in 11/14 cases (Figure 3A; Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank p\u2009=\u20090.04). We also examined miR-26b expression in matched primary cultures of NFs and CAFs isolated from four more breast cancer cases; miR-26b was down-regulated in CAFs in all cases (Figure 3B). Therefore, we found miR-26b to be down-regulated in CAFs in 15/18 cases in our validation cohort. Supplementary Table 1 shows the clinical features of this cohort.MiR-26b expression was frequently down-regulated in CAFs compared with matched NFs. (A) Samples enriched for fibroblasts were isolated by LMD from samples of matched breast cancer and normal tissue from 14 sequential cases of luminal A breast cancer (see Supplementary Table 1). (B) Primary cultures of matched NFs and CAFs were established from four further breast cancer cases. qPCR was used to analyse miR-26b expression relative to the geometric mean RNU6B and RNU48. Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error).Reduced miR-26b activity in fibroblasts inhibits growth but enhances migration and invasionWe examined whether manipulation of miR-26b levels resulted in changes in fibroblast behaviour. Firstly, we transiently transfected immortalized breast fibroblasts with anti-miR-26b or control molecules. We used qPCR to assess the degrees of miR-26b knock-down in these transfections. MiR-26b expression was reduced by more than three-fold (Figure 4A; p\u2009=\u20090.03), although it is worth noting that this may under-represent the reduction in miR-26b function since some miR-26b molecules detected may have been functionally sequestered in the cells by anti-miR-26b molecules. Transient knock-down of miR-26b caused a small but statistically significant reduction in fibroblast growth (Figure 4B; p\u2009=\u20090.02 at 48\u2009h). We also measured the migration of anti-miR-26b or control transfected fibroblasts using trans-well assays. Migration was significantly increased by more than three-fold by anti-miR-26b transfection (Figure 4C; p\u2009=\u20090.008). We also investigated the consequences of miR-26b overexpression by transiently transfecting fibroblasts with pre-miR-26b or control molecules. MiR-26b overexpression caused dramatic and rapid cell death (Supplementary Figure 1), as has been observed previously in colorectal cancer cells. However, qPCR analyses revealed that miR-26b was overexpressed by more than 1000-fold in these transfections (Supplementary Figure 1C). We believe that this lacks clinical relevance since this degree of overexpression greatly exceeded differential miR-26b expression in matched NFs and CAFs (Figure 3); therefore, we did not proceed with further overexpression studies.Transient miR-26b down-regulation in breast fibroblasts inhibited growth but stimulated migration. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were transiently transfected with anti-miR-26b molecules or with control anti-miRs. (A) MiR-26b expression was quantified 24\u2009h after transfection using qPCR (relative to RNU6B). Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments. (B) Cell growth was monitored by MTT assays over 72\u2009h. (C) Migration of fibroblasts was assessed 24\u2009h after transfection using trans-well migration assays by manual counting of cells that had passed through the membranes. Data in B and C are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments.To study the consequences of reduced miR-26b function, we stably knocked down miR-26b in breast fibroblasts using lentiviral vectors (which also conferred GFP expression). Fibroblasts were stably transduced to reduce miR-26b function (designated \u201826bk/d\u2019), or were transduced with control virus (designated \u2018controlk/d\u2019), and flow cytometry was used to enrich populations to maintain more than 90% transduced cells (GFP-positive). A two-fold reduction in miR-26b expression was observed by qPCR (Figure 5A; p\u2009=\u20090.02). As before, we were conscious that this might not accurately reflect functional knock-down; we therefore also performed luciferase reporter assays to assess miR-26b function. A single, fully complementary miR-26b binding site was cloned downstream of the luciferase reading frame in a reporter, and 26bk/d or controlk/d cells were transfected with the reporter. Luciferase assays demonstrated that 26bk/d cells allowed two-fold higher expression of a miR-26b target (Figure 5B; p\u2009=\u20090.001), indicative of reduced miR-26b function. We also examined the influences of miR-26b knock-down on cell growth/viability by both monitoring the growth of 26bk/d and controlk/d cells (Figure 5C) and examining their cell cycle distributions (Figure 5D). In accordance with our previous findings (Figure 4A), we found that 26bk/d cells grew slightly more slowly than controlk/d cells (p\u2009=\u20090.01 at 72\u2009h). This appeared to relate to a cell cycle defect represented by an increase in cells in the G2/M phase (Figure 5D; p\u2009=\u20090.02). However, these growth and cell cycle defects are minor and may lack biological relevance. Next, we examined the migratory or invasive capacities of 26bk/d and controlk/d cells using scratch-closure and trans-well migration assays, or trans-well Matrigel invasion assays. 26bk/d cells showed increased migration in scratch-closure assays, although this fell just short of statistical significance (Figure 5E; p\u2009=\u20090.06). However, 26bk/d cells demonstrated significantly enhanced migration and invasion in trans-well assays (Figure 5F, p\u2009=\u20090.001; Figure 5G, p\u2009=\u20090.03). A second independent immortalized breast fibroblast line was also transduced to knock down miR-26b (designated \u201826bk/d2\u2019) or was control transduced (designated \u2018controlk/d2\u2019); this also demonstrated significantly enhanced migration and invasion after miR-26b knock-down (Figure 5F, p\u2009=\u20090.02; Figure 5G, p\u2009=\u20090.02). We concluded that breast fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b, as seen in CAFs, exhibited reduced growth but increased motility and invasive capabilities.Stable down-regulation of miR-26b in breast fibroblasts inhibited growth but stimulated both migration and invasion. Immortalized breast fibroblasts were stably transduced to knock down miR-26b (26k/d) or with a control construct (conk/d). (A) MiR-26b expression was quantified in the two cell lines using qPCR (relative to RNU6B). Data are means of technical triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate experiments. (B) MiR-26b function was assessed as ratios of firefly to Renilla luciferase expression using a miR-26b target luciferase reporter (containing a perfect miR-26b binding site downstream of firefly luciferase and also coding for Renilla luciferase as an internal control). Cell lines were transfected with the reporter and dual luciferase assays were performed after 24\u2009h. (C) Cell growth in the two cell lines was monitored using MTT assays over 72\u2009h after initial seeding of equal numbers of cells. (D) Proportions of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined in sub-confluent cultures using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. (E) Migration was determined in scratch-closure assays using digital imaging as the percentage scratch area remaining 18\u2009h after scratch formation. Representative images are shown immediately after forming the scratch and at 18\u2009h. (F) Migration was determined in trans-well assays by manual counting of cells that had passed through the membrane. A representative example of the trans-well migration result is shown. A second independent breast fibroblast line was also stably transduced (26k/d2 and conk/d2). Cells having migrated through the membranes were counted at 12\u2009h for 26k/d and conk/d and at 24\u2009h for 26k/d2 and conk/d2 (the second pair of transduced fibroblast lines migrated/invaded more slowly, reflecting variation between individual parental fibroblasts). (G) Invasion was assessed using trans-well assays by manual counting (at the same time points as F). Data in B\u2013G are means of biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate (B, D\u2013G) or triplicate (C) experiments.Reduced miR-26b activity in fibroblasts enhances migration/invasion of epithelial cancer cellsWe were especially interested to determine whether miR-26b in breast fibroblasts could modify epithelial cancer cell behaviour. We co-cultured either 26bk/d or controlk/d fibroblasts with MCF7 epithelial cancer cells. We used MCF7 cells that stably express luciferase in order to quantify them separately within co-cultures. As expected, the presence of fibroblasts enhanced MCF7 growth (see Figure 2), but 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts did not have differential influences (Figure 6A). This experiment was performed seeding epithelial cells and fibroblasts at a ratio of 1 : 3 in accordance with published literature; differential influences of 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts on epithelial growth were also not seen at other ratios (Supplementary Figure 2). Next, migration and invasion assays were performed with MCF7/fibroblast co-cultures (seeding ratios of 1 : 3). In trans-well assays, MCF7 cells demonstrated significantly enhanced migration in the presence of 26bk/d fibroblasts (Figure 6B; p\u2009=\u20090.008), although a trend for enhanced invasion fell short of statistical significance (Figure 6C). This enhanced migration of MCF7 cells was not reproduced when the fibroblasts were seeded separately in the lower chambers of the trans-wells (Supplementary Figure 3). Invasion assays were also performed using three-dimensional spheroids, which better reflect in vivo interactions between cells and the microenvironment. MCF7 cells were aggregated with 26bk/d or controlk/d fibroblasts, or with each of the second pair of transduced fibroblasts, 26bk/d2 or controlk/d2, before being encased in collagen-I/Matrigel matrix and incubated for up to 48\u2009h. Invasion into the matrix of large groups of cells was dramatically enhanced by the 26bk/d fibroblasts (Figure 6D; p\u2009=\u20090.01) compared with controls; indeed, these outgrowths were absent in the presence of one control line. These striking outgrowths were characterized in more detail by staining with haematoxylin and eosin (Figure 6E) or for epithelial cytokeratins (Figure 6F). Outgrowths contained predominantly epithelial cells (based on morphology and positive cytokeratin expression; labelled \u2018e\u2019) with some internal fibroblasts (based on morphology and/or negative cytokeratin expression; labelled \u2018f1\u2019). Fibroblasts were mainly visible on the external surface of outgrowths (labelled \u2018f2\u2019) and radiating through the matrix from the spheroid (labelled \u2018f3\u2019).MCF7 cell migration and invasion are stimulated by breast fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b. MCF7 cells (luciferase-positive) were co-cultured with miR-26b knock-down (26k/d) or with control (conk/d) breast fibroblasts (seeding ratio of one epithelial cell to three fibroblasts). (A) MCF7 cell growth was monitored within co-cultures using luciferase assays over 72\u2009h (entire co-cultures were lysed and luciferase activity, present within the epithelial cells only, was quantified). (B, C) Migration or invasion of MCF7 cells within co-cultures was assessed 24\u2009h after seeding in trans-well assays using luciferase assays (cells having passed through the membrane were lysed and luciferase activity was quantified within the lysates). (D) MCF7 cells and fibroblasts were aggregated, forming three-dimensional spheroids, and were suspended in a collagen-I/Matrigel matrix for up to 48\u2009h. Invasion of MCF7 cells away from the central spheroid was quantified as shown at 48\u2009h. Assays were performed with 26k/d or conk/d fibroblasts and with equivalent lines derived from an independent breast fibroblast line (line 2). (E, F) Spheroids were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were taken and stained using haematoxylin and eosin (E) or for epithelial cytokeratins (F). Scale bars (top right of each image)\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u00b5m. Epithelial cells (cobblestone morphology/cytokeratin-positive) are labelled \u2018e\u2019, while populations of fibroblasts (elongated morphology/cytokeratin-negative) are labelled \u2018f1\u2019 (internal to spheroid outgrowth), \u2018f2\u2019 (surface of outgrowth), and \u2018f3\u2019 (within matrix radiating from spheroid). Data are means of at least biological triplicates (\u00b1 standard error) and are representative of duplicate (B\u2013D) or triplicate (A) experiments.MiR-26b regulates multiple molecular pathways in breast fibroblastsOur next aim was to determine the molecular pathways responsible for the altered behaviour of 26bk/d fibroblasts. Initially, we identified potential direct miR-26b targets using bioinformatics (TargetScan; http://www.targetscan.org); these predictions suggested that miR-26b might target more than 100 different transcripts. In order to identify pathways altered in breast fibroblasts, we carried out proteomic comparisons of 26bk/d and controlk/d fibroblasts. Label-free protein mass spectrometry was performed on triplicate flasks of both cell types (dataset\u2014Supplementary Data 3). As expected, expressions in the triplicates were highly related, with mean Spearman's rho coefficients for pairwise comparisons between triplicates of 0.83 and 0.85 for 26bk/d and controlk/d cells, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). We identified proteins that were significantly differentially expressed between the lines. Three hundred and sixty proteins (of a total of 3369 detected) were differentially expressed (Student's t-test; p\u2009<\u20090.05). When multiple testing was taken into account using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.1, this was reduced to 11 proteins (Table2). In order to determine molecular pathways that were deregulated in 26bk/d cells, we subjected the protein lists to gene ontology analyses (ToppGene Suite; http://toppgene.cchmc.org/). The list of 360 proteins was significantly enriched for genes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle (nine genes from 35 in the genome; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and in cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases (14 from 72; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Supplementary Table 2). For identification of potential direct miR-26b targets, we limited our analyses to changes in expression identified at an FDR of less than 0.1. We examined whether the 11 differentially expressed proteins were predicted miR-26b targets and whether this correlated with up- or down-regulation; up-regulation in 26bk/d cells was expected for direct miR-26b targets. Five proteins were up-regulated in 26bk/d cells, three of which were predicted targets, while six were down-regulated, none of which were predicted targets (Table2). This distribution of predicted targets supports the conclusion that these three predictions are true direct targets. These are tankyrase 1 binding protein 1 (TNKS1BP1), cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 7 (CPSF7), and collagen type XII alpha 1 (COL12A1). The functional relevance of these three molecules was examined further by mining publicly available data. Expression data are available for 53 breast cancers from which cancer stroma was isolated by LMD and stromal mRNA expression levels were profiled using expression arrays. We tested whether stromal expression of TNKS1BP1, CPSF7 or COL12A1 was associated with differences in time to recurrence. Expression was dichotomized using Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis in order to allow Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses of groups with high and low expression. For each gene, high expression, as seen in 26bk/d cells, was significantly associated with increased rates of recurrence (Figure 7; log rank, TNKS1BP1 p\u2009=\u20090.002, CPSF7 p\u2009=\u20090.007, COL12A1 p\u2009=\u20090.043), implicating them, and by inference miR-26b, as stromal determinants of breast cancer outcome.Proteins differentially expressed between controlk/d and 26k/d fibroblasts (false discovery rate\u2009<\u20090.1). Immortalized breast fibroblasts were virally transduced to reduce expression of miR-26b (26k/d) or were control transduced (controlk/d). Label-free quantitative protein mass spectrometry was performed on triplicate flasks of the two cell lines. Fold changes were calculated using mean expression levels in triplicate controlk/d samples and triplicate 26k/d samplesGene\tRegulation/protein fold change*\tPredicted target\t \tTMEM119\tDown\tNo\t \tNUDCD3\tDown\tNo\t \tTPM2\tDown\tNo\t \tFAM3C\tDown\tNo\t \tCLTB\tDown\tNo\t \tTHOC5\tDown\tNo\t \tUSP19\tUp\tNo\t \tAPIP\tUp\tNo\t \tTNKS1BP1\tUp/3.32\tYes\t \tCPSF7\tUp/4.35\tYes\t \tCOL12A1\tUp/7.20\tYes\t \tFold changes are shown only when the protein was detected in both cell lines\u2013when it was not detected in either line, only the direction of deregulation is indicated.Stromal expression of inferred miR-26b targets predicts breast cancer recurrence. Correlations between high and low (as defined using ROC analyses) stromal expression of TNKS1BP1, CPSF7 or COL12A1 and breast cancer recurrence were tested using Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses, using publicly available mRNA expression array data from laser capture micro-dissected stromal breast cancer tissue from 53 breast cancers, mined using the Oncomine platform (https://www.oncomine.org).DiscussionCAFs are known to differ from NFs in their expression profiles and, consequently, in their behaviour and influences on epithelial cancer cells. However, the molecular basis of these expression differences is poorly understood, with signalling from cancer and other stromal cells, as well as epigenetic deregulation, implicated as key influences. We examined whether miRNA expression differs substantially between NFs and CAFs and whether these differences regulate fibroblast behaviour. We focused on miR-26b, since it was deregulated (down-regulated in CAFs) to the greatest extent in our screens (Table1). Down-regulation of miR-26b has been observed previously in various cancers, including glioma, head/neck/oral cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and breast cancer, and has generally correlated with higher grade or more aggressive cancer types. This conclusion is supported by the fact that low miR-26b expression correlated significantly with poor cancer survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, and in breast cancer in our analysis of publicly available miRNA expression data (Supplementary Figure 4). It should be emphasized that all of these studies analysed expression in cell populations that included both cancer and stromal cells; therefore it is not possible to be certain of the cell type in which miR-26b is expressed and functional. An exception to this is a recent analysis of miRNA expression in six paired primary cultures of NFs and CAFs from breast cancers, in which miR-26b was identified as down-regulated in CAFs, in accordance with our findings, although it is important to note that this study included no assessments of the function or targets of miR-26b.At least 14 different direct targets for miR-26b have been suggested in the literature (see Supplementary Table 3) in a range of other cell types and supported by differing levels of proof. The vast majority of these potential target proteins were not detected in our proteomic analyses, but those that were showed no evidence of significant differential expression between 26bk/d and controlk/d cells. This is compatible with the suggestion that miR-26b targets multiple transcripts and that these vary with cell type. We identified three miR-26b targets in breast fibroblasts and established that their expression in this compartment was significantly associated with survival from breast cancer (Figure 7). These molecules are functionally diverse: TNKS1BP1 is involved in telomere maintenance; CPSF7 regulates polyadenylation; and COL12A1 is an extracellular matrix component. This diversity hints at the potential for miR-26b to have broad-ranging influences on cellular physiology, as has been seen with some other miRNAs. Importantly in this context, we analysed downstream effects of manipulating miR-26b at a wider proteome level. We identified two significantly deregulated pathways: glycolysis/TCA cycle; and cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases. For glycolysis/TCA, all genes were up-regulated in 26bk/d fibroblasts and they included enzymes that catalyse five of the nine main steps of glycolysis. Similar up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes has recently been reported in bladder cancer stroma. These observations are potentially compatible with the \u2018reverse Warburg effect\u2019, as described by Lisanti and co-workers, in which CAFs carry out aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate and pyruvate that are used, in part, by neighbouring cancer cells. However, published work suggests that this results in enhanced cancer cell growth, which we did not find (Figure 6A), rather than the enhanced cancer cell migration/invasion that we saw (Figures 6B\u20136F). With respect to the second pathway, the influences of Rho GTPases on cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility are well established. Notably, Rho signalling has been implicated in CAF-mediated remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, leading to enhanced invasion of cancer cells, a model discussed further below.We have shown that reduced miR-26b can enhance breast fibroblast migration and invasion (Figures 4 and 5) and that this, in turn, can stimulate migration and invasion of epithelial cancer cells in the context of epithelial/fibroblast co-cultures (Figure 6). At least two models have been proposed to explain this stromal\u2013epithelial cross-talk. Firstly, fibroblasts secrete soluble paracrine factors that stimulate epithelial migration/invasion directly. Secondly, fibroblasts modify the structural microenvironment, making it more permissive for epithelial migration/invasion. From our data, we believe that a soluble paracrine factor that acts directly on the epithelial cells is less likely, since we were unable to recapitulate the influence of 26bk/d fibroblasts on epithelial cells when the cells were physically separated in culture (Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore, our preferred model is one that involves modification of the structural microenvironment. Potentially, enhanced epithelial invasion could be a passive phenomenon where epithelial invasion occurs simply by following the passage of fibroblasts through the matrix, making use of the \u2018holes\u2019 that remain behind the fibroblasts; in this case, fibroblasts would be simply removing the barrier of the matrix that inhibits epithelial movement. However, our data indicate that the fibroblasts' influence is more complex. 26bk/d fibroblasts significantly stimulated the migration of epithelial cells in trans-wells lacking matrix, where there was no barrier for the fibroblasts to remove and no matrix in which fibroblasts could leave these \u2018holes\u2019 (Figure 6B). In addition, controlk/d fibroblasts invaded from spheroids, albeit to a lesser degree than 26bk/d fibroblasts, presumably leaving the \u2018holes\u2019 in the matrix, but epithelial invasion was hardly detectable at all. We interpret this to suggest that active stimulation of epithelial migration/invasion through stimulatory modifications to the matrix is a component of the 26bk/d fibroblasts' influence. Fibroblasts enhance the invasion of squamous cell carcinoma cells in a similar way, with both matrix \u2018holes\u2019 and fibroblast deposition of the matrix components fibronectin and tenascin-C implicated as potential stimulatory mediators of epithelial invasion. In this case, RhoA signalling in the fibroblasts was found to be important for both hole formation and matrix deposition, which correlates with our observation of deregulation of the Rho pathway. The roles of fibronectin and tenascin-C in stimulating this migration/invasion remain to be fully elucidated. COL12A1 presents a further candidate molecule for roles in making the matrix permissive for migration/invasion as it is known to organize and stabilize matrix fibrils of collagen type I, a main matrix component in our spheroid assay. In addition, increased COL12A1 expression has recently been noted at colorectal cancer invasive fronts, implicating COL12A1 in invasion.Author contribution statementETV, TAH, AMH, and MH designed the experiments and analysed the data.

        "title": "MT1-MMP correlates with MMP-2 activation potential seen after epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast carcinoma cells.",
        "content": "We have previously reported that human breast carcinoma (HBC) cell lines expressing the mesenchymal intermediate filament protein vimentin (VIM+) are highly invasive in vitro, and highly metastatic in nude mice when compared to their VIM- counterparts. Since only VIM+ cell lines can be induced to activate matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) upon stimulation with Concanavalin A (Con A), we have examined here membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), a cell surface activator of MMP-2. Northern analysis reveals baseline expression of MT1-MMP in five of the six VIM+ cell lines studied (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, BT-549, Hs578T, MCF-7(ADR)), each of which showed variable activation of exogenous MMP-2 after treatment with Con A. In contrast, the four VIM-, poorly invasive HBC cell lines studied (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB 468, ZR-75-1) lacked baseline MT1-MMP mRNA expression, and showed no induction of either MT1-MMP expression or MMP-2-activation with Con A. Such differential MT1-MMP expression was confirmed in vivo using in situ hybridization analysis of nude mouse tumor xenografts of representative cell lines. Western analysis of the MDA-MB-231 cells revealed baseline membrane expression of a 60 kDa species, which was strongly induced by Con A treatment along with a weaker band co-migrating with that from MT1-MMP-transfected COS-1 cells (63 kDa), presumably representing latent MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP immunofluorescence strongly decorated Con A-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells in a manner consistent with membranous staining, but did not decorate the unstimulated MDA-MB-231 cells or MCF-7 cells under either condition. Collectively, the results suggest the constitutive production of active MT1-MMP which is unavailable for either MMP-2 activation or immuno-decoration until Con A treatment. Since VIM expression arises by virtue of the so-called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in invasive embryonic epithelia, we propose that this represents a major metastasis mechanism in breast carcinomas. MT1-MMP on the surface of such 'fibroblastoid' carcinoma cells may mediate a paracrine loop for the utilization of stromally produced MMP-2, and contribute to the poorer survival associated with VIM+ breast carcinomas.",

Benefiting from the synergetic effect of the bicomponent, reduced interfacial resistance between electrocatalyst and metal substrate, and more exposed catalytic sites on the microstructured film, the as-prepared electrocatalyst (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe) behaves as a highly efficient and robust oxygen evolution electrode with felicitous current density in alkaline electrolytes (1 M KOH). It requires an overpotential of only 264 mV to drive 100 mA cm\u22122 with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 20 h in 1 M KOH. In the near future, this kind of synthesis strategy can be easily extended to investigate many electrocatalysts derived from 3D alloyed foam with various ratios of the different components, opening new avenue for understanding the relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance.Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe composite materials show excellent OER electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solutions.IntroductionThe energy crisis and environmental issues are critical challenges, due to limitations of fossil fuels and population growth. In order to deal with these problems, research on new energy sources is necessary. New energy sources such as solar and wind energies are highly promising alternatives, but their use is limited by their intermittencies and geographically uneven distributions. Thus, suitable energy storage strategies are needed. Electrochemical water-splitting is one of the principle methods to garner hydrogen fuel as a clean and abundant energy resource with its high energy storage density as well as zero carbon emission. Currently, the real voltage for water splitting is much higher than the theoretical value (1.23 V) because of the intrinsic activation barrier of the catalytic centres, interfacial resistance and other voltage losses in the electric circuit. The full water splitting involves two half-reactions, whose overpotentials are further complicated by the high intrinsic activation barriers inherent to the two half reactions involved in water splitting, i.e., the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the overall rate is heavily dependent on the OER catalyst, due to the sluggish kinetics and complex reaction pathway of the OER. Up to now, noble metal oxides (RuO2 and IrO2) are considered as benchmarked catalysts, but their high cost and scarcity severely impede their wide applications.Recently, much effort has focused on inexpensive and earth-abundant elements-based materials as viable alternatives for OER, such as transition-metal sulfides, selenides, oxides, nitrides and (oxy)-hydroxides. It has been demonstrated that transitional-metal chalcogenides exhibit enhanced conductivity and the electroactive performance can be further ameliorated by doping other elements, deriving hydro(oxide) nanoshell and forming nanostructures. Doping single phase with other elements can induce the electron transfer between each element, leading to the further modulation of the adsorption of hydrogen(oxygen) molecules on the active sites and of the kinetic energy barrier of hydrogen(oxygen) evolution pathway. Previously, Xu et al. synthesizes Fe-doped Ni3S2 from NiFe foil, which requires overpotential of 282 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. The second approach for enhancing the performance of single active site can be realized by constructing new interfaces with two components, which have been demonstrated by several studies. The second component can adjust the electron density around the active sites in the first layer via the new formed interface. In some cases, the new interface allows the two components to act synergistically: one component allows H2O(OH\u2212) adsorption and the other component facilitates the O2(H2) release. It has reported in several cases that some chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts intend to transform into metal (hydro)oxides, which is verified to be active catalytic centre on the surface. Controlled formation of electroactive nanoshell on the surface has the unique advantage, retaining the electroactive performance and the excellent bulk conductivity simultaneously. For majorities of the chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts developed recently, designing materials in nanostructured form further enhances the overall performance by exposing more active sites in the solid\u2013electrolyte interface.Direct sulfurization of 3D metal foam has been proved to be an effective method to synthesize the catalysts which is seamlessly integrated with bulk conductive materials. Notably, X. Zou et al. have demonstrated that, using NF as support, Ni3S2 can be formed via one-step hydrothermal sulfides method, the exposed (210) facet leading to an excellent catalytic activity of Ni3S2 film. Using NF as support, Sun's group has synthesized Fe-doped Ni3S2 particle, benefited from the doping effects, the as-prepared material shown excellent performance and stability. However less reports have presented one-step chemically derivation of 3D alloy foam. After chemically derivation of alloy foam, it is highly possible to form new interface between two components. Furthermore, the excellent conductivity is still retained because of the integration with bulk alloy form. Most importantly, adjusting the ratio between each element in the alloy foam has the potential to form totally different scenario. Previous works normally synthesize two chalcogenide-based components with newly formed interface by electrodepositing single component precursor or by hydrothermally preparing single component precursor. The single component precursor contains at least two metal elements in the ion form. Liu et al. successfully prepared NiFeS electrocatalyst with further sulfurization process of NiFe hydroxides precursor, which showed superior OER performance.Herein, we report, for the first time, the synthesis of stable and high-performance Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 hybrid materials supported on alloy foam (Ni3Fe), dubbed Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe. One step hydrothermal method was used to prepare the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 composite, which is easy and efficient for upscale production without adding external metal ions. Nickel-iron foam was selected as a scaffold to form 3D conductive networks and promote electronic conductivity, exposing a large surface area of active sites. In addition, the synergistic interaction between Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2 can improve overall properties of the material. Therefore, in the alkaline media, the prepared Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe electrode showed superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER, which showed a small onset potential of only 1.38 V (RHE) and a low overpotential of only 166 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. Additionally, Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe also showed a small Tafel slope of 63.31 mV dec\u22121 and excellent stability.Experimental detailsMaterialsHydrochloric acid (HCl), potassium hydroxide (KOH), thiourea, acetone and ethanol were acquired from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. RuO2 and Nafion (5 wt%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Ni3Fe alloy foam, Ni foam and Fe foam were received from Kun Shan Kunag Xun Electronics Co., Ltd., China. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The water used throughout all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.Synthesis of Ni3S2\u2016NF, FeS2\u2016Fe and Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3FeFirstly, Ni3Fe alloy foam (1.4 \u00d7 3.3 cm2) was washed with acetone by sonication for 10 minutes, then the Ni3Fe alloy foam was treated with 3 M HCl by sonication for 10 minutes, finally, the Ni3Fe alloy foam was washed with water three times to get clean Ni3Fe samples. To synthesize Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe electrode, 0.8 g of thiourea was dissolved in 35 mL of deionized water under magnetic stirring for 15 minutes. Then the freshly prepared thiourea solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) containing a piece of pretreated Ni3Fe alloy foam into the solution. The autoclave was sealed and then heated at 180 \u00b0C for 16 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature naturally, the obtained Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe was washed with de-ionized water several times and then dried in vacuum. For comparison, Ni3S2\u2016Ni and FeS2\u2016Fe electrodes were also fabricated using the same procedure except that Ni foam or Fe foam was used as current collector and metal source.Materials characterizationThe crystal structure of the as-prepared Ni3Fe, and Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe samples have been measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE, Cu KR). The morphology and phase information of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SU8010). XPS was performed on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer using an Al K\u03b1 photon-source.Electrochemical characterizationAll of the electrochemical measurements were carried out with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. The as-prepared Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe were used directly as the working electrode without further treatments. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed at the potential ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 V (vs. SCE) at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) determination was conducted in the frequency range from 1.0 \u00d7 105 Hz to 1.0 Hz. The geometric surface area of the electrode is 0.2 cm2. All the measured current densities were obtained by dividing the current with the geometric surface area. The electrochemical characterizations were carried in a standard three-electrode system by using a graphite bulk counter electrode and a Hg/Hg2Cl2 (sat. KCl) reference electrode. The potentials reported here were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE): E(RHE) = E(Hg/Hg2Cl2) + 0.0591 \u00d7 pH + 0.2415 \u2212 0.000761(T \u2212 298.15).Results and discussionsMorphology and composition characterizationAs shown in Scheme 1, one-step synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 on Ni3Fe foam without addition of extra metal ions is quite straightforward. After hydrothermal sulfurization of alloy foam, mountainous terrain (Fig. 1) on macroporous foam is formed, which is totally different from the bare smooth surface of Ni3Fe foam (Fig. S1\u2020). The sample fragment scraped down from the alloy foam shows that the composite has clear edges in the low-resolution TEM image (Fig. 3b). In combination with the XRD pattern in Fig. 2, it can reason that the mountainous terrain is mainly composed of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2. More detailed information can be gleaned from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2). As for XRD pattern measured from Ni3Fe foam, the peaks at 44.2\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0, 75.8\u00b0 are corresponding to (111), (200), (220) planes of Ni3Fe (JCPDS 88-1715). After sulfurization of alloy foam, many new peaks have appeared. The peaks at 21.8\u00b0, 31.2\u00b0, 37.8\u00b0, 44.4\u00b0, 49.8\u00b0 can be ascribed to (100), (110), (111), (200), (210) planes of Ni3S2 (JCPDS 73-0698) and the peaks at 15.3\u00b0, 29.5\u00b0, 30.8\u00b0, 47.0\u00b0, 51.5\u00b0 correspond well with (111), (311), (222), (511), (440) planes of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 (JCPDS 73-0515). Therefore, it is confirmed that the formed product has two components (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2). No other impurities in the samples were revealed in XRD measurements.Schematic illustration of preparation of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 composite on Ni3Fe foam.(a\u2013c) SEM images of the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe mountainous terrain on Ni3Fe alloy foam.

A scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was utilized for measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a and d, lattice fringes with interplanar distance of 0.3 nm were clearly revealed in the high-resolution image, which corresponds to the (311) plane of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8, the distance of 0.234 nm can be ascribed to the (1\u221211) plane of the Ni3S2 phase, respectively. It indicates that the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 phase was synthesized successfully in accordance with the XRD. Elemental mapping images in Fig. 3c, e and f and EDS pattern (Fig. S4\u2020) illustrate the presence of Ni, Fe and S, further proofing the existence of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2.(a and d) High resolution TEM image of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe.

(c, e and f) Elements mapping (Ni, Fe, S) in Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe, respectively.Surface chemistryX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis is an effective approach to analyse the surface element valence and chemical bonding environments in the composite. A survey of XPS spectrum confirms the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe sample contains Fe, Ni, and S atoms. The Ni 2p XPS peaks located at 855.62 eV and 873.47 eV can be assigned to Ni2+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 binding energies, respectively (Fig. 4a). These values are consistent with those for Ni2+ in Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2. The peaks corresponding to the binding energy of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 at 724.04 and 711.24 eV demonstrate the trivalent state of Fe in the composite (Fig. 4b). The peaks of S 2p at 162.39 and 163.56 eV were attributed to negative bivalent S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4c), indicating the bivalent state of S, The peak at 168.25 eV is well matched to the highly oxidized state S4+ at the edge of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2. The above results confidently confirm the successful synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2.XPS spectra for (a) Ni 2p. (b) Fe 2p. (c) S 2p of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe.Electrocatalytic activityFor each sample measured in three-electrode system, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) were measured to assess the electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH solution (Fig. 5a). For comparison, several control samples such as bare Ni3Fe foam, Ni3S2\u2016Ni, FeS2\u2016Fe and RuO2 (loading amount: 6 mg cm\u22122) were tested. Fig. 4a shows the CV curves for OER of the tested samples at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Remarkably, the samples (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe) prepared at 180 \u00b0C show the best performance (Fig. S2\u2020) and the bare Ni3Fe foam only manifests negligible activity at overpotential of 300 mV. Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe possesses the ability to deliver current density of 10 and 100 mA cm\u22122 at overpotential of 166 and 264 mV, respectively, outperforming the above-mentioned control samples. FeS2\u2016Fe, Ni3S2\u2016Ni and RuO2 require overpotential of 330, 350 and 360 mV to achieved current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 (Fig. 5e). These results confirm that the electrocatalyst prepared in this study has enhanced activity after sulfurization and is even superior to some noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. It is proposed that direct seamless integration of electrocatalyst with conductive Ni3Fe alloy substrate plays an important role for the improved performance of OER. The simultaneous presence of Fe and Ni allows the opportunity to synthesize bicomponent electrocatalyst with potential synergistic effect. After OER tests, the Ni in Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe was oxidized to metal oxides by electro-chemical oxidation in alkaline solution, the valence of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 also shifted to higher state 856.79 and 874.53 eV and two satellite peaks at 862.65 and 880.66 eV, the energy separation between Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 is \u224817.7 eV, which indicated the existence of NiO phase by XPS spectra (Fig. S6a\u2020). Furthermore, the valence of Fe also shifted to higher state 712.40 eV and 725.30 eV with new satellites 718.31 eV and 731.49 eV related with Fe2O3 phase (Fig. S6b\u2020). Deconvolution of oxygen peak revealed one new peak as compared to OER test, indicating formation of oxygen\u2013metal bond (Fig. S7\u2020). From these analyses, it can reason that new metal-hydro(oxide) phase was produced after OER test. Furthermore, the new peak at 167.80 eV in XPS of S 2p verified the oxidation of sulfur to SO42\u2212 (Fig. S6c\u2020). A slight degradation of catalytic performance after 1000 cycles of CV test can be ascribed to the oxidation of catalytic surface (Fig. 5d).(a) CV polarization curves for OER. (b) Tafel plots with the corresponding Tafel slopes for the OER process. (c) Chronoamperometric durability test at a constant overpotential of 215 mV. (d) The CV curves before and after the durability test. (e) Overpotentials at current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. (f) Quantitative O2 measurement via water displacement.Tafel slope as a quality descriptor derived from the CV curves is used to investigate the OER catalytic kinetic performance of the samples. As shown in (Fig. 5b), the electrocatalyst (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe) shows fastest kinetics at the onset potential, demonstrated by the Tafel slope (63.31 mV dec\u22121). The Tafel slope value of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe is smaller than those of FeS2\u2016Fe (89.13 mV dec\u22121), Ni3S2\u2016Ni (65.17 mV dec\u22121), RuO2 (74.21 mV dec\u22121) and Ni3Fe alloy (64.46 mV dec\u22121). The long-term durability (Fig. 5c, d and S3\u2020) of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe for OER was assessed by applying constant overpotential of 215 mV for 20 h. After 20 h of constant overpotential test, the current density of 15 mA cm\u22122 does not change significantly, the CV curves after 1000 CV cycles has only slight shifted as compared to that before cyclic scanning, manifesting its outstanding stability for OER. The XRD characterization after stability test shows the same pattern as that before electrochemical measurements (Fig. S5\u2020). The same mountainous terrain was retained with appearance of much rougher surface possibly because of surface oxidation. XPS also reconfirmed the same trend of surface oxidation. Nevertheless, the recorded CV curve after 3000 cycles of CV almost overlapped with that after 1000 cycles. Undoubtedly, this catalyst can stabilize after formation of metal-hydro(oxide) shell without further degradation. The existence of XPS peaks of sulfur after OER stability test is an excellent evidence for retainment of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2.The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of electroactive materials can be obtained by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), given the fact that Cdl is proportional to the ECSA. The Cdl was obtained through cyclic voltammetric scans at different rates (20 to 140 mV s\u22121) and in the non-faradaic potential range. Cdl increases from 2.19 mF dec\u22121 for Ni3Fe alloy foam to 7.74 mF dec\u22121 for Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe, indicating that Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 and Ni3S2 improved the electrochemical active surface area, thus contributing to the improved electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 6a\u2013c). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was further used to investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the catalyst\u2013electrolyte interface during the OER.(a and b) CV curves of the Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe and Ni3Fe electrodes measured in 1.0 M KOH in the non-faradaic region with different scan rates from 20 to 140 mV s\u22121. (c) Current density differences (\u0394J/2) plotted against scan rates of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe and Ni3Fe. (d) Nyquist plots of different catalysts in 1.0 M KOH.Apparently, it is shown in Fig. 6d that the values of resistance charge transfer (Rct) for the five samples are arranged in the order of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe < RuO2 < FeS2\u2016Fe < Ni3S2\u2016Ni < Ni3Fe, the smaller Rct value reveals faster charge transport of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe during the OER catalytic process, which is beneficial to the generation of O2. Although the Cdl is a relatively small value, the fast electron transfer and high turnover frequency of single active site definitely offset this disadvantage. Moreover, the final activity of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2\u2016Ni3Fe is pretty competitive among recently reported electrocatalysts (Table S1\u2020).ConclusionsIn summary, we have demonstrated a simple and one-step hydrothermal approach for synthesis of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2 on Ni3Fe alloy foams. Direct growth of electrocatalyst with mountainous terrain on bulk foam endows this system with felicitous stability in strongly alkaline electrolytes, evidenced by SEM, XRD and XPS characterization after stability tests. The lowest electron transfer resistance shown by EIS further enhances the performance of Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2. Formation of thin metal metal-hydro (oxide) shell around the electrocatalyst and conductive core (Ni4.5Fe4.5S8/Ni3S2) inside may work together to boost the overall activity. With these excellent figures of merit, it requires an overpotential of only 264 mV to drive 100 mA cm\u22122 with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 20 h in 1 M KOH. Further study entails understanding the working mechanism of this system in combination with more characterization methods and theoretical calculation. It is believed that the design strategy developed in this work may provide a new perspective for designing other advanced composite materials catalysts for electrocatalysis application.Conflicts of interestThere are no conflicts to declare.Supplementary MaterialReferences"

        "content": "Tumor cell invasion into the surrounding stroma requires increased cell motility and extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Endo180 (CD280, MRC2, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein) is a recycling endocytic receptor that functions in both these cellular activities by promoting cell migration and uptake of collagens for intracellular degradation. In the normal breast, Endo180 is predominantly expressed by stromal fibroblasts. The contrary observation that Endo180 is expressed on epithelial tumor cell lines that display a high invasive capacity suggested that up-regulation of this receptor may be an associated and functional component in the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype by tumor cells in vivo. Here, we show that high levels of Endo180 are found in a subset of basal-like breast cancers and that this expression is an independent prognostic marker for shorter disease-free survival. Two potential mechanisms for Endo180 up-regulation were uncovered. First, it was shown that Endo180 can be transcriptionally up-regulated in vitro following transforming growth factor-beta treatment of breast cancer cells. Second, a proportion of Endo180(+) tumors were shown to have Endo180 gene copy number gains and amplifications. To investigate the functional consequence of Endo180 up-regulation, MCF7 cells transfected with Endo180 were inoculated into immunocompromised mice. Expression of wild-type Endo180, but not an internalization-defective Endo180 mutant, resulted in enhanced tumor growth together with a reduction in tumor collagen content. Together, these data argue that elevated expression of this receptor in tumor cells could have important consequences in subsets of basal-like carcinomas for which there is a current lack of effective treatment.",

        "content": "This is the first report about human tenascin-W, the fourth and final member of the extracellular matrix protein family of tenascins. Sixty-three human breast tumor extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of tenascin-W and compared with tenascin-C, an established marker of tumor stroma. Interestingly, we found tenascin-W expression in the majority of the tumor tissues, but no detectable expression in the normal mammary parenchyma. Eighty-one percent of the breast tumor samples were tenascin-W positive and 86% showed expression of tenascin-C. However, tenascin-W and tenascin-C amounts varied greatly between tumors and some contained either tenascin-W or tenascin-C exclusively, indicating independent mechanisms regulating their expression. Although there was no difference between high- or low-grade tumors with respect to the presence of tenascin-C, tenascin-W was more prominent in low-grade tumors. For 42 of the breast cancer tissues, a frozen tumor microarray was available to confirm the Western blot data by immunohistochemistry. Similar to tenascin-C, tenascin-W was detected in the tumor stroma. Fibroblasts adhered to tenascin-W in a beta(1) integrin-dependent manner and spread with a distinctive morphology under conditions where they remained round on tenascin-C. CHOB2 cells expressing alpha(v)beta(1) or alpha4beta(1) integrins were able to spread on tenascin-W. Furthermore, addition of tenascin-W to the culture medium increased migration of breast cancer cells toward a fibronectin substratum in vitro. These data imply that tenascin-W expression in the activated tumor stroma facilitates tumorigenesis by supporting the migratory behavior of breast cancer cells.",

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

        "title": "Characterization of inorganic phosphate transport in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.",
        "content": "Recent studies demonstrate that interstitial inorganic phosphate is significantly elevated in the breast cancer microenvironment as compared to normal tissue. In addition it has been shown that breast cancer cells express high levels of the NaPi-IIb carrier (SLC34A2), suggesting that this carrier may play a role in breast cancer progression. However, the biochemical behavior of inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in this cancer type remains elusive. In this work, we characterize the kinetic parameters of Pi transport in the aggressive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and correlated Pi transport with cell migration and adhesion. We determined the influence of sodium concentration, pH, metabolic inhibitors, as well as the affinity for inorganic phosphate in Pi transport. We observed that the inorganic phosphate is dependent on sodium transport (K0,5 value = 21.98 mM for NaCl).

In addition it has been shown that breast cancer cells express high levels of the NaPi-IIb carrier (SLC34A2), suggesting that this carrier may play a role in breast cancer progression. However, the biochemical behavior of inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporter in this cancer type remains elusive.MethodsIn this work, we characterize the kinetic parameters of Pi transport in the aggressive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and correlated Pi transport with cell migration and adhesion.ResultsWe determined the influence of sodium concentration, pH, metabolic inhibitors, as well as the affinity for inorganic phosphate in Pi transport. We observed that the inorganic phosphate is dependent on sodium transport (K0,5 value = 21.98 mM for NaCl). Furthermore, the transport is modulated by different pH values and increasing concentrations of Pi, following the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K0,5 = 0.08 mM Pi). PFA, monensin, furosemide and ouabain inhibited Pi transport, cell migration and adhesion.ConclusionsTaken together, these results showed that the uptake of Pi in MDA-MB-231 cells is modulated by sodium and by regulatory mechanisms of intracellular sodium gradient.General Significance: Pi transport might be regarded as a potential target for therapy against tumor progression.IntroductionsPhosphorus is an essential element found in all forms of life. In mammals, it is obtained from the diet in the anionic form of Pi (H2PO-4 or HPO-4) through absorption in the small intestine. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) plays a critical role in several cellular processes such as energy metabolism, either in the form of ATP by the energy transfer mechanism, or in its free form as substrates for intermediates of metabolic pathways. As a constituent of ATP, Pi also participates in the mechanisms of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of intermediates of cellular signaling events. Pi is a fundamental component of phospholipids and nucleotides of DNA and RNA. To satisfy the phosphorus requirements of a healthy mammal, the extracellular Pi is maintained under a relatively narrow range of concentration, between 0.8 and 1.5 mM. Under physiological conditions, Pi is an anionic molecule and, therefore, its diffusion through the membrane lipid bilayer is hindered, requiring thus a protein transport system for translocation from the extracellular to the intracellular medium. In mammals, several inorganic phosphate transporters have been described and can be classified into three different protein families denoted NaPi-I, NaPi-II and NaPi-III. NaPi-I (NPTI) is predominantly expressed in the border membrane of the proximal tubular brush, and functions as an intrinsic Pi transport modulator,. NaPi-II (SLC34) is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter that carries the phosphate in its monovalent form. It is further classified in the following subfamilies: NaPi-IIa (SLC34A1), NaPi-IIb (SLC34A2), and NaPi-IIc (SLC34A3); NaPi-IIb is found in breast cells. The type III, NaPi-III (SLC20) transporter family, comprises proteins responsible for a sodium-dependent phosphate transport in its monovalent form. NaPi-III is divided in two subfamilies: PiT-1 (SLC20A1) and PiT-2 (SLC20A2).Genome\u2013wide analysis strongly suggests that mutations affect both branches of the regulatory pathways that contribute, simultaneously or not, towards tumorigenesis, namely oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These may determine the gain of function of genes dictating growth control and cell survival and inactivate genes that in normal cells promote apoptosis. Given the high degree of interactivity of the network involving cellular signaling pathways and the accumulating evidence assigning to metabolic enzymes the dual role of transcription factors, it is not surprising that the cell proliferation and invasiveness typical of cancer cells are intimately connected to metabolic reprogramming and hence a distinct bioenergetic phenotype. The \u201cgrowth rate hypothesis\u201d was described in cancer cells and it was demonstrated that tumors have elevated phosphorus demands associated with protein synthesis and accelerated proliferation. According to this theory, high phosphorus is required for the rapid growth of tumor, thus having a role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Recently, it was observed that the Pi concentration in the tumor microenvironment of breast tumors is significantly elevated as compared to normal mammary glands. In addition, authors documented increased Pi concentrations in highly metastatic tumor xenografts as compared to non-metastatic tumors.There are three important receptors involved with classification of breast cancer: the receptors for the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) hormones or epidermal growth factor receptors (HER-2). According to the classification based on the expression patterns of receptors in breast cancer, there are four molecular subtypes were found: luminal A, luminal B, HER2 and triple-negative overexpression. The MDA-MB-231 cell line (classified in the triple-negative molecular subtype) is a cellular model with a high metastatic capacity and, therefore, is considered a more aggressive strain compared to MCF-7 (ER+, PR+ and HER is classified as a tumorigenic, but non-metastatic cell line).MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit increased migratory capacity upon increasing Pi concentrations in the growth medium. There are two solute carrier families of Pi transport in mammals: SLC20 and SLC34 and both protein families transport Pi using the electrochemical gradient for Na+. It has been previously described that NaPi-IIb (SLC34A2) is up-regulated in ovarian carcinomas and benign tumors compared to normal ovary tissues. Another study showed that the upregulated expression of SLC34A2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and the knockdown of this Pi transporter decrease cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. In lung cancer cells, SLC34A2 was also necessary for proliferation and tumorigenesis. Overexpression of the NaPi-IIb transporter has been described in breast cancer tumors as opposed to normal tissues and has been proposed as a novel diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the Pi transport kinetics in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line by investigating whether such biochemical features may suggest interference tactics using inhibitors that could impact upon migration and invasive capacity.Materials and methodsMaterialsReagents were bought from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Radioactive inorganic phosphate (32Pi) used was from Instituto de Pesquisas Energ\u00e9ticas e Nucleares (IPEN). In this work, we used distilled water through a Milli-Q system of resins to prepare all solutions (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA).Cell cultureMDA-MB-231, T47D and MCF-7 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in Iscoves Modified Dulbeco\u2019s Medium (IMDM\u2014LCG Biotechnology, Brazil) supplemented with sodium bicarbonate, 10% of foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cripion Biotechnology, Brazil), 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, Brazil). 67NR and 4T1 cell lines, which originated from a spontaneous mammary carcinoma arising in a BALB/c mouse, were purchased from Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI, USA). Cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), supplemented with L-GlutaMax, 10 mM sodium carbonate, Hepes Buffer and 10% FBS and maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For the experiments, cells were harvested from the culture medium, washed two times with buffer comprising of 116 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.8 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). Hank\u2019s EDTA solution was used to isolated cells from dishes. Cell number was estimated by counting in a Neubauer chamber. The protein concentration was measured with the Bradford methodology.Pi transport assay in MDA-MB-231Living MDA-MB-231 cells (104 cells) were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour in a reaction mixture (0.5 mL) containing 116 mM NaCl or choline cloride, 5.4 mM KCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4 and 2.5 \u03bcCi/nmol 32Pi. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of an ice-cold PBS buffer (pH 7.2). Cells were washed with the same cold buffer at 4\u00b0C and disrupted with 0.25 mL Hank\u2019s solution (5.37 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 136.8 mM NaCl, 0.33 mM NaH2PO4, 5.03 mM D-glucose, 4.16 mM sodium bicarbonate, 6.35 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) and 0.25 ml 0.1% SDS. These lysed cells with the internalized Pi were moved to a filter paper and, then, to a scintillation liquid. Blank values of uptake were obtained as previously described.It was used 0 to 0.5 mM of Pi to measure the substrate affinity (K0.5) and maximum rate (Vmax) of the Pi transporter. Bafilomycin A1 (100 nM), a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, and valinomycin (100 \u03bcM), the K+ ionophore, were also tested. Monensin (100 \u03bcM), a Na+ ionophore, furosemide (1 mM), a Na+-ATPase inhibitor and ouabain (1 mM), a Na+,K+-inhibitor, were tested. The H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, SCH28080 (100 \u03bcM) and the Pi transport inhibitor, phosphonoformic acid (PFA\u20145 mM) were also tested. Vehicles: DMSO 1% (bafilomycin A1, valinomycin, furosemide and SCH28080), ethanol 1% (monensin), water (ouabain and PFA); controls were performed using these vehicles. At 1% of these vehicles, the values for 32Pi uptake obtained were the same obtained with water. The viability of MDA-MB-231 was verified according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions of CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega, EUA).Real-time PCR analysisTotal RNA was purified from MDA-MB-231 cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) as described by manufacturer\u2019s manual. After treatment of RNA with DNase I, a first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) was used to generate full-length cDNA from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA. qPCR was carried in StepONE Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts, USA), using a FastStart Master SYBR Green I Kit (from Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The primers for amplification are shown in Table 1. Gene expression data were normalized to an endogenous reference \u03b2-actin (ACTB) as previously described, and according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Primers sequences.Sequence name\tSense primer(5\u2019\u2013 3\u2019)\tAntisense primer(5\u2019\u2013 3\u2019)\t \tNaPi 1\tCGTATGTCTTCTCTGGTTCGTTCTG\tCGTAAAACTACCAGTGGAAATAGCCC\t \tNaPi-IIa\tGTGGCCTCCTTCAACATCCAT\tCTGTAAGGAGTCTGGGTGGC\t \tNaPi-IIb\tCCCAGCTTATAGTGGAGAGCTTC\tGCACCAAATCTTGACAAGACTCTTG\t \tNaPi-IIc\tGAATTTCAGAGGGCTTTCAGCG\tGAGTCCAACTGCACGATGAGG\t \tACTB\tTGACGTGGACATCCGCAAAG\tCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGAGG\t \tMigration assayTumor cell migration was assayed in a 48-well Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe Microchemotaxis System, Gaithersburg, MD) using 12-\u03bcm polycarbonate filters, as previously described. 28 \u03bcl of IMDM containing 2.5% FBS was added at the bottom of the chamber as the chemoattractant. At the upper part, 5 x 104 cells/well, pretreated with ouabain, furosemide, monensin or phosphonoformic acid (PFA) for 1h, was added in 50 \u03bcL of medium in the absence of FBS. Controls were performed by pretreating the cells, for 1 h, in the specific drug diluents: 1% DMSO or 1% ethanol in 50 \u03bcL of medium in the absence of FBS., After migration for 1.5h, filters were removed from the chambers, fixed and stained with Panoptic kit (Interlab, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). Tumor cells that had migrated through the membrane were counted in a LX400 light microscopy under a 100 x objective (Labomed Inc, Los Angeles, CA) on at least five random fields. The results are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.Adhesion assay96-well tissue culture plates were performed pre-coated with 32 \u03bcg/mL ECM gel (from mouse sarcoma) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 100 \u03bcL per well for overnight in 4\u00b0C and non-specific binding sites in the wells were blocked with 1 mg/mL BSA diluted in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Cells grown at 80% confluency in IMDM with 10% FBS were pretreated with the phosphate transport inhibitors for 1h, then the cells were trypsinized, suspended in serum-free medium at the concentration of 2 x 104 cells/mL and applied 100 \u03bcL for each well incubated under routine condition as above for 3h. After incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by carefully washing twice with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cleaned with PBS two times, stained with 100 \u03bcL 0.5% crystal violet for 5 min, washed two times and lysed with 100 \u03bcL ethanol of 1% acetic acid solution read at A570. Results were expressed 100% as control.Statistical analysisAll experiments were performed, at least, three times in triplicate. The experiments were represented with values of mean \u00b1 SE. We used nonlinear regression analysis of the data to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation (K0.5 and Vmax values). Significant differences: p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).ResultsPi transport in different lineages of breast cancer cellsIn an initial approach, we assayed the Pi transport in three different human breast cancer cell lines. When we compared them, the most aggressive, MDA-MB-231, had the higher Pi transport activity (Fig 1A). In addition, we employed two isogenic murine breast cancer cells: 67NR, is a low-aggressive, nonmetastatic, cell line and 4T1, is a highly aggressive, metastatic, cell line. As seen in the human cell lines, 4T1 cells presented higher 32Pi transport than 67NR (Fig 1B). Based on these initial results, we opted to concentrate our study specifically on the MDA-MB-231-line. We next analyzed the gene expression pattern of Pi transporters. As shown in Fig 2, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited the highest NaPi-IIb gene expression levels when compared to the other NaPi transporters (Fig 2).Comparative indices of 32Pi influx in breast cancer cell lines.Intact MCF-7, T47-D or MDA-MB-231 cells (5 x 104 cells/mL = 1.45 mg protein/mL) (A) and 67NR and 4T1 (B) were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a reaction mixture containing 116 mM NaCl or 116 mM choline cloride, 5.5 mM Glucose, 5.4 KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4 and 2.5 \u03bcCi / nmol 32Pi. The results are the means \u00b1 SE of at least 3 experiments, with different cell suspensions. Asterisks mark significant differences (p\u2264 0.05) from MDA-MB-231, as determined by One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using Turkey\u2019s multiple comparisons test.Gene expression analysis of Pi transporters in MDA-MB-231 cells.Total RNA was purified from MDA-MB-231 and, after treatment of RNA with DNase I, a full-length cDNA was generated from RNA. qPCR was carried. Gene expression data were normalized to an endogenous reference \u03b2-actin (ACTB). The results are the means \u00b1 SE of 7 experiments, with different cell suspensions. Asterisks mark significant differences (p\u2264 0.05) from NaPi1, as determined by One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using Turkey\u2019s multiple comparisons test.Pi uptake and kinetic parametersThe Pi uptake in MDA-MB-231 was evaluated at different times (0 to 60 minutes) and these cells showed a linear uptake for up to 60 minutes (Fig 3A). We did not measure longer times of incorporation because it could lead to saturation. Then, all experiments were carried out at 60 minutes.Time course, NaCl dependence and Pi dependence of MDA-MB-231 32Pi influx.Intact cells (5 x 104 cells/mL = 1.45 mg protein/mL) were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a reaction mixture containing 116 mM NaCl or 116 mM choline cloride, 5.5 mM Glucose, 5.4 KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4 and 2.5 \u03bcCi/nmol 32Pi at various times (A), several NaCl concentrations (0\u2013150 mM) (B) or various concentrations of KH2PO4 (0\u20130.5 mM) (C). The results are the means \u00b1 SE of at least 3 experiments, with different cell suspensions.NaPi-II (SLC34) is a member of the sodium-dependent Pi transporter family and transports the monovalent form of Pi. Fig 3B shows the influence of NaCl on the Pi transport activity of MDA-MB-231 line. The kinetic parameters of this activity were: K0.5 = 14.11 \u00b1 2.838 mM and Vmax = 39.72 \u00b1 1.26 nmol x h-1 x mg protein-1.To evaluate the affinity of the transport for Pi, we performed the Pi uptake in the Pi concentration range of 5\u2013500 \u03bcM (Fig 3C). The transporter followed a Michaelis-Menten kinetic and the parameter values were calculated, presenting an apparent K0.5 = 84.9 \u00b1 10.4 \u03bcM and a Vmax = 71.67 \u00b1 3 nmol x h-1 x mg protein-1.pH values ranging from 6.4 to 9.2 were tested, and the transport was higher at pH 7.3\u20137.7, as shown in Fig 4A. Fig 4B shows the cell viability during the pH experiments. Thus, all the following experiments were performed at pH 7.2, the same as the mean pH of the cell culture medium.Effect of pH on NaCl-dependent 32Pi transport in MDA-MB-231.Intact cells (5 x 104 cells/mL = 1.45 mg protein/mL) were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a reaction mixture containing 116 mM NaCl or 116 mM choline cloride, 5.5 mM Glucose, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 \u03bcCi/nmol 32Pi and 10 mM HEPES, 15 mM Tris, 15 mM MES with pH ranging from 6.4 to 9.2 (A). In these pH ranges, the cells remained viable throughout the experiment according CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (B). These results are the means \u00b1 SE of at least 3 experiments, with different cell suspensions.In order to evaluate the inhibition mechanism of Pi transport, we tested some inhibitors: bafilomycin A1 (100 nM), SCH28080 (100 \u03bcM), valinomycin (100 \u03bcM), ouabain (1 mM), Furosemide (1 mM), monensin (100 \u03bcM) and PFA (5 mM) (Table 2). With the purpose of verifying the influence of H+ gradient on the Pi uptake, we tested the vacuolar H+ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and SCH28080, a H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, that were not able to inhibit the Pi transport in this cell, as well as valinomycin, a K+ ionophore. Only furosemide, ouabain, monensin and PFA inhibited the Pi transport. Taken together, these data suggest the importance of Na+ gradient to Pi transport, possibly by the involvement of an Na+,K+-ATPase and/or Na+-ATPase. The influence of PFA in Pi transport was also verified. Increasing concentrations of this inhibitor were tested and Fig 5 shows the dose-response to PFA. These inhibitors do not affect the viability of MDA-MB-231(Table 2).Effect of PFA on NaCl-dependent 32Pi transport in MDA-MB-231.Intact cells (5 x 104 cells/mL = 1.45 mg protein/mL) were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a reaction mixture containing 116 mM NaCl or 116 mM choline cloride, 5.5 mM Glucose, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 \u03bcCi/nmol 32Pi and 10 mM HEPES, in the presence of increasing concentrations of PFA. In these PFA concentrations, the cells remained viable throughout the experiment. The results are the means \u00b1 SE of at least 3 experiments, with different cell suspensions. Asterisks mark significant differences (p\u2264 0.05) from control, as determined by One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using Turkey\u2019s multiple comparisons test.Effect of different agents on Pi transport of MDA-MB-231.Condition\tActivity(nmol Pi x h-1 x mg ptn-1)\tViability(% of control)\t \tCTRL\t34.61 \u00b1 4.80\t100\t \tBafilomycin A1 (100 nM)\t31.57 \u00b1 4.78\t87\t \tSCH28080 (100 \u03bcM)\t34.60 \u00b1 6.99\t99\t \tValinomycin (100 \u03bcM)\t33.70 \u00b1 8.66\t116\t \tOuabain (1 mM)\t17.60 \u00b1 3.67*\t116\t \tFurosemide (1 mM)\t14.20 \u00b1 3.49*\t112\t \tMonensin (100 \u03bcM)\t20.70 \u00b1 5.04*\t104\t \tPFA (5 mM)\t7.65 \u00b1 1.34*\t103\t \tTriton X 100 (1%)\t-\t28\t \tReactions were performed at 37\u00b0C in a medium (final volume: 0.5 mL) containing 116 mM NaCl or choline chloride (to calculate the Na+-dependent Pi transport), 5.4 mM KCl, 5.5 mM D-glucose, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 2.5 \u03bcCi/nmol 32Pi and 5 x 104 cells/mL (1.45 mg protein/mL) in the absence or presence of other additions, as shown in the table. The results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. *Denotes significant differences (p < 0.05) after comparison with the control (no addition).Cell migration and adhesionIn order to evaluate the possible impact of Pi transport inhibition on tumor cell properties, we further tested the effect of furosemide, ouabain, monensin and PFA on cell migration and adhesion. All inhibitors were able to inhibit the migration and adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 6). Pi transport inhibitors decreased cell adhesion by approximately 50%. In the case of migration, the inhibition was also significant, especially in the presence of furosemide, ouabain and PFA. These results indicate that Pi uptake is important for pro-tumoral processes such as cell motility, migration and adhesion. None of the inhibitors affected cell viability (Table 2).Effect of inhibitors on cell migration (A) and cell adhesion (B) in MDA-MB-231. Intact cells (5 x 105 cells/mL) were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a Boyden Chamber Assay\u2122 migration (A) or in a adhesion chamber (B) in the presence or absence (control) of inhibitors indicated in the abscissa: ouabain (1 mM), furosemide (1 mM), Monensin (100 \u03bcM) and PFA (5 mM). In the presence of these inhibitors at their respective concentrations, the cells remained viable throughout the experiment. The results are the means \u00b1 SE of at least 3 experiments, with different cell suspensions. Asterisks mark significant differences (p\u2264 0.05) from control, as determined by One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using Turkey\u2019s multiple comparisons test.DiscussionInorganic phosphate (Pi) has been recently proposed as a key component of the \u201cgrowth rate hypothesis\u201d, in which tumors exhibit high phosphorus concentration due to the requirement of a high amount of ribosomes necessary to produce proteins that support the accelerated proliferation of cancer cells. Consistent with the GRH, it was reported that some tumors have higher phosphorous and RNA content than normal tissue, and that phosphorous in RNA have an important contribution to the total biomass of phosphorous in malignant rather than normal tissues. More recently, it was also demonstrated that interstitial inorganic phosphate, which is elevated in tumor microenvironment, could be a new marker of tumor progression. In this study, the authors propose that measurement of interstitial inorganic phosphate would be more sensitive and specific for tumor detection, as compared to blood Pi concentration measurements.In this work we evaluated the biochemical behavior of Pi transport in an aggressive breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 in an attempt to understand the importance of Pi to cancer cells. Initially, we compared the Pi transport of MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells. The high level of Pi transport observed in MDA-MB-231 cell line may reflect aspects of the metabolism associated to the energy demands linked to its metastatic phenotype. Conceivably, the extra Pi incorporated by MDA-MB-231 cells could be utilized as a substrate in ATP biosynthesis, thus enabling cells to sustain their typical proliferation and migration patterns. Indeed, the increased expression of Pi transporters in MDA-MB-231 cells is compatible with such a view. Other parameters have been reported that stress the distinct metabolic identities of these cell lines. For example, MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells differ in lactate secretion, 2-NBDG uptake, expression of LDH and sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors. As a matter of fact these differences should not be surprising in view of the diverse phylogenies of MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Regarding the expression of Pi transporters, NaPi-IIb has been shown to be highly expressed in breast cancer. We observed that the NaPi-IIb had a higher expression compared to other inorganic phosphate transporters in the MDA-MB-231 cell line (Fig 2).Because a high expression of Pi transporters has been described in breast cancer compared to normal tissue, we have sought to identify the biochemical profile of the Pi transporter (NaPi-IIb) in kinetic terms and to correlate the transport of inorganic phosphate with the tumor processes. According to Forster et al. and Takeda, the Pi transporter in breast cells would be sodium dependent and with high affinity for inorganic phosphate. Partially, we correlated this high affinity of the phosphate transporter in breast cancer with the high energy requirement typical of cancer cells.Pi is a tryptotic acid and, thus, has different physiological forms according to the pH range in which it is found. Thus, when the Pi transport levels at different pH ranges were tested, we observed higher levels of transport at neutral pH than at more alkaline pH. With this result, we verified that the sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate carrier has a higher affinity for Pi in the diprotic form (H2PO4) found in the blood (pH 7.2).Previous studies have demonstrated that in mammary glands NaPi-IIb was prevalently expressed as the carrier of Pi, a sodium-dependent carrier capable of transporting the Pi molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Pi transporter in tumor cells was also sodium dependent. In addition, ouabain (1 mM), furosemide (1 mM) and monensin (100 \u03bcM) were able to inhibit the transport of Pi. Furosemide inhibits the Na+-ATPase and ouabain inhibits the Na+,K+-ATPase. As a result the Na+ ion accumulates in the cytosol, leading to indirect inhibition of Pi transport. Monensin is a Na+ ionophore, undoing the gradient of this ion across the cytoplasmic membrane. Collectively these results suggest that the inhibitors may deregulate the intracellular sodium gradient and consequently affect sodium-dependent Pi transport (Fig 7).Proposed mechanism for Pi transport mechanism in MDA-MB-231 cells: Na+, K+-ATPase ouabain-sensitive in the plasma membrane and Na+-ATPase furosemide-sensitive plasma membrane coupled to Pi transport.Arrows indicate the direction of ion flow.Phosphonoformic acid is a competitive antagonist of the Pi transporter belonging to the NaPi-II family. As expected, Pi transport into breast cancer cells in the presence of this compound was inhibited in a dose dependent manner, further evidence of the existence of the Na+-dependent Pi transporter on the membrane of these cells.It was recently demonstrated in other cell types that some inhibitors of Pi transport, such as FCCP, valinomycin and SCH28080, could have metabolic effects at the mitochondrial level leading to severe ATP depletion, thus indirectly affecting the active Pi uptake. Therefore, we measured the intracellular ATP content under Pi transport conditions, in the absence or presence of monensin, furosemide, ouabain and PFA, which inhibit Pi transport in MDA-MB-231 cells. However, neither inhibitor modulated cellular ATP levels (S1 Fig).Lin et al. identified a dose-dependence of inorganic phosphate for the cell migration of the MDA-MB-231 strain, suggesting the importance of Pi for the metastatic process. Based on this result, we sought to evaluate the importance of the Pi transporter for the metastatic process. Therefore, we used the inorganic phosphate transport inhibitors (monensin, ouabain and furosemide) and the Pi transport inhibitor (PFA) in the cell migration and adhesion assays. Interestingly, we noted a significant inhibition of cell migration, as well as cell adhesion with all inhibitors of Pi transport. PFA has been reported to inhibit the NaPi transport in osteoclast cells. From these results it can be inferred that Pi directly (free Pi), or indirectly (conjugated as ATP) could be accessory to the glycolytic pathway and thus play a role in supplying energy for cellular motility and adhesion of breast cancer cells. Pi uptake appears to be related to the sodium gradient rather than to the Pi transporter itself since ouabain, furosemide and monensin decreased Pi transport, cell migration and adhesion. Therefore, the use of phosphonoformic acid clearly demonstrated that the cells were fully dependent on Pi transport for such functions.In this study, we characterized the Pi transport in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. The Pi transport was found to be Na+-dependent, had high affinity for Pi and was more active in acid pH range; it was also inhibited by classical Pi transport inhibitor, PFA. Remarkably, the inhibition of Pi transport caused significant decrease in tumor cell migration and adhesion, suggesting a prominent role for Pi transporters in tumor progression. In this context, these proteins might be regarded as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Supporting informationAbbreviationsDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideEDTAethylenediamine tetraacetic acidFBSfoetal bovine serumHEPES4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, PFA, phosphonoformic acidReferencesPhosphate Transporters and Their FunctionHigh Dietary Inorganic Phosphate Increases Lung Tumorigenesis and Alters Akt SignalingInorganic phosphate uptake in unicellular eukaryotesInorganic phosphate homeostasis and the role of dietary phosphorusPhosphate transporters in renal, gastrointestinal and other tissuesPhosphate transporters of the SLC20 and SLC34 familiesThe sodium phosphate cotransporter family SLC34The leak mode of type II Na+-Pi cotransportersCancer genome landscapesMetabolic enzymes enjoying new partnerships as RNA-Binding proteinsCell Cycle and Energy Metabolism in Tumor Cells: Strategies for Drug TherapyBiological Stoichiometry in Human CancerInterstitial Inorganic Phosphate as a Tumor Microenvironment Marker for Tumor ProgressionA potential role for caveolin-1 in estradiol-17beta-induced proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells: involvement of Src, PI3K/Akt, and MAPKs pathwaysOvercoming endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer: Current evidence and future directions.

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484).

The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively.

The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score.

        "title": "Experimental generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

        "title": "Tumor stroma-containing 3D spheroid arrays: A tool to study nanoparticle penetration.",
        "content": "Nanoparticle penetration through tumor tissue after extravasation is considered as a key issue for tumor distribution and therapeutic effects. Most tumors possess abundant stroma, a fibrotic tissue composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a barrier for nanoparticle penetration. There is however a lack of suitable in vitro systems to study the tumor stroma penetration of nanoparticles. In the present study, we developed and thoroughly characterized a 3D co-culture spheroidal array to mimic tumor stroma and investigated the penetration of silica and PLGA nanoparticles in these spheroids. First, we examined human breast tumor patient biopsies to characterize the content and organization of stroma and found a high expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; 40% positive area) and collagen-1 (50% positive area). Next, we prepared homospheroids of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts alone as well as heterospheroids combining 3T3 and 4T1 cells in different ratios (1:1 and 5:1) using a microwell array platform. Confocal live imaging revealed that fibroblasts distributed and reorganized within 48h in heterospheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and gene expression analysis showed a proportional increase of \u03b1-SMA and collagen in heterospheroids with higher fibroblast ratios attaining 35% and 45% positive area at 5:1 (3T3:4T1) ratio, in a good match with the clinical breast tumor stroma. Subsequently, we studied the penetration of high and low negatively charged fluorescent silica nanoparticles (30nm; red and 100 or 70nm; green; zeta potential: -40mV and -20mV) and as well as Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles (200nm, -7mV) in both homo- and heterospheroid models. Fluorescent microscopy on spheroid cryosections after incubation with silica nanoparticles showed that 4T1 homospheroids allowed a high penetration of about 75-80% within 24h, with higher penetration in case of the 30nm nanoparticles. In contrast, spheroids with increasing fibroblast amounts significantly inhibited NP penetration. Silica nanoparticles with a less negative zeta potential exhibited lesser penetration compared to highly negative charged nanoparticles. Subsequently, similar experiments were conducted using Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles and confocal laser scanning microscopy; an increased nanoparticle penetration was found in 4T1 homospheroids until 48h, but significantly lower penetration in heterospheroids. Furthermore, we also developed human homospheroids (MDA-MB-231 or Panc-1 tumor cells) and heterospheroids (MDA-MB-231/BJ-hTert and Panc-1/pancreatic stellate cells) and performed silica nanoparticle (30 and 100nm) penetration studies. As a result, heterospheroids had significantly a lesser penetration of the nanoparticles compared to homospheroids. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that tumor stroma acts as a strong barrier for nanoparticle penetration. The 30-nm nanoparticles with low zeta potential favor deeper penetration. Furthermore, the herein proposed 3D co-culture platform that mimics the tumor stroma, is ideally suited to systematically investigate the factors influencing the penetration characteristics of newly developed nanomedicines to allow the design of nanoparticles with optimal penetration characteristics.",

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The relative mRNA levels obtained by qRT-PCR were used to calculate the normalized log2 ratios. The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against CTGF (1:1000, ab209780), \u03b1-SMA (1:5000, ab124964), FAP (1:1000, ab207178) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, TA-10), and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, ZB-2301) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, ZB-2305) antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate was used to visualize the blots with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit. The total protein concentration was also examined, and then the concentrations of secreted protein of different samples were normalized to corresponding total protein.Lentiviral TransductionThe pLV-EF1\u03b1-CTGF-CMV-Puro lentiviral plasmid (CTGF-OE), negative control lentiviral plasmid (NC), CTGF-specific shRNAs (sh-CTGF), negative control shRNAs and the according lentivirus were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Co. (Shanghai, China). Viral titres of approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 infectious units/ml were obtained. Lentivirus infection was performed with polybrene according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs.

The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h.

Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates Fibroblast Expression of CTGF and Inhibits the Ability of Breast Cancer Cells to Transform Fibroblasts Into CAF-Like CellsBecause CTGF is associated with the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, we examined the effect of ATL-1 on CTGF expression in fibroblasts. We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation.

All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.Atractylenolide-I Sensitizes Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Paclitaxel in a Mouse ModelFinally, we analyzed the effect of ATL-1 on chemosensitivity in vivo. We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6).

Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox hazard regression analysis.ResultsAssociations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological characteristics of early breast cancerTMAs from tumours of two different randomised studies on tamoxifen benefit in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal women 18, 19, was subjected to PDGFR\u03b2 IHC analyses and scored as previously described (Figure 1) 10, 11.Tumour stromal PDGFR\u03b2 immunohistochemical staining in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.

No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

IntroductionTumors are pathological complexes composed of tumor cells and the tumor stroma or tumor microenvironment (TME), which consists of cellular and acellular components, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), macrophages, blood vessels, pericytes, and extracellular matrices (ECM). In fact, CAFs induce a cancer phenotype and are responsible for the production of proteolytic enzymes, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. CAFs contribute up to 90% of the macroscopic tumor mass, provide mechanical support to tumor cells and control their survival, metastasis, proliferation, and resistance to therapies. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts and epithelial/endothelial cells, and adipocytes and pericytes that transdifferentiate to mesenchymal cells; therefore, they represent a heterogeneous cell population within the TME.Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a membrane-anchored peptidase expressed by CAFs at the stromal level of various tumor entities and contributes to progression and a worse prognosis. FAP degrades denatured collagens and participates in tumor growth via a non-enzymatic mechanism.Diagnostic FAP inhibitor radiotracers under clinical evaluation use 18F and 68Ga linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine and cyclo-[benzene(trimethanethiol-DOTA)-Met-Pro-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Met] (FAPI-2286) structures, which are radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography), and only one work has reported 99mTc, also linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine for SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging. Internationally, the amount of equipment available for molecular imaging studies is predominantly higher for gamma cameras (SPECT modality), and they represent more than 70% of the total. For SPECT images, the most-employed radionuclide is 99mTc. Therefore, the need for target-specific radiopharmaceuticals labeled with 99mTc is increasing within the field of oncology. Our group previously reported [99mTc]Tc-((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl) boronic acid ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP) as a new SPECT radioligand capable of specifically detecting FAP expressed by CAFs located in the cancer stroma and, to our knowledge, the first ligand based on 99mTc-labeled boron-Pro derivatives. Furthermore, the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP biokinetic\u2013dosimetric evaluation in healthy volunteers and three cancer patients diagnosed with breast, lung, and cervical cancer showed favorable biokinetics and uptake in primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases, achieving high-quality and high-contrast molecular images.This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity.2. ResultsNo adverse events related to the diagnostic use of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP were observed. Table 1 shows the general characteristics of patients included in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging evaluation. A detailed cancer staging of patients is shown in Table A1 (Appendix A). Patient imaging results were categorized into two groups. Patients with gliomas (n = 5), with which SPECT and SPECT/MR images were acquired, were identified as the first group. The second group involves all cases (n = 27) of breast, lung, colon, NET, renal cortex, and cervical cancer, in which SPECT/CT and PET/CT images were obtained.[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas (T/Bc range 6.3\u201313.9) (Table 2) and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma (Figure 1). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging resolution and contrast were good enough for the high-grade glioma, which could allow the performing of non-invasive diagnoses to differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas based on their distinct FAP expression. For all cancer cases, a total of 111 lesions were evaluated, which were classified as primary tumors (PT)(n = 26), lymph node metastases (LNm) (n = 61), and distant metastases (Dm) (n = 24) (Table 3). All primary tumors were detected with both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and [18F]FDG PET/CT (Figure 2 and Figure 3), which did not occur with LNm and Dm lesions (Figure 4 and Figure 5). That is, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT detected PT (100%), LNm (51%), and Dm (17%) in contrast to [18F]FDG PET/CT, which detected PT (100%), LNm (100%), and Dm (88%) (Table 3). The non-detection of LNm and Dm with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP could be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), including those not detected in NT and lung cancer, but not in 39% of the lesions with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Additionally, none of the Dm lesions detected by [18F]FDG in patients with triple negative and luminal B HER2+ molecular subtypes at the bone, liver, and lung exhibited [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake.These results are expected since FAP expression decreases once the cells succeed to invade. FAP is a protein that promotes metastasis; therefore, once the micrometastasis is established in a distant site from the PT, it loses its FAP expression. The signaling mediated by FAP/integrins/PI3K has a negative effect on IGF2 expression (associated with increased glucose uptake). This fact probably explains why as FAP uptake in Dm decreases, FDG uptake increases. As a unique feature of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP images, a very low background was achieved as previously reported (Figure 3). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake was considerably lower regarding [18F]FDG in patients with cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the adrenal cortex, which agrees with their relatively low FAP expression in comparison to lung and breast cancer (Figure 2). In general, the Dm lesions detected with [18F]FDG did not show [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, except for peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in recurrent colorectal cancer, which only showed [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, but not [18F]FDG uptake (Figure 5). CAFs are abundant in mesothelial metastases, and, through the mesothelial-mesenchymal transformation mechanism, it is likely that in carcinomatosis there is a greater transdifferentiation of mesenchymal cells towards CAFs FAP+.When comparing the values obtained from the average tumor-to-background ratios of the different background sites [T/Bm (tumor/mediastinum), T/Bl (tumor/liver) and T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle)] for all lesions, the highest values were T/Bp for both imaging methods (Figure 6). Although no statistically significant difference was found, the values of the T/Bp ratios were higher with [18F]FDG than with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (Figure 6). In the T/B data, the same trend is observed in terms of a higher uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the primary tumors compared to that obtained in the lymph node and distant metastases (Figure 6).In the case of breast cancer, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP showed a significant positive correlation between the T/Bp value of the primary tumors and the molecular subtype (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8085), where HER2+ and Luminal B HER2+ enriched subtypes showed the highest T/Bp ratios (Figure 7). The [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in HER2+ could be associated to the Erb2-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr654 of \u03b2-catenin, which promotes the activation of Wnt signaling pathways and the consequent promotion of the tumor invasive capacity (FAP expression) through a very common mechanism in breast cancer, the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, induced by the microenvironment, which infers the gain of invasive capacity and the arrest of the cell cycle, while, at the signaling level, it implies the repression of E-cadherin expression through snail/slug. In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp ratio was observed and there was no significant correlation among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027) (Figure 7). 3. DiscussionThe expression of FAP is an indication that the cell is expressing an invasive phenotype associated with an intense process of differentiation, typical of the first stages of carcinogenesis. During this phase, there is an intense activation of signaling pathways aimed at promoting the differentiation of cell precursors towards the activated fibroblast phenotype. As the tumor evolves, the stroma changes genetically and epigenetically to generate the appropriate niche for its stage. Cellular plasticity allows cells to adapt to their microenvironment through reprogramming processes (phenotypic and genotypic modifications) for tumor progression. RNAs produce epigenetic modifications that alter transcription, activating stem cell transformation and EMT processes (including FAP expression), which are essential for invasion to occur. FAP is overexpressed by CAFs from various tumor entities, making it a promising biomarker and target for many medical interventions. CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4) are classified depending on the expression of six markers: integrin b1/CD29, \u03b1-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+).In their study, Kratochwil et al. demonstrated the elevated and selective uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-04 in the stroma of multiple tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and NET cancer. However, this research demonstrated the tumor stroma imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP as the first SPECT radioligand based on a boron-Pro derivative.The results showed that the detection of primary tumor lesions with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is consistent when compared with [18F]FDG. However, when detecting LNm and Dm, the superiority of [18F]FDG is clear. This fact can be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), but not in 39% of the tumors with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Thus, our findings are discussed from the perspective of tumor stroma heterogeneity in lesions with enough size to be detected by SPECT. As mentioned, the dynamics of differentiation in the tumor microenvironment are attributed to genetic and non-genetic changes in tumor cells, the composition of the extracellular matrix, cell\u2013cell interactions, and cell heterogeneity. Based on this, it is likely that the increased uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP by primary tumors due to the presence of increased amounts of CAF-S1 FAP+ indicates an active EMT process, which is known to happen in the early phases of carcinogenesis, through which the dissemination of cells from the primary mass to distant sites is promoted. EMT involves the regulation of both intercellular adhesions by decreasing E-cadherin and increasing N-cadherin, as well as substrate adhesions through integrin mediated primarily by TGF-B, \u03b2-catenin, and the Wnt signaling pathway.On the other hand, hypoxic and hypoglycemic tumor stroma synergistically promotes the EMT phenotype in carcinomas. Thus, tumors where GLUT1 expression is commonly increased will also have an inability to express an (invasive) EMT phenotype. Accordingly, it is likely that the lack of uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in LNm and Dm is related to the fact that in this type of lesion there is an increase in the expression of GLUT1 receptors that leads to an increase in glucose metabolism, which produces a rise in the uptake of [18F]FDG and, at the same time, inhibits EMT (including FAP expression). The neoplasm with the largest number of patients in this study was breast cancer, which showed a significant positive correlation in PT between the T/Bp value and the molecular subtypes, with the highest T/Bp ratios for the HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes HER2+. The T/Bp values in HER2+ breast cancer showed a significant decrease in the LN metastases regarding PT (Figure 7), which may be due to crosstalking (cross-regulation), which occurs between integrins and EGFR receptors, such as HER2. Additionally, it is known that the Wnt signaling pathway promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in a HER2-dependent manner. It was recently confirmed that the expression of HER2 in the cell membrane is heterogeneous and that the accumulation of HER2 occurs in regions where adhesion to the extracellular matrix is dynamic. Therefore, HER2 expression decreases in regions where focal adhesions are concentrated, and the relative local decrease in HER2 expression in LNm, compared to PT, is probably related to the metastatic process. As a relevant point, it is noted that the presence of CAFs in the tumor stroma of breast cancer is associated with resistance to immunotherapy, since the elements secreted by CAFs derived from HER2+ tumors regulate resistance to treatment in a paracrine way. Thus, the decrease in [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake by LNm could indicate greater sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment.Highly-relevant data have been reported on axillary LNm in breast cancer: (1) the stroma represents around 25\u201330% of the invaded areas (regardless of subtype); (2) the predominant CAF subpopulations are CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (the latter being the most abundant); (3) CAFs enrichments are different in LNm compared to PT; (4) the secretion of CXCL12\u03b2 by CAF-S1 and the expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells is involved in the initiation of EMT and in the distant metastatic process, particularly in lung and bone; and (5) the global stromal content in LNm provides a prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients and, therefore, the CAF-S1/CAF-S4 abundance status exhibits a prognostic value, since both present pro-invasive properties with different modes of action; however, CAF-S4 is known to have a greater impact on distant metastatic spread (Dm), particularly on the liver.CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12\u03b2, promoting the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the cell differentiation into CD25+FOXP3+ cells. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells is also enhanced by CAF-S1. CAF-S4 is highly contractile and induces cancer cell invasion in three dimensions through Notch signaling. CAF-S1 FAP+ is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2+ and triple negative), confirming that FAP+ is a poor prognostic marker.Summarizing, the relatively low performance of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in detecting LNm and Dm may be related to the molecular biology of cancer and the proportion of the enrichment of CAF-S1 FAP+, which is not the most abundant in metastatic lesions (LN or distant) (Figure 8). Even when the FAP expression is associated with a phenotype that tends to transmigration and proliferation, attention must be placed on the fact that its expression is temporary and that it depends largely on the tumor microenvironment dynamics; thus, when the characteristics of the tumor stroma are modified, FAP expression and cancer prognosis can change.Our results differ from the work of K\u00f6mek et al., where they showed that PET/CT [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 is superior to [18F]FDG in the detection of primary mammary lesions and metastases (ganglionic and visceral) in twenty patients with breast cancer, both in primary and recurrent lesions, although the average size of the evaluated LNm was 10 mm. On the other hand, Backhaus et al. evaluated the use of PET/MRI with the ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT in 19 women with breast cancer with evidence of high uptake in the primary lesions (mean diameter of 26 mm) and LNm (average diameter of 21 mm). Our results probably vary from the previous research carried out due to the heterogeneity of the sample with respect to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, the image acquisition time, and the different image acquisition method (SPECT/CT vs. PET/CT vs. PET/MRI). The dynamic behavior of FAP is firmly associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution (tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, the promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation), which deserves to be used as a tool for the detection of the heterogeneity of the tumor stroma in the different stages of cancer through molecular imaging with specific radiotracers, such as [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. Therefore, additional clinical studies must be performed, including the results of the ex vivo FAP expression in tumors (immunohistochemical evaluation) to be correlated with the uptake of FAP inhibitory radiotracers. Today, CAFs is receiving considerable attention in the field of cancer biology. Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic targeting of FAP has been described in different modalities, such as vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles. In preclinical studies, CAF-S1 FAP+ has shown to cause resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduce antitumor immunity. CAFs from breast, ovarian, lung, pancreas, and colon cancer have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2; particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset. Additionally, the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.Taking into account the deleterious effect of metastases on the survival of breast cancer patients, our data could heighten the interest in evaluating the abundance of the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation, in vivo, in a non-invasive manner, by means of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT in axillary LNm during the initial clinical approach (staging) to determine the prognosis and the benefit of therapies, such as anti-FAP, anti-TGF\u03b2, anti-CXCR4, and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, in combination with standard therapies (Figure 8). More prospective research is needed to enrich the information obtained so far and we believe that future research can be focused on the function of FAP ligands in different molecular and histological subtypes of breast cancer, as well as their potential in detecting relapse of the disease, in the evaluation of the response to therapy and the prognosis of the patient.Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a complication of various malignant tumors and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. The superiority of uptake by [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in peritoneal carcinomatosis, due to recurrent colon cancer observed in the patient included in this study, agrees with the findings previously described, demonstrating a greater sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 for the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with various types of cancer.The findings observed in patients with glioma coincide with the data previously reported by R\u00f6hrich et al., where they showed little or no uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 in low-grade WHO II gliomas and high uptake in gliomas of high WHO III-IV grade, regardless of HDI status; therefore, its usefulness could lie mainly in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus post-treatment changes and in surgical and/or radiotherapy planning, for which more prospective studies are needed in this regard.4. Materials and Methods4.1. ReagentsAn iFAP (boron-Pro ligand) lyophilized kit for 99mTc labeling was obtained from the National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico) with GMP certification. [99mTc]TcO4Na was eluted from a generator (99Mo/99mTc GETEC, ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico). Other reagents were received from Millipore Co. (Burlington, MA, USA). 4.2. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP PreparationAfter the reconstitution of the iFAP lyophilized kit with a [99mTc]TcO4Na/0.2 M phosphate buffer (1:1 v/v, 2 mL, 740 MBq) solution and incubation in a block heater (92 \u00b0C, 15 min), the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP radioligand was obtained with a radiochemical purity (R.P.) greater than 98% (HPLC, Discovery C18 column, 5 \u00b5m particle size, I.D. of 0.46 cm, length of 25 cm; Supelco, Millipore, Burling-ton, MA, USA; coupled to a UV\u2013Vis detector and a radiometric detector), applying the following linear gradient: a flow rate of 1 mL/min, 0.1% TFA/water (A) (from 100 to 50%, over 10 min, maintained for 10 min, 30% over 5 min, and returned to 100% over 5 min) and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile (B). As previously reported, the lyophilized formulation contains the HYNIC-iFAP (((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)boronic) ligand with a specific alignment to the corresponding regions of the FAP binding site, stannous chloride as a reducing agent, as well as ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) to complete the coordination sphere of the [Tc(V)]HYNIC core (Figure 9).The chemical characterization of the iFAP ligand included analysis by mass spectrometry (UPLC-mass), 1H\u2013NMR, UV\u2013Vis and FT-IR. Radiochemical characterization included reversed-phase radio-HPLC and ITLC-SG (instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel) with the following mobile phases: 2-butanone, 0.1 M sodium citrate, and ammonium acetate-methanol (1:1 v/v), as reported in detail previously.4.3. PatientsThirty-two patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 50.8 \u00b1 16.7 years; 28 women and 4 men) with different types of cancer (breast cancer (n = 21), lung cancer (n = 2), adrenal cortex NETs (n = 1), colorectal cancer (n = 1), cervical cancer (n = 3) and gliomas (n = 5)) were included.The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n = 5 gliomas) and Group 2 (n = 27 breast, lung, colon, renal cortex NET, and cervical cancer). The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and with a detailed clinical description in Appendix A (Table A1). All oncological diagnoses were determined histopathologically (Table 2).The patients underwent SPECT/CT 1\u20133 h (with an average of 2 h) after the intravenous application of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5MBq). In Group 1, only of the brain region, and in Group 2, the thoracoabdominal region. The tumor/background ratio is optimal for diagnostic images from 30 min post-injection. However, it was decided 2 h after radiotracer administration to improve the contrast of the images (lesions vs. background). The acquisition protocol and the post-injection waiting time were the same for all types of cancer evaluated. However, in patients with cervical cancer or pelvic etiology, immediate image acquisition was performed post-micturition to reduce the artifact of radiotracer accumulation in the urine.All patients in Group 1 had previous cranial MRI (6 \u00b1 1 days interval) and patients in Group 2 had previous [18F]FDG PET/CT studies carried out (11 \u00b1 12.6 days interval).This research was performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the National Cancer Institute (INCan), Mexico. The patients signed an informed consent declaration, and the protocol was approved by the institutional Nuclear Medicine Ethics Committee. 4.4. Image Acquisition[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT images were acquired with a dual-head gamma camera (SPECT/CT, Symbia TruePoint, Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA), with low-energy, high-resolution collimators; parameters: window at 140 keV, matrix size of 128 \u00d7 128, with dispersion correction, 90 images of 8 s, rotation of 360 degrees. For the attenuation correction map, the low-dose CT parameters were obtained. A Butterworth filter (cutoff: 0.5, 5th order) and an iterative method (8 iterations /4 subsets) were used for the reconstruction of the raw data.SPECT/CT images were acquired 2 h after the intravenous administration of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5 MBq). The anatomical region studied in Group 1 was only the brain and in Group 2 it was thoracoabdominal. Activity in regions of interest was quantified, via 3D imaging, as Bq/cm3.All patients in Group 2 had undergone a prior PET/CT (Excel 20) scan (Siemens Medical Solutions), performed at 1 h after [18F]FDG administration (CT: slice thickness of 5 mm, 180 mAs and 120 kVp). Whole-body scans were obtained in 3D mode from the vertex to mid-thighs (2\u20133 min per bed position). PET images were reconstructed using a two-dimensional expectation algorithm of ordered subsets.4.5. Image AnalysisImages obtained with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG were examined on a Siemens VG60 multimodal workstation. Visual and semi-quantitative analyses were performed by two physicians with more than 9 years of experience in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (workstation with processing software for volumetric analysis).Visual analysis was performed on both groups of patients. Uptake was compared with the morphology of the corresponding lesion using CT and/or MRI, depending on the patient group. The detected lesions were divided into three categories for study: primary tumor (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). The semiquantitative analysis of lesion uptake was obtained by calculating the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B) with spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) to homogenize the data obtained with both radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, in Group 2, the concordance of uptake between both radiotracers was compared by quantifying the number of lesions (PT, LNm, and Dm).4.6. Tumor Tissue SamplesAll patients underwent a biopsy of the primary tumor lesion. Histopathology was used to determine the existence of viable tumor tissue and to verify the diagnosis. The histopathological reports were interpreted by a certified and experienced pathologist.4.7. Statistical AnalysisThe Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the T/Bp [99mTc]Tc-iFAP values and the molecular subtypes of the patients with breast cancer; a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.5. ConclusionsThe results of this pilot study show that SPECT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is a promising and potentially useful tool in the evaluation of the tumor microenvironment of multiple solid neoplastic entities. Within the different types of cancer that we included, we observed a potential panorama in the prognostic evaluation of recently diagnosed breast cancer, as well as its probable diagnostic superiority in peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent colon cancer. [18F]FDG was superior to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the detection of LNm and Dm. However, with the analyses carried out, we can establish that the role of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is not to displace metabolic molecular imaging, but rather that it serves as a complement for an adequate prognostic evaluation.Further prospective [99mTc]Tc-iFAP clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization, G.F.-F., P.V.-A., E.A.-V. and M.L.-G.; methodology, P.V.-A., M.L.-G., P.C.-T. and B.S.-B.; formal analysis, P.V.-A., C.S.-C., G.F.-F., F.O.G.-P., B.O.-G. and E.A.-V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.V.-A. and G.F.-F.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.F.-F.; funding acquisition, M.L.-G. and C.S.-C.

Four CAF subpopulations have been reported in the lymph node metastases of breast cancer (CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The most relevant and predominant are CAF-S1 FAP+ and CAF-S4 FAP-. Pelon et al. established a model of clinical application to the knowledge generated from the different subpopulations, in such a way that a prognostic impact is proposed according to the predominance of CAFs as follows: if at the time of diagnosis the patient exhibits low content of CAF-S1 FAP+ in LNm, they present a low risk of late Dm ((a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-), no uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal A breast cancer); on the other hand, if high levels of CAF-S1 FAP+ are demonstrated in LNm, the risk of distant metastasis increases ((b) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(+), uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal B HER2+ breast cancer). Finally, in distant metastatic lesions, only CAF-S4 FAP- is expressed [(c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-) in lung Dm and extremely low uptake in some right axillary lymph nodes that exhibit hypermetabolism with [18F]FDG; likewise, (d) multiple lung and liver metastases did not exhibit uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP].

        "content": "The purpose of this study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancer according to its cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype. Immunohistochemistry staining of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), Ki-67, podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), S100A4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), PDGFR\u03b2, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2) was performed on tissue microarray consisting of 642 breast cancer cases. Samples were categorized into luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) according to immunohistochemical results, whereas tumor stroma was classified into desmoplastic, sclerotic, normal-like, or inflammatory type based on histological findings. Expression of CAF-related proteins in the stroma differed depending on breast cancer molecular subtypes. All CAF-related protein expression was high (p &lt; 0.05) in HER-2 type, whereas in luminal A, the expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2 was low, and in TNBC, the expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and S100A4 was low. In the stromal component, CAF-related protein expression differed according to stromal phenotype (p &lt; 0.001). The desmoplastic type showed high expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, S100A4, PDGFR\u03b1, and PDGFR\u03b2, whereas the sclerotic type exhibited low expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2. The inflammatory type had high expression of FAP\u03b1 and NG2 with low podoplanin, while normal-like type showed low expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and S100A4. Our results suggested that differential CAF-related protein expression depended on the molecular subtypes and stromal histologic features of breast cancer, indicating that in the future, this system could potentially use these markers for prognosis prediction and targeted therapy of breast cancer.",

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

Stromal-epithelial interactions in the mammary gland also play an important role in cancer development. This so-called reactive stroma differs from the stroma of the normal mammary gland, exhibiting changes similar to those seen with wound healing, such as fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodelling, although in an uncontrolled manner. The stromal-epithelial interactions between fibroblasts and the luminal and myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland are important for normal development, and it has been postulated that cancer may be a physiological response to abnormal extracellular environment, and that disruptions in stroma-epithelium reactions may accelerate carcinogenesis. Conversely, normal stroma can efficiently inhibit the expression of characteristics of neoplasm. Most notably, it has previously been demonstrated that irradiation of the cleared mammary fat pad of mice causes malignant progression of transplanted normal mammary cells.Fibroblasts produce stromal ECM proteins and secrete many growth factors and hormones, including hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, TGF-\u03b23, fibroblast gowth factor (FGF)-7, FGF-2, FGF-10 and interleukin-6. Fibroblasts are also involved tumourigenesis, through the synthesis, deposition and remodelling of the ECM that occurs in mammary carcinoma, and are also the main source of paracrine factors that influence the growth of carcinoma cells. In vitro culture and in vivo tissue recombination systems demonstrate that factors derived from tumour fibroblasts stimulate tumour progression of nontumourigenic epithelial cells.Breast carcinoma is accompanied by changes in both the acellular and cellular components of the microenvironment, the latter typified by a switch from normal mammary fibroblasts (NMFs) to myofibroblasts during cancer progression. Myofibroblasts, also known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have smooth muscle phenotypic properties, typified by the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in vivo and in vitro. In primary cultures from normal human breast tissue, there are few or no \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal cells, although high frequencies have been observed in primary cultures from breast carcinomas. CAFs also express fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a 93 kDa cell surface protein of reactive-tumour stromal cells that is not present in most normal human adult tissue.CAFs were first identified over 30 years ago in healing rat wounds, and may influence the propensity of luminal epithelial cells to undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and hence become malignant. CAFs differ from NMFs also in their increased expression of growth factors, and different profiles of ECM molecule synthesis and ECM-altering proteases and protease inhibitors. The role played by fibroblasts in the development or progression of cancer is not yet fully understood, and the use of physiologically relevant co-culture models using fibroblasts from normal and cancer stroma may provide a tool for the analysis of the effect of fibroblasts.PMC42-LA is a heterogeneous human breast cancer cell line with stem cell-like properties. When cultured within a reconstituted extracellular matrix (Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma [EHS] matrix) PMC42-LA cells form hollow, alveolar-like structures, or organoids, that express \u03b2-casein in the presence of lactogenic hormones. In the presence of EGF, PMC42-LA cells in two-dimensional culture undergo an EMT. Depending on the tissue culture environment, PMC42-LA can exhibit luminal epithelial or myoepithelial markers. These inducible features of PMC42-LA, in addition to the many breast-like characteristics originally described, make PMC42-LA an attractive cell culture model for investigation of the differential effects NMFs and CAFs.We previously showed that fibroblasts induce a myoepithelial switch in PMC42-LA cells, with primary mammary fibroblasts being more effective than immortalized skin fibroblasts. In the present study we investigated the differential effects of CAFs compared with NMFs on the phenotype and behaviour of PMC42-LA cells and organoids. Our results provide direct evidence for a role for CAFs in contributing to cellular disorganization and loss of cell-cell adhesion, and demonstrate that CAFs, as compared with NMFs, significantly increase the migratory/invasive ability of PMC42-LA cells.Materials and methodsCell culturePMC42-LA cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% (vol/vol) foetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Trace, Melbourne, Australia). Primary human NMFs were isolated from human breast tissue with appropriate consent from women undergoing reduction mammoplasty, in accordance with the standards of St. Vincent's Hospital Human Ethics Committee. Primary mammary CAFs were obtained from minced tumour tissue of a mammary tumour biopsy. Tissue was minced and digested with 200 ml collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 100 ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (1:1) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS containing penicillin, streptomycin and amphoporicin B (Thermo Electron Corporation, Melbourne, Australia) overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide with gentle rocking. Digested tissue was centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in medium and filtered through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer. The cells were allowed to attach overnight, cultured in growth medium as above, and used within 10 passages. SV40 immortalized human skin fibroblasts (GM847), obtained for diagnostic purposes, were grown and maintained in basal medium (Eagle's) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) for use as a control. Cells were passaged in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) when confluent; primary cells were passaged a maximum of 11 passages.To induce organoid formation of PMC42-LA cells, 150 \u03bcl undiluted EHS (Sigma-Aldrich) was spread with a cell scraper on chilled PET track-etched/porous membrane cell culture inserts (0.4 \u03bcm pore size; Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The filters were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30\u201345 min to allow the EHS to set. Once set, 150 \u03bcl diluted (4% vol/vol in chilled distilled water) EHS was placed on the surface of the set EHS, followed by 2 ml of RPMI 10% FBS (ThermoTrace) containing 106 PMC42-LA cells. Then, 3 ml RPMI 10% FBS was placed beneath the filter using a pipette. Cells were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide before processing. For EHS matrix with fibroblasts beneath the filter, the same procedure was followed except that 0.5 \u00d7 105 previously trypsinised fibroblasts (NMFs or CAFs) were placed in the well beneath the filter insert with 1 ml DMEM/Ham's F-12 (10% FBS; Thermo Electron Corporation) and 2 ml RPMI (Thermo Trace).Conditioned mediumFor conditioned medium experiments, attached confluent fibroblasts were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fresh DMEM:Ham's F-12 (10% FBS) media added to flasks. Flasks were returned to 37\u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide, and after 48 hours the conditioned medium was collected, double filter sterilized using an eccentric tip syringe (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and sterile nonpyrogenic 0.2 \u03bcm filter (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience, Keene, NH, USA), and used at a 1:1 ratio in addition to fresh RPMI on top or beneath the filter.Media concentrationEither 10 ml (1\u00d7), 5 ml (2\u00d7), 2.5 ml (4\u00d7), or 1 ml (10\u00d7) fresh DMEM:Ham's F-12 (10% FBS) was added to confluent NMFs. After 24 hours, medium was collected and used to culture PMC42-LA cells on glass cover slips before scratch wound assays.Cell countsCell counting was conducted using a standard haemocytometer, and cell viability tests were conducted using dye exclusion with trypan blue solution (0.4%; Sigma-Aldrich).Migration assayNitric acid-treated glass cover slips were used to culture PMC42-LA cells in six-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) for scratch tests. Using a sterilized plastic cafeteria fork, a series of scratches were made on confluent cover slips and these were processed for indirect immunocytochemistry as described below. For each cover slip, four scratches were made, averaging between 367 \u03bcm (minimum) and 392 \u03bcm (maximum) width, at time 0. Each scratch was measured at several time points and averaged, and the extent of wound closure was measured microscopically, compared with the original width of scratches and averaged. Data were processed and standard deviation calculated using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA).AntibodiesMouse anti-human \u03b2-actin, anti-human catenin-\u03b2 and goat anti-human vimentin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Anti-mouse horse-radish peroxidase conjugated antibody from Sigma-Aldrich was used as a secondary antibody in Western blot analysis.Protein extraction and quantificationConfluent PMC42-LA cells cultured in flasks were treated with 0.05% (vol/vol) trypsin/EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich), cell suspensions were centrifuged and the pellet re-suspended in 5 ml PBS. Following two washes in PBS and re-centrifugation, the pellets were stored at -80\u00b0C until needed, or prepared for quantification as described.PMC42-LA cells cultured in EHS to form organoids were washed twice in PBS, following which 2 ml of 5 mg/ml dispase (Sigma-Aldrich; 20 mg/ml stock concentration) in RPMI/10% FBS was added to the filters. The filters were incubated for 30 to 90 min, or until cells were detached. Cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice with PBS, and the pellet was dried and then stored at -80\u00b0C.Cell pellets were re-suspended in 500 \u03bcl of 1% (weight/vol) SDS in 10 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) on ice and homogenized by passaging through a 21-guage needle 15 times on ice, after which cells were sonicated (40% power output, 30% duty cycle) twice using a Microson Ultrasonic cell disrupter (Misonix Incorporated, Farmingdale, NY, USA). Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Perbio, Rockford, IL, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm.SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysisProteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 10 V for 40 min. The membranes were blocked in 1% (weight/vol) casein/Tris-buffered saline (TBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C in a sealed bag. Following this, the membrane was exposed to the appropriate antibody diluted in 1% casein/TBS at varying concentrations overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then washed three times for 10 min each in 1% (weight/vol) casein/TBS. The membrane was then exposed to anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase conjugated antibody, diluted at 1:2,000 in 1% (weight/vol) casein/TBS, for 2 hours at room temperature. The membrane was then washed twice in 1% (weight/vol) casein/TBS for 10 min and, finally, in TBS Tween 20 solution twice for 15 min each. A Roche BM chemiluminescence Blotting substrate POD kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and placed on membranes for 2 min, after which the membranes were placed inside a LAS-3000 Fuji Film intelligent dark box. The illuminated bands were detected and the image captured using Image reader LAS-3000 software. For each result given, Western blot analysis was performed on three separate occasions with new cell lysates.To re-probe membranes and analyze protein loading, membranes were stripped with a re-blot solution (Re-blot plus strong; Chemicon International Inc.) at a 1:10 dilution, in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was then blocked with 1% (weight/vol) casein/TBS for 1 hour at room temperature and re-probed with anti-\u03b2-actin (1:5,000 in 1% casein/TBS) as a control for protein loading and processed, as described above, as a control for protein loading.DensitometryTo determine the density of the bands present in Western blots, a Multi-Gauge V2.3 program (FUJIFILM Medical Systems Inc., Stamford, Connecticut, USA) was used to read band densities. Data were processed, standard deviations calculated, and t-tests performed using Microsoft Excel software.Indirect immunocytochemistry of cultured cellsOnce confluent, cells cultured on glass cover slips were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 4% (weight/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA/PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature, and washed again three times in PBS. To permeabilize the cells, 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100/PBS (Amresco Inc., Solon, OH, USA) was applied to cells for 10 min at room temperature, after which the cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 1% (weight/vol) bovine serum albumin in PBS (BSA/PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding of primary antibodies. Following this, 30 \u03bcl of the appropriate primary antibody, diluted in 1% (weight/vol) bovine serum albumin/PBS was placed on each cover slip, and the cover slips incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cover slips were then washed three times at 15 min each with PBS and were incubated with 30 \u03bcl of the secondary antibody (Alexa goat anti-mouse IgG) diluted 1:2000 with 1% (weight/vol) bovine serum albumin/PBS, for 2 hours at room temperature. Cover slips were then washed three times for 5 min each with PBS, and stained with ethidium bromide (diluted 1:10,000 in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 to 4 min to visualize nuclei. A final series of three PBS washes of 5 min each was then performed, after which the cover slips were dried and mounted on 1.5 \u03bcl of Bio-Rad FluoroGuard\u2122 Anti-fade Reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and cover slip edges sealed with nail polish.For cells cultured on EHS gel, the filter was inverted and the membrane cut into six to eight segments using a razor. Segments were placed in 35 mm sterile Petri dishes and gently washed three times for 5 min each with PBS. The same procedure was followed for indirect immunocytochemistry, as previously described.MicroscopyCells were viewed using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, New South Wales, Australia), using oil immersion and a 40\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 objective. Images were captured by the photomultiplier tube using the Leica TCS SP2 laser, and viewed on a workstation using Leica microsystems TCS SP2 software. Images were presented using Microsoft PowerPoint software.ResultsCAFs demonstrate greater expression of myofibroblastic markers than NMFsThe phenotypes of human primary NMFs, obtained from reduction mammoplasty tissue, and human primary mammary CAFs, obtained from minced mammary tumour biopsy tissue, were determined by analysis of protein markers associated with the myofibroblast phenotype.Western blot analysis revealed that \u03b1-SMA (Figure 1a) was expressed by both NMFs and CAFs; however, densitometry revealed 2.7-fold higher expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs as compared with NMFs. A control sample derived from human immortalized skin fibroblasts (GM847) was negative for \u03b1-SMA expression (Figure 1a). Western blot analysis indicated that FAP was expressed by both NMFs and CAFs, but not by the GM847 control fibroblasts (Figure 1b). An increase in band density by twofold was seen for CAFs as compared with NMFs (Figure 1b).Fibroblasts cause changes in key myoepithelial- and luminal epithelial-specific protein expression by PMC42-LA organoidsPMC42-LA cells cultured on ECM gel coated filters to form organoids with fibroblasts beneath the filter or fibroblast-conditioned medium were analyzed for myoepithelial-specific and luminal epithelial-specific protein markers.Compared with control, expression of the luminal epithelial marker E-cadherin, as measured by Western blot analysis, was not significantly upregulated by PMC42-LA organoids cultured with either NMFs (fold increase: 1.8 \u00b1 1.17) or CAFs (fold increase: 1.8 \u00b1 1.31) beneath the filter (Figure 2a, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Similar values were seen when fibroblast-conditioned medium was used in place of the fibroblasts (fold increase compared with control: 1.5 \u00b1 2.13 with NMF-conditioned medium and 2.4 \u00b1 1.10 with CAF-conditioned medium; Figure 2a, lanes 3 and 4). Immunocytochemistry confirmed that E-cadherin was expressed by most cells in all conditions tested, with no obvious changes in the organization of E-cadherin expressing cells within organoid structures (Figure 2a, lanes 1 to 4).In the absence of fibroblasts or their conditioned medium, \u03b1-SMA was not expressed by PMC42-LA organoids (Figure 2b). When cultured with NMFs beneath the filter, PMC42-LA organoids exhibited a significant 2.5 (\u00b1 1.16)-fold increase in \u03b1-SMA (P < 0.01), similar to that seen in PMC42-LA cultures with CAFs beneath the filter (fold increase: 2.7 \u00b1 0.42, P < 0.01; Figure 2b, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Compared with control, conditioned medium from NMFs caused a significant 6.7 (\u00b1 2.76)-fold increase in \u03b1-SMA expression (P < 0.01) in PMC42-LA cells, which was similar to the significant 7.4 (\u00b1 1.20)-fold increase seen in PMC42-LA cells (P < 0.001) cultured in CAF-conditioned medium (Figure 2b, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Immunocytochemistry revealed that \u03b1-SMA-expressing cells were organized similarly within organoids in all fibroblast treatment conditions (Figure 2b, lanes 1 to 4).Cytokeratin 14 was not expressed by PMC42-LA organoids in the absence of fibroblasts/conditioned medium (Figure 2c). However, expression of cytokeratin 14 was induced significantly by the presence of either NMFs (fold increase: 11.5 \u00b1 9.1, P < 0.01) or CAFs (fold increase: 12.3 \u00b1 9.3, P < 0.01) beneath the filter (Figure 2c, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Fibroblast-conditioned medium induced expression of cytokeratin 14 similarly, with a significant 10.9 (\u00b1 8.8)-fold increase by PMC42-LA in NMF-conditioned medium (P < 0.01), and a 14.4 (\u00b1 10.2)-fold increase by cells in CAF-conditioned medium (P < 0.01; Figure 2c, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Immunocytochemistry confirmed no obvious changes in the organization of cytokeratin 14-expressing cells within organoids in all fibroblast treatment conditions (Figure 2c, lanes 1 to 4).Fibroblasts induce upregulation of vimentin and a change in the orientation of vimentin-positive cells in PMC42-LA organoidsCompared with control, vimentin expression was significantly increased in cells cultured with NMFs beneath the filter (fold increase: 3.9 \u00b1 2.50, P < 0.001) and in cells with CAFs beneath the filter (fold increase: 4.4 \u00b1 2.70, P < 0.001; Figure 2d, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). In the presence of NMF-conditioned medium, vimentin expression was significantly upregulated by 3.2 (\u00b1 1.30)-fold (P < 0.001), which was similar to the 3.3 (\u00b1 1.80)-fold (P < 0.001) increase by cells in CAF-conditioned medium (Figure 2d, lanes 3 and 4, respectively) compared with control. In control PMC42-LA organoids, vimentin-positive cells were distributed throughout the organoids with no apparent pattern in organization (Figure 2d, control). However, when cells were cultured with NMFs beneath the filter, vimentin-positive cells became more organized, and were only visible on the outer layer of organoids (Figure 2d, lane 1). This was also the case when cells were cultured with CAFs beneath the filter (Figure 2d, lane 2) and in NMF-conditioned medium (Figure 2d, lane 3). Surprisingly, PMC42-LA cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium appeared to form organoids with the same organization as control cells, with vimentin-positive cells being dispersed throughout organoids (Figure 2d, lane 4).Fibroblasts induce an intracellular change in localisation of E-cadherin in PMC42-LA cells away from the cell junctionsIn the absence of fibroblast influences, E-cadherin appeared to have a junctional localization in PMC42-LA cells (Figure 3a part A, left and right panels). The presence of either NMFs or CAFs beneath the filter, or their respective conditioned media, induced a change in E-cadherin localization from cell-cell junctions (Figure 3a part A, left and right panels) to cytoplasm, where it adopted a granular distribution (Figure 3a parts B to E). To better visualize this change in localization within individual cells and obtain sections through cells, PMC42-LA monolayers cultured in fibroblast conditioned medium were also immunostained for E-cadherin; confocal sections through these cells clearly demonstrate some junctional and granular cytoplasmic localization in cells cultured in NMF conditioned medium (Figure 3a part B, right panel). Significantly, the E-cadherin localization appeared more cytoplasmic in PMC42-LA cells in the presence of CAF-conditioned medium (Figure 3a part C, right panel).CAF-conditioned medium causes disruption of the cadherin-catenin complex in PMC42-LA cellsIn the absence of fibroblast-conditioned media, E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin colocalized to the cell junctions in PMC42-LA monolayer cells (yellow in Figure 3b part A), with sparse areas of independent localization (red/green). When PMC42-LA cells were cultured in NMF-conditioned medium, this colocalization was still apparent (yellow in Figure 3b part B), with some areas of non-colocalization (green/red). However, in the presence of CAF-conditioned medium, \u03b2-catenin exhibited a predominantly cytoplasmic label, with some nuclear label (red in Figure 3b part C), with E-cadherin also localised to the cytoplasm (green/yellow in Figure 3b part C). This was performed on PMC42-LA monolayer cultures to allow one to visualize clearly the localization of these two proteins within individual cells.CAFs may stimulate more rapid proliferation of PMC42-LA cells than NMFsUsing total cell counts at 24 hours, 3 days and 5 days, some differences in rates of proliferation of PMC42-LA cells in relation to fibroblast-conditioned medium were seen (data not shown). No significant difference was detected at 24 hours, but at 3 days numbers of PMC42-LA cells in CAF-conditioned medium were considerably greater than numbers of PMC42-LA cells cultured in NMF-conditioned medium. At 5 days, this difference was still evident although not significant. This pattern was also seen in three-dimensional culture, with no difference in PMC42-LA proliferation in NMF-conditioned media or CAF-conditioned media at 24 hours; considerably higher cell numbers in CAF-conditioned media at 3 days; and slightly higher, but not significant, proliferation of PMC42-LA in CAF-conditioned medium at 5 days compared with NMF-conditioned medium (data not shown).Effects of CAFs and NMFs on cell viability and apoptosis of PMC42-LA cells do not differNo differences were seen in viability of PMC42-LA cell cultures in the presence of NMFs or CAFs at 24 hours, 3 days and 5 days (Figure 4a), as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion (viable cells calculated as a percentage of total cells counted). Western blot analysis for active caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, revealed no differences in expression levels for PMC42-LA cells cultured with NMFs beneath the filter as compared with CAFs beneath the filter (densitometry ratio 1:1.2), or in cells cultured in NMF-conditioned medium as compared with those in CAF-conditioned medium (densitometry ratio 1:1.4; Figure 4b).CAF-conditioned medium enhances the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cellsPMC42-LA cells were cultured on glass to enable the scratch removal of cells and the measurement of wound closure over a period of 48 hours. In the presence of NMF-conditioned medium, PMC42-LA cell wound closure was similar to that in control medium after 48 hours (Figure 5 panels d to f versus panels a to c). Cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium exhibited rapid wound closure, with most wounds being completely closed by 48 hours (Figure 5 panels g, h and i part ii), visible only by the areas of intense vimentin label among areas of less label (Figure 5i part ii). When the widths of the wounds were measured and averaged, control cells had wounds of approximately 367 \u00b1 29 \u03bcm at 0 hours, 188 \u00b1 21 \u03bcm at 24 hours and 81 \u00b1 29 \u03bcm at 48 hours. Cells in NMF-conditioned medium had wounds of approximately 383 \u00b1 38 \u03bcm at 0 hours, 213 \u00b1 33 \u03bcm at 24 hours and 52 \u00b1 16 \u03bcm at 48 hours, and cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium had wounds of approximately 392 \u00b1 52 \u03bcm at 0 hours, 58 \u00b1 52 \u03bcm at 24 hours and 17 \u00b1 29 \u03bcm at 48 hours (Figure 5j). Vimentin expression in control cells did not appear changed at 24 hours and was not increased until 48 hours after wound infliction (Figure 5c), whereas cells cultured in the presence of NMF-conditioned medium exhibited a slight increase in vimentin expression by 24 hours (Figure 5e). Cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium appeared to express more vimentin at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 5h and 5i part i), as compared with control cells and cells cultured in NMF-conditioned medium. In addition to this, some cells in CAF-conditioned medium cultures exhibited an elongated/spindle shape, with some detached cells, neither of which were seen in control or NMF cultures (Figure 5h and 5i part ii).Concentration of NMF-conditioned media enhances the migratory ability of PMC42-LAPMC42-LA cells were cultured on glass to enable the scratch removal of cells and the measurement of wound closure 24 hours after scratch. In the presence of NMF-conditioned medium at a 1\u00d7 concentration/control, PMC42-LA cell wounds at 24 hours averaged 307 \u00b1 24.29 \u03bcm (Figure 6a). Cells cultured in a 2\u00d7 NMF-conditioned medium had an average wound width of 319 \u00b1 23.15 \u03bcm (Figure 6b) at 24 hours. Cells cultured in a 4\u00d7 NMF-conditioned medium had wounds of 232 \u00b1 49.65 \u03bcm (Figure 6c) at 24 hours and cells cultured in a 10\u00d7 NMF-conditioned medium had wounds of 160 \u00b1 62.43 \u03bcm (Figure 6d) 24 hours post-scratch. Vimentin localization did not appear changed in any of the concentrated media compared with control, but PMC42-LA cells cultured in 10\u00d7 NMF-conditioned medium cultures exhibited an elongated/spindle shape, with some detached cells, neither of which were seen in the less concentrated NMF-conditioned media cultures (Figure 6d versus a to c). Average wound widths of these cultures are displayed graphically (Figure 6e).CAF-conditioned medium causes budding and detachment of single cells from PMC42-LA organoids in three-dimensional cultureWhen cultured in control three dimensional-culture, PMC42-LA cells formed round organoids, with few or no single cells present in the culture (Figure 7a,b). When cultured in three-dimensional culture with CAF-conditioned medium, PMC42-LA organoids remained predominantly spherical, although the appearance of some budding edges on organoids and the presence of some single cells in the cultures were noted (Figure 7c,d). Furthermore, when PMC42-LA cells were grown in three dimensional culture with CAF-conditioned medium placed as a chemoattractant beneath the filter insert, organoids once again exhibitied budding edges, in addition to many single cells and clusters of single cells present among the organoids (Figure 7e,f).DiscussionIn our study we used a human mammary carcinoma cell line with stem cell-like properties  in vitro to illustrate the differential effects of NMFs and CAFs on EMT. Darcy and coworkers used a similar transwell co-culture system to show that mammary fibroblasts beneath the filter insert were able to stimulate mammary epithelial cell growth and induce alveolar morphogenesis. A similar study conducted by Gache and colleagues also demonstrated that the effect of fibroblasts on co-cultured epithelial cells is via paracrine exchange mechanisms. We extended this approach to compare the effects of fibroblasts derived from malignant mammary tissue (CAFs) with those derived from normal mammary tissue (NMFs). To our knowledge, this is a novel report of selective and direct effects of CAFs on EMT parameters.NMFs and CAFs can be distinguished on the basis of their differential maker expression. FAP is a 93 kDa cell surface antigen of reactive tumour stromal fibroblasts that is not detected by immunocytochemistry in normal fibroblasts. Expression of FAP was seen in both NMFs and CAFs but at a higher level (approximately twofold) in CAFs. To date, there have been no quantitative data published on FAP expression, only studies indicating that resting fibroblasts in normal tissue lack detectable FAP expression by immunocytochemistry. This suggests that a low FAP level, undetectable by immunocytochemistry, may be expressed by NMFs and detectable only by Western blot analysis. We detected higher levels of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs than in NMFs, confirming the myofibroblastic nature of CAFs. The NMFs used in this study exhibit some \u03b1-SMA expression, despite being derived from normal human mammary tissue and, expectedly, the CAFs displayed higher expression (2.7-fold) of this protein. It has been shown that 10% to 80% of cultured human mammary stromal cells synthesize \u03b1-SMA after 4 to 11 days in culture, suggesting that elements of smooth muscle differentiation may arise during cell culture of non-smooth-muscle stromal cells that have been taken directly from human breast tissue. Therefore the expression of some \u03b1-SMA by NMFs may be an artefact of culture conditions and is not entirely unexpected.The most significant observation of this study was the differential effects of NMFs and CAFs on the migration of PMC42-LA cells, directly implicating a role for CAFs in inducing cell motility. Following wound infliction in two-dimensional culture, CAF-conditioned medium caused PMC42-LA cells to migrate and upregulate vimentin at the site of the wound at a quicker rate than was seen in control cells or in cells cultured in medium conditioned by NMFs. Wounded control PMC42-LA cells were accompanied by very little vimentin upregulation and incomplete wound closure over 48 hours, similar to PMC42-LA cells cultured in NMF-conditioned medium. The monolayer of control and NMF-conditioned medium cultures remained intact, with no detached cells or changes in cell morphology. In contrast, within 24 hours, PMC42-LA cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium exhibited a dramatic upregulation of vimentin, with small numbers of detached 'stray' cells. In CAF-conditioned medium, at 24 hours, stray PMC42-LA cells and cells surrounding the wound possessed a spindle-shaped morphology, with some cells exhibiting vimentin-rich protrusions. By 48 hours, almost all PMC42-LA wounds in CAF-conditioned medium were completely closed and could only be visualized by reference to areas of intense vimentin staining and cells with an elongated morphology, stretching in the direction of wound closure. The addition of CAF-conditioned medium to three-dimensional PMC42-LA organoid cultures or below the filters caused 'budding' on some organoids, and the appearance of stray cells and clusters of stray cells surrounding the organoids, which were not seen in control cultures.These findings, combined with the apparent loss in cell-cell adhesion and upregulation of vimentin, suggest that PMC42-LA are more susceptible to EMT in the presence of CAFs. A slight increase in PMC42-LA migration was noted in NMF-conditioned media cultures compared with control, although to a lesser extent than in CAF-conditioned media, indicating that a factor, or factors, secreted by NMFs may be more highly secreted by CAFs. This was confirmed by experiments evaluating the effect of increasing the concentration of NMF-conditioned medium; specifically, we report a concentration-dependant response by PMC42-LA, with more extensive scratch wound closure in more concentrated NMF-conditioned media.A key finding in our study was the disruptive effect of CAF-conditioned media on cell-cell junctions. Exposure of PMC42-LA organoids to either NMFs or CAFs caused a change in localization of E-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule that is normally located at cell junctions. E-cadherin has been shown to be an invasion suppressor in cell culture systems, and partial or complete loss of E-cadherin expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. E-cadherin was detected mainly in the cytoplasm of PMC42-LA cells after exposure to either type of fibroblast or fibroblast-conditioned medium, and this cytoplasmic localization was more pronounced in PMC42-LA cells cultured in the presence of CAFs than in the presence of NMFs. An abnormal cytoplasmic distribution of E-cadherin has been reported in 17% of invasive lobular breast tumours, with variable expression on cell membranes. The in vitro movement of E-cadherin from cell junctions to the cytoplasm has been reported as a consequence of EMT in vitro . To our knowledge, these data provide the first evidence that myofibroblasts can induce an EMT in mammary carcinoma cells.The loss of cellular junctional integrity was confirmed by observations that CAF-conditioned medium induced mis-localization of \u03b2-catenin to cytoplasm and nuclear regions in PMC42-LA cells. \u03b2-Catenin is an essential component of junctional complexes, linking E-cadherin to the actin filaments. Mouse studies of colorectal cancer have described increased cytoplasmic expression and nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin in chemically induced tumours. E-cadherin has also been shown to recruit \u03b2-catenin to the cell membrane and prevent its nuclear localization in SW480 colon carcinoma cells. Plasma membrane-associated staining of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin has reportedly been absent in invasive lobular carcinomas of the breast. Accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus has been hypothesized to promote malignant transformation and progression in breast cancer. Thus the CAF-conditioned medium induced mis-localization of \u03b2-catenin seen in our study indicates a substantial role for CAFs in EMT and potentially a role in cancer progression.Further evidence of an EMT is the upregulation of vimentin by PMC42-LA cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium. Induction of vimentin is a hallmark of EMT, with almost universal upregulation of this protein. Vimentin is selectively expressed in invasive human breast cancer cell lines, reflecting the end-stage of tumour de-differentiation. Vimentin is a marker for the mesenchymal phenotype, and upregulation of vimentin may be indicative of EMT. Increased expression of vimentin has previously been reported in PMC42-LA cells in response to EGF-induced EMT. Significantly, although the presence of NMFs resulted in the appearance of vimentin-positive cells layered on the outside of organoids, in control organoids and cells cultured in CAF-conditioned medium vimentin-positive cells were localized throughout the organoids.We postulate that NMFs secrete factors that lead to cellular organization or, conversely, that soluble secreted factors from CAFs disturb cell disorganization. It is possible that that this disorganization was not seen in PMC42-LA cells cultured with CAFs beneath the filter because of insufficient concentrations of these factor(s) being produced by the small number of fibroblasts placed below the filter. A similar loss of polarity and disruption of acinar structures has been reported in three-dimensional HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cell culture, associated with FGF receptor 1 activation. This cellular disorganization was also accompanied by a gain of invasive properties and increased vimentin expression. A hallmark of breast cancer is a loss of polarity and apico-basal organization of epithelial cells, and our results indicate that fibroblasts may have the capacity to alter the organization of epithelial cells within a three-dimensional structure.Vimentin is not only a marker of EMT but also a marker specific to myoepithelial cells, and therefore upregulation in this protein alone does not suggest EMT. The possibility that CAF-conditioned medium induces a myoepithelial phenotype rather than an EMT can be excluded by the knowledge that both NMFs and CAFs induce these myoepithelial markers, but only CAFs are able to induce migration of PMC42-LA. In addition to an upregulation of vimentin, it is also the separation of cells from the epithelial 'sheets' and a morphologic change to spindle cells that characterises an EMT, all of which we report here. In vitro studies have shown that soluble factors such as EGF, motility factors and scatter factors promote migratory and locomotive abilities in epithelial cells, accompanied by changes in cell morphology, thereby promoting an EMT. However, although these factors induce an EMT in vitro, no specific in vivo counterparts for these growth factors in cancer progression have been found. Our study demonstrates a novel model that mimics the in vivo mammary gland, whereby myofibroblasts, through soluble factors, induce breast epithelial cells to undergo an EMT.In contrast to other studies demonstrating a substantial effect of fibroblasts and fibroblast-conditioned medium in stimulating proliferation of cells through paracrine mechanisms, in our studies we report only a slight increase in proliferation of PMC42-LA in CAF-conditioned medium compared with NMF-conditioned medium. Over a 5-day period, we report no significant difference in the effect of CAFs compared with NMFs on cell viability or programmed cell death. Other studies have also reported that conditioned medium obtained from fibroblasts derived from both malignant and benign breast tumours had growth stimulatory effects on breast cancer cells, whereas conditioned medium from normal fibroblasts inhibited growth. The extent of proliferation induced may depend upon the source of the fibroblasts, with tumour fibroblasts producing a greater mitogenic response than fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissue. In vitro studies using mammary fibroblasts and in vivo mouse studies using CAFs and NMFs indicate that the effect of fibroblasts on tumour cells depends upon the type and proportion of inoculated cells. Our study indicates that the key effects of CAFs are on motility, cell organization and EMT marker expression, rather than proliferation.To ascertain how NMFs and CAFs differentially affect breast epithelial cells, we analyzed PMC42-LA cultured in their conditioned medium for a range of markers. Expression of the myoepithelial marker proteins \u03b1-SMA and cytokeratin 14 were significantly upregulated by PMC42-LA organoids upon exposure to both fibroblast types and their respective conditioned medium. Although unrelated to a cancer or EMT phenotype, we previously demonstrated upregulation in myoepithelial-specific proteins by PMC42-LA cells cultured in three dimensions with primary mammary fibroblasts. In the present study, no significant difference in expression levels of myoepithelial proteins was caused by exposure to the different fibroblasts, indicating that both CAFs and NMFs can enrich the myoepithelial population in PMC42-LA culture. A significantly greater increase in \u03b1-SMA was seen in cells cultured in either type of fibroblast-conditioned medium, as compared with those with fibroblasts beneath the filter. This may be attributed to the possibility that a greater concentration of fibroblast-secreted soluble factors may be present in fibroblast-conditioned medium, as compared with the less concentrated factors that would be secreted from the small number of fibroblasts beneath the filter.Arising from the study is the question of the nature of the soluble factors that mediate the differential effects of CAFs and NMFs on mammary epithelial cells. van Roozendaal and coworkers reported that breast fibroblast-conditioned medium contains IGF, which was responsible for MCF-7 proliferation. However, when NMFs and CAFs were compared in terms of IGF-II expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction, no significant difference was seen. Neutralizing antibodies specific to growth factors demonstrated that the growth-stimulatory activity of fibroblasts was not inhibited by anti-IGF-II, anti-EGF, anti-IGF, or anti-TGF-\u03b1. Because fibroblasts produce many other growth factors, such as various factors from the hepatocyte growth factor, and basic FGF and IGF families, there are many possibilities and combinations of growth factors that may be responsible for the effect of fibroblasts. Treatments of PMC42-LA cells with IGF-I (10 ng/ml) and IGF-II (10 ng/ml), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (40 ng/ml), vascular endothelial growth factor (10 ng/ml) and TGF-\u03b2 (10 ng/ml) failed to replicate the upregulation of vimentin and mis-localization of E-cadherin (data not shown) we found with CAF-conditioned media exposure. Further analysis of the fibroblast-conditioned media is necessary to identify the factors involved; furthermore, the reciprocal effect of cancer cells on the production of growth factors by fibroblasts may need to be taken into account.ConclusionOur study demonstrates a direct role for CAFs in breast cancer progression through the induction of an EMT. Relative to NMFs, CAFs had increased propensity to increase the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells, commensurate with the characteristics of EMT, including the mis-localization of E-cadherin and translocation of \u03b2-catenin, and the upregulation of vimentin. Our study indicates that the factor or factors responsible are secreted by CAFs at a higher level than by NMFs. Elucidation of the mechanism of the cellular interaction between CAFs and mammary epithelial cells will contribute to preventative treatments of breast carcinoma metastasis that act by targeting these factors directly.AbbreviationsCAF = cancer-associated fibroblast; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; ECM = extracellular matrix; EGF = epidermal growth factor; EHS = Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma; EMT = epithelial-mesenchymal transition; FAP = fibroblast activation protein; FBS = foetal bovine serum; FGF = fibroblast growth factor; IGF = insulin-like growth factor; NMF = normal mammary fibroblast; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; SMA = smooth muscle actin; TBS = Tris-buffered saline; TGF = transforming growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsSCL carried out all experimental studies; MLA and SCL conceived the study.

(a) No \u03b1-SMA detected in control GM847 skin fibroblasts (lane 1), but \u03b1-SMA was detected in NMFs (lane 2) and in CAFs (lane 3), with an average 2.7-fold increase in band densities for CAFs compared to NMFs. (b) FAP was expressed by both NMFs and CAFs (lanes 2 and 3, respectively), but it was not detected in control GM847 skin fibroblasts (lane 1). An average 2-fold increase in band density for CAFs, compared with NMFs, was observed.

Western blot analysis for a range of markers on control PMC42-LA organoids (control), and organoids cultured with NMFs beneath the filter (lane 1), with CAFs beneath the filter (lane 2), in medium conditioned by NMFs (lane 3), or in medium conditioned by CAFs (lane 4). Controls had no fibroblasts or fibroblast conditioned-medium. Immunocytochemistry was performed to view organization within organoid structures, and ethidium bromide was used to stain nuclei (red). (a) E-cadherin was not significantly upregulated in any of the fibroblast conditions, with no obvious changes in organization. (b) \u03b1-SMA expression was found to be significantly upregulated by all fibroblast conditions, with no obvious changes in organization. (c) Cytokeratin 14 expression was found to be significantly induced by all fibroblast conditions, with no obvious changes in organization. (d) Vimentin expression was also found to be significantly upregulated in all fibroblast conditions, with slight changes in organoid organization detected by immunocytochemistry. In control PMC42-LA cells (control lane in panel d), intermediate filament protein vimentin is localized in the cytoplasm of cells throughout organoids. With NMFs beneath the filter (panel d lane 1), vimentin remains localized in the cytoplasm of PMC42-LA cells and vimentin-positive cells are more organized, visible only on outer layer of organoids. With CAFs beneath the filter (panel d lane 2), the same organizational changes are observed. With NMF-conditioned media (panel d lane 3), the same organizational changes are observed. With CAF-conditioned medium (panel d lane 4), no change in organization is observed, with vimentin expression throughout organoids.

(a) Using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, localization of E-cadherin was analyzed. Nuclei were visualized using ethidium bromide (red). (Part A) In control PMC42-LA organoids (no fibroblasts or conditioned media), E-cadherin staining was observed at cell junctions, which was confirmed by confocal microscopy sectioning of PMC42-LA in 2-dimensional culture (right panel). (Part B) In NMF-conditioned medium E-cadherin label was detected as both junctional and cytoplasmic in PMC42-LA organoids, as confirmed by confocal microscopy sectioning of PMC42-LA in 2-dimensional culture containing NMF-conditioned media (right panel). (Part C) In CAF-conditioned media E-cadherin was also detected as junctional and cytoplasmic in PMC42-LA organoids, with more predominant cytoplasmic localization. This was confirmed in 2-dimensional PMC42-LA culture containing CAF-conditioned media by confocal microscopy sectioning (right panel). With (part D) NMFs beneath filter or (part E) CAFs beneath the filter, E-cadherin was again detected at cell junctions and within cytoplasm. (b) E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin are indicated by green and red label, respectively. Areas of colocalization appear yellow. (Part A) In control PMC42-LA cells (no fibroblasts or conditioned media), E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin colocalized at cell junctions with some areas of non-colocalization. (Part B) When in NMF-conditioned medium, colocalization was detected at cell junctions with some independent localization. (Part C) In CAF-conditioned medium, E-cadherin localized to cytoplasm and \u03b2-catenin to cytoplasm and nuclei, with some overlap. CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; NMF, normal mammary fibroblast.Effect of fibroblast conditioned on apoptosis and cell viability. For PMC42-LA cells cultured in fibroblast-conditioned medium, trypan blue dye exclusion was used to analyze cell viability, and total number of cells were counted and averaged to determine the average percentage of viable cells. (a) There was a slight variation in cell viability at 24 hours (75\u2013100% viable cells [average 91.67 \u00b1 14.43% in NMF-conditioned medium] and 85\u2013100% [91.90 \u00b1 7.33%] in CAF-conditioned medium). Similar cell viability was observed at 3 days (97\u2013100% [99.21 \u00b1 1.37%] in NMF-conditioned medium and 98\u2013100% [average 99.40 \u00b1 1.05%] in CAF-conditioned medium). There was no difference at 5 days (97\u201398% [98.48 \u00b1 0.69%] in NMF-conditioned medium and 97\u2013100% [98.93 \u00b1 1.13%] in CAF-conditioned medium). (b) There was no significant difference in active caspase-3 expression between cultures. CAF, cancer-associated fibroblast; NMF, normal mammary fibroblast.Effect of different fibroblast-conditioned media on cell migration in two-dimensional cultures. PMC42-LA cells were cultured on glass in either normal medium (control), NMF-conditioned medium, or CAF-conditioned medium. Using scratch tests, over a period of 48 hours, PMC42-LA cells were analyzed to determine the rate and extent of wound closure, and vimentin expression. Four scratches averaging between 367 \u03bcm (minimum) and 392 \u03bcm (maximum) in width were made at time 0. Scratches were measured and averaged, and the extent of wound closure calculated and averaged. (a-c) Cells in normal medium (control) exhibited some wound closure at 24 hours (179 \u00b1 21.4 \u03bcm), and this had progressed by 48 hours (106 \u00b1 29.0 \u03bcm) with small, sparing vimentin expression appearing at 48 hours. (d-f) Cells in NMF-conditioned medium exhibited similar rates of wound closure at 24 hours (171 \u00b1 32.9 \u03bcm) and 48 hours (160 \u00b1 15.6 \u03bcm), with vimentin expression appearing at wound edges at 24 hours. (g-i) Cells in CAF-conditioned medium exhibited an accelerated wound closure rate, with the width of scratches reduced by 24 hours (333 \u00b1 52.0 \u03bcm) and almost full wound closure by 48 hours (panel i part i: 41.63 \u00b1 28.8 \u03bcm). Vimentin expression in these cells was abundant around wound area. (Panel i part ii) Closed wounds were identified at 48 hours by visualizing areas of elongated, vimentin-profuse cells in apparently normal areas of lesser vimentin expression.

PMC42-LA cells were cultured on glass in 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7, or 10\u00d7 NMF-conditioned medium. Using scratch tests, PMC42-LA cells were analyzed for the extent of wound closure 24 hours after scratch. Scratches were measured and averaged, and the extent of wound closure calculated and averaged. (a) Cells in 1\u00d7 NMF-conditioned media (control) had average wound sizes of 307 \u00b1 24.3 \u03bcm 24 hours post-scratch.

The specific immunohistochemical characteristics of the stromal component according to the breast carcinoma subtype surrogates of molecular classes is poorly understood. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which is one of the most important proteins considered to facilitate tumor invasion, in a series of invasive breast carcinomas according to subtype: Luminal A, luminal B, luminal-HER2, HER2-enriched and triple-negative. A significant increase in MMP2 expression was demonstrated in tumors known to exhibit a more aggressive metastatic behavior, such as luminal HER2 (37%), HER2-enriched (30%) and triple-negative tumors (17%), compared with the luminal A (6%) or luminal B (13%) subtypes.

        "content": "Tumor stroma has been recently shown to play a crucial role in the development of breast cancer. Since the origin of the stromal cells in the tumor is unknown, we have examined differences and similarities between three stromal cell types of mesenchymal origin, namely carcinoma associated fibroblasts from breast tumor (CAFs), fibroblasts from normal breast area (NFs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In a microarray analysis, immunological, developmental and extracellular matrix -related pathways were over-represented in CAFs when compared to NFs (p&lt;0.001). Under hypoxic conditions, the expression levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) were lower in CAFs when compared to NFs (fold changes 0.6 and 0.4, respectively). In normoxia, when compared to NFs, CAFs displayed increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and PDK1 (fold changes 1.5 and 1.3, respectively). With respect to the assessed surface markers, only CD105 was expressed differently in MSCs when compared to fibroblasts, being more often expressed on MSCs. Cells with myofibroblast features were present in both NF and CAF samples. We conclude, that CAFs differ distinctly from NFs at the gene expression level, this hypothesis was also tested in silico for other available gene expression data.",

BC is typically an extremely heterogeneous disease with high inter- and intra-tumor variabilities, which complicates diagnostics/prognostics as well as personalized therapy. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) continues to be a serious health problem with adverse outcome despite all the revolutionary advancements made in cancer therapy and the introduction of precision medicine. However, the prognostic of this aggressive form of BC has been improved through the introduction of some biological characteristics, which allow to choose the most suitable systemic treatments.In addition to the heterogeneous composition of breast cancer, tumor cells are part of a very complex and dynamic ecosystem composed of various types of cells, hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix and other factors. Several lines of evidence indicate the presence of various cooperative signaling loops between cancer cells and their adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which influence the evolution and therapeutic response of cancer. Thereby, it has become clear that CAFs and their biomarkers could be of great predictive/prognostic value. In this direction, we have recently shown that the RNA-binding protein AUF1 (also called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, hnRNPD) plays a major role in the activation and the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts. In addition, AUF1 can promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as well as stemness in mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, we sought to investigate here the potential use of the AUF1 expression level in breast cancer cells and their adjacent CAFs as prognostic tool for patients suffering LABC. The present findings present clear evidence that AUF1 expression level in breast CAFs has prognostic values for breast cancer patients, especially those diagnosed as TNBC. Furthermore, neoadjuvant therapy-dependent downregulation of AUF1 to a low level in tumor cells was shown to be associated with better survival. Additionally, we have shown that BSFs that express high level of AUF1 promote carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in a paracrine manner.MethodsCells and cell cultureBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and used as previously described. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased in 2011 from ATCC and were authenticated using short tandem repeat profiling by ATCC, propagated, expanded and frozen immediately into numerous aliquots after arrival. The revived cells were utilized within 10 to 12 passages and not exceeding a period of 3\u00a0months and were cultured following the instructions of the company. Cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kits (Lonza). All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotic and antimycotic solutions, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. The anti-AUF1 antibody (07-260) was purchased from Millipore. Antibodies directed against Twist1 (10E4E6), IL-6, Snail (C15D3) were purchased from Abcam. ALDH1/2 (H-85), CD24 (C-20) and GAPDH (FL-335) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (USA). E-cadherin (24E10), N-cadherin, OCT4 (C30A3), Sox2 (D6D9), STAT3 (124H6), p-STAT3 (Tyr705), KLF-4 (D1F2), cleaved PARP (Asp214), cleaved caspase-9 (Asp315), cyclinD1 (DCS6) and EpCAM (D1B3) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA). CD44 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-ZEB1 was purchased from Abnova and anti-vimentin from Abcam. ALDH1 was purchased from BD biosciences. All of these antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody (6708-11) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assaysThese assays were performed in a label-free real-time setting using the xCELLigence RTCA technology (Roche, Germany) that measures impedance changes in a meshwork of interdigitated gold microelectrodes located at the well bottom (E-plate) or at the bottom side of a microporous membrane (CIM-plate 16). Cell migration and invasion were assessed as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM-plate coated with a thin layer of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) basement membrane diluted 1:20 in serum-free medium (invasion) or non-coated (migration). Complete medium was used as a chemo-attractant in the lower chambers. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24\u00a0h and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as Cell Index (CI) value, which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate.For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were seeded in E-plate with complete medium as per the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Cell proliferation was assessed for 48\u00a0h. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell Index was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by background value, which represents cell status. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate.Spheroid formationCells were seeded in 96-well ultra-low attachment plate at density of 1000 viable cells/well. Cells were cultured in 171 medium supplemented with 1% ABM, 2% B-27, 20\u00a0ng/ml EGF, 500\u00a0ng/ml HC, 4% FBS and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin. Cells were incubated for 10\u00a0days at 37\u00a0\u00b0C under 5% CO2. Mammospheres with diameter of\u2009\u2265\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcm were counted using OPTIKA light microscope. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate.Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24\u00a0h, and then, media were collected and briefly centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C until needed.Immunoadsorption of cytokine/antibody complex from SFCMIL-6 present in the serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) from TCF64-ORF cells was first inhibited by an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. IgG (R&D systems) was used as control. To deplete TCF64-ORF-SFCM from IL-6nAb as well as IL-6/IL-6nAb complex, A/G Sepharose (8\u00a0mg/ml) (BioVision) was added to SFCM and incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and filtered.Patients and archived clinical materialsFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained from the Pathology Department at KFSH&RC with institutional review board approval (RAC#2151051). The study cohort consisted of 344 patients (females) who were histologically diagnosed with unilateral locally advanced breast cancer (T2\u2009\u2265\u20094\u00a0cm, T3 or T4, N0\u2013N2, M0) of non-inflammatory nature. These patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus Trastuzumab when HER2 positive and definitive surgery and locoregional radiotherapy\u2009\u00b1\u2009hormonal therapy, as previously described. The enrolled patients were diagnosed between 2006 and 2013, with a median follow-up time of 52. 6\u00a0months. Written informed consent was not required, and a waiver was granted since samples were anonymized to the research team. Diagnosis of invasive breast cancer was done through true-cut needle biopsy. Immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment biopsy was used to determine estrogen (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and HER2.Immunohistochemistry staining on FFPE tissuesImmunohistochemistry for AUF1 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using anti-AUF1 antibody from Abcam (ab50692) overnight at a dilution of 1:500, and slides were stained using automated staining platform (Ventana). Envision\u2009+\u2009polymer (ready to use; Dako) was used as a secondary antibody. Color was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and instant hematoxylin (Shandon) was used for counterstaining. The AUF1 level was evaluated and verified by two qualified pathologists, who scored both the proportion of positive cells and the intensity of AUF1 expression in both cancer cells and their stromal fibroblasts, and an immunoreactivity score was determined and used for statistical analysis.Flow cytometryCells (2.105) were treated and then stained with CD44/CD24 as previously described. Briefly, cells were washed and incubated with CD44 Pacific-Blue (from Invitrogen, USA) and CD24 PE (from BD Biosciences, USA) antibodies for surface staining (30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). Data were acquired using the LSR II flow cytometer and the BD FACSDiva operating software. Positive staining was considered based on the negativity of an isotype control. A minimum of 10,000 events was recorded for all samples.Cytotoxicity assay5000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates with appropriate culture media. After cells treatment, WST1 reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's instructions. These experiments were performed in triplicates and were repeated several times.Orthotopic tumor xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH&RC institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Ten female nude mice were randomized into 2 groups, and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) with TCF64-ORF or TCF64-CTRL cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumor size was measured with a caliper using the following formula (Length X Width X Height).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by the software package SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Continuous variables were compared by Student\u2019s t test, and P values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant. Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used in survival tables and curves, and the different subgroups were compared by the log-rank test.ResultsCorrelation of AUF1 expression in cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts with clinicopathological parametersIn the present study, we investigated the value of AUF1 expression level in both cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts as predictive biomarker for clinical outcome of LABC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy\u2009\u00b1\u2009Trastuzumab. The clinicopathological features of the enrolled patients (n\u2009=\u2009344) are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1. ER+/Her2+ patients (136) represented 39.5%, and ER+/Her2\u2212 (57) represented 16.5%, ER\u2212/Her+ (78) represented 22.6%, while ER\u2212/Her2\u2212 (73) represented 21.4%. Remarkably, most of the patients (73.84%) were less than 50\u00a0years old, and the same proportion had high tumor stage, while about 43% of the tumors were of grade 3. Great proportion of patients have developed recurrence (41%) and 74 succumbed to their disease (Additional file 1: Table S1). Notably, most tumors were of big size with T2 and T3 representing 76% (Additional file 1: Table S1).High AUF1 level in LABC tumors is associated with poor survival. A Tissue sections cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumors (different subtypes) were immunostained with an anti-AUF1 antibody. The photographs were obtained using the light microscope Olympus BX53 (Envision 60x). Scale bar\u2009=\u200950\u00a0\u03bcm.

AUF1 immunostaining was assessed in breast cancer tissues in both epithelium and stroma (Fig.\u00a01A). The level AUF1 immunostaining was classified into 2 subgroups: low (<\u200910% AUF1 negative cells) and high (\u2265\u200910%, AUF1-positive cells). Additional file 2: Table S2 shows that the AUF1 level was low or completely lost in 251/344 fibroblasts and 188/344 cancer cells, and high in 85/344 fibroblasts and 147/344 cancer cells. The analysis of AUF1 expression in the different subtypes showed correlation with ER/Her2. Indeed, high level of AUF1 in fibroblasts or cancer cells was significantly associated with lack of ER or Her2 (P\u2009=\u20090.0005 and P\u2009=\u20090.0296, respectively) (Additional file 2: Table S2). Table 1 shows no correlation between AUF1expression level in both CAFs and cancer cells and tumor size, tumor stage and tumor recurrence. However, high AUF1 expression in both types of cells was significantly associated with higher tumor grade (P\u2009=\u20090.021 (fibroblasts) and P\u2009=\u20090.0295 (cancer cells)) (Table 1).AUF1

patient\u2019s overall survival (OS) as well as disease-free survival (DFS) (Fig.\u00a01B). Indeed, patients with tumors expressing high levels of AUF1 in fibroblasts had significantly poorer OS and DFS (Fig.\u00a01B). However, patients with tumors expressing low AUF1 in CAFs showed better survival (P\u2009=\u20090.085 and P\u2009=\u20090.012, respectively) (Fig.\u00a01B). No correlation was observed between AUF1 expression level in cancer cells and patient\u2019s survival (Fig.\u00a01B). Univariate Cox regression analysis also showed an increased risk for patients with high AUF1 levels in stromal fibroblasts (P\u2009=\u20090.0151) but not in cancer cells (Table 2). Next, multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted and showed that the AUF1 expression level in stromal fibroblasts is a significant independent predictor of DFS and OS (P\u2009=\u20090.0249, P\u2009=\u20090.0315, respectively) (Table 3).Next, the AUF1 level was assessed in the 4 main breast cancer subtypes. Figure\u00a01C shows a significant correlation between fibroblast AUF1-positivity and poor OS of ER+/Her2\u2212 and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (P\u2009=\u20090.049 and P\u2009=\u20090.010, respectively). However, no correlation was observed with the other subtypes (Fig.\u00a01C). AUF1 positivity in cancer cells showed association with poor OS and DFS of ER+/Her2+ patients (P\u2009=\u20090.085 and P\u2009=\u20090.183) (Additional file 3: Fig. S1). Figure\u00a01C shows a very strong correlation between high fibroblast AUF1 level and poor DFS of the TNBC patients (P\u2009=\u20090.003). However, no correlation was observed with the other subtypes (Fig.\u00a01C).Neoadjuvant therapy-dependent downregulation of AUF1 in tumors improves patient outcomeNeoadjuvant therapy-dependent downregulation of AUF1 in tumors improves patient survival. Tissue sections cut from paired FFPE obtained pre-treatment and post-treatment were immunostained with an anti-AUF1 antibody.

Purple: AUF1 level down to\u2009<\u200910%, blue: AUF1 level not affected, green: AUF1 level up to\u2009\u2265\u200910%, brown: AUF1 level up/down but did not reach 10%Next, we sought to determine the effect of patient treatment on the expression of AUF1 in tumor and stromal cells. To this end, the expression of AUF1 was assessed on paired FFPE specimens collected pre- and post-treatment of each patient, for a total of 156 patients. The immunostaining results indicate downregulation, upregulation as well as no effect on the level of AUF1 in both cancer cells and their stromal adjacent fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a02A). Indeed, in cancer cells, AUF1 was downregulated in 46% cases and increased in only 20% cases, while 34% cases showed no change in AUF1 immunoreactivity (Additional file 4: Fig. S2). In fibroblasts, the AUF1 level decreased in only 22% cases and increased in 33% cases, while 45% cases showed no change in AUF1 immunoreactivity (Additional file 4: Fig. S2). This shows that for several patients, the effect of the treatment on AUF1 expression varies between cancer cells and their associated fibroblasts. Next, we investigated the effect of the neoadjuvant treatment on the expression of AUF1 among the tumors with high AUF1 immunoreactivity (\u2265\u200910%). Figure\u00a02B shows that while AUF1 downregulation (to a level\u2009<\u200910%) was highly significant in cancer cells (75%), it was not significant in fibroblasts (58.5%). This indicates that neoadjuvant therapy can reduce the AUF1 level (<\u200910%) in malignant cells in a significant number of tumors. This prompted us to test whether this AUF1 downregulation to a low level (<\u200910%) could affect patient survival. Kaplan\u2013Meier plots shown in Fig.\u00a02C indicate association between AUF1 downregulation in cancer cells and patient\u2019s disease-free survival (DFS) as well as overall survival (OS). Indeed, AUF1 downregulation to a low level (<\u200910%) improved the survival of the patients (Fig.\u00a02C). However, no association was observed between patient\u2019s survival and AUF1 downregulation in fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a02C).Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote carcinogenesisEctopic expression of AUF1 in BSFs promotes carcinogenesis in a paracrine manner. A TCF-64 cells were transfected with vectors either empty (TCF64-CTL) or bearing p37AUF1-ORF (TCF64-ORF). Whole cell lysates were prepared from these cells and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. B TCF64-CTL and TCF64-ORF cells were cultured in SFM for 24\u00a0h, and the respective SFCM (TCF64-CTL-SFCM and TCF64-ORF-SFCM) were collected and were used to treat the indicated BC cells for 24\u00a0h. Whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting analysis. The numbers below the bands represent fold change relative to the corresponding control after correction against the internal control, GAPDH. C Exponentially growing cells were added in SFM to the upper wells of the CIM plates either separated by a Matrigel basement membrane matrix (invasion) or without (migration), or E-plate (proliferation), and then, these capacities were assessed for the indicated periods of time using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System.

In order to elucidate the effect of AUF1 upregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts on breast carcinogenesis, we have first ectopically expressed AUF1 (p37) in normal breast fibroblasts (TCF64). TCF64 cells were infected with lentivirus-based vectors either empty (TCF64-CTL) or bearing the p37AUF1-ORF (TCF64-ORF). Figure\u00a03A shows upregulation of the 4 AUF1 isoforms in TCF64-ORF cells relative to controls. This could be mediated indirectly through the positive IL-6/STAT3 feedback loop. Next, TCF64-ORF and TCF64-CTL were cultured in serum-free medium for 24\u00a0h, and then, serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) were collected, TCF64-ORF-SFCM and TCF64-CTL-SFCM, respectively. The obtained SFCM were applied on two BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer cells) and MCF-7 (luminal breast cancer cells) for 24\u00a0h, and then, whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis. Figure\u00a03B shows downregulation of the epithelial markers (EpCAM and E-cadherin) and upregulation of the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Twist1 and Snail1) in BC cells that were exposed to TCF64-ORF-SFCM as compared to controls. This suggests that breast fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 can enhance the EMT process in BC cells in a paracrine manner. This was confirmed by showing a clear increase in the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities of these BC cells upon exposure to TCF64-ORF-SFCM (Fig.\u00a03C). These findings prompted us to explore the possible promotion of stemness in these BC cells. Indeed, the exposure of both BC cell lines to TCF64-ORF-SFCM downregulated CD24 while upregulated CD44 and ALDH1 as compared to controls (Fig.\u00a03B). Flow cytometric analysis showed TCF64-ORF-SFCM-dependent increase in the proportion of CD44high/CD24low subpopulation of cells in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines, as compared to their respective controls (Fig.\u00a03D). Furthermore, the number of the formed tumorspheres was higher in BC cells that were exposed to TCF64-ORF-SFCM than in their respective controls (Fig.\u00a03E). These results indicate that BSFs that express high level of AUF1 have the capacity to promote EMT and stemness, two pro-metastatic processes, in breast cancer cells both ER+ and ER\u2212.Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote carcinogenesis in an IL-6-dependent paracrine mannerEctopic expression of AUF1 in BSFs promotes carcinogenesis in an IL-6-dependent paracrine manner. A The indicated SFCM were applied onto human cytokine antibody array membranes (C7). B The indicated SFCM were used to assess the level of IL-6 by ELISA, and error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u2009=\u20093) (**P\u2009<\u20090.01).

D Cells were treated as indicated, and the migration and proliferation capacities were assessed for the indicated periods of time using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. E Cells (1000) were cultured in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates in the presence of specific stem cell medium. Left panel, representative images of mammospheres. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcm. Right panel, Graphs depicting the number of formed mammospheres. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u2009=\u20093) (*P\u2009<\u20090.05)Next, we decided to determine the main factor responsible for the paracrine pro-carcinogenic promotion of BSFs that express high level of AUF1. To this end, TCF64-ORF-SFCM and TCF64-CTL-SFCM were applied on cytokine array, which showed higher secreted level of IL-6 in TCF64-ORF-SFCM than in TCF64-CTL-SFCM (Fig.\u00a04A). This was confirmed by ELISA, which showed a three-fold increase in the level of the secreted IL-6 from AUF1-expressing cells relative to their controls (Fig.\u00a04B). In order to confirm the role of BSF-secreted IL-6 in promoting EMT and stemness in BC cells, IL-6 was neutralized using a specific anti-IL-6 antibody in TCF64-ORF-SFCM, while IgG was used as negative control in both TCF64-ORF-SFCM and TCF64-CTL-SFCM. Interestingly, IL-6 inhibition in TCF64-ORF-SFCM upregulated the level of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCAM, while it reduced the expression level of\u00a0the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and the stemness markers CD44 and ALDH1 as well as cyclin D1 in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 BC cells (Fig.\u00a04C). This IL-6 neutralization in TCF64-ORF-SFCM led to inhibition of cell proliferation, migration as well as self-renewal capacity of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 as compared to the respective controls (Fig.\u00a04D, E). This indicates that IL-6 mediates the pro-carcinogenic effects of BSFs that express high level of AUF1.Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote breast tumor growthBSFs that express high level of AUF1 promote tumor growth in mice. A Orthotopic breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with TCF64-ORF or TCF64-CTL cells into the mammary fat pads of nude mice (n\u2009=\u20095).

D Representative photographs of histologic sections subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and to anti\u2010Ki-67 antibody. Scale bar\u2009=\u200950\u00a0\u03bcm. E Protein extracts were prepared from the excised tumors and were used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers below the bands indicate fold changes relative to the control (T-TCF64-CTL) after normalization against GAPDHTo further show the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of AUF1-expressing fibroblasts, we decided to test this effect in vivo using orthotopic tumor xenografts. To this end, TCF64-ORF and TCF64-CTL cells (2.106) were co-injected with MDA-MB-231 cells (2.106) into the fat pad of nude mice. Interestingly, palpable tumors containing TCF64-ORF-SFCM (T-TCF64-ORF) cells were detected 2\u00a0weeks post-injection, while those containing the control cells (T-TCF64-CTL) became visible 3\u00a0weeks post-injection (Fig.\u00a05A). The graph shows also that the T-TCF64-ORF tumors grew faster than their corresponding controls (Fig.\u00a05A). The pictures of two obtained tumors from each group are depicted in Fig.\u00a05B, which shows that the tumors bearing TCF64-ORF-SFCM cells are much bigger than the control tumors. Next, tumors were excised and weighed and whole cell lysates were prepared. Interestingly, all the T-TCF64-ORF tumors are bigger and heavier than the T-TCF64-CTL tumors (Fig.\u00a05C). Hematoxylin and eosin staining on paraffin-embedded sections showed more necrosis in T-TCF64-CTL compared to T-TCF64-ORF. Moreover, Ki-67 level was higher in T-TCF64-ORF than in the respective controls (Fig.\u00a05D). This indicates that orthotopic breast tumors containing TCF64-ORF grew faster owing to their higher proliferative capacity than their corresponding control tumors. Figure\u00a05E shows that the presence of TCF64-ORF cells enhanced the expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin and reduced the expression of the epithelial markers EpCAM and E-cadherin. Furthermore, T-TCF64-ORF tumors expressed lower level of CD24 and higher levels of the stemness makers CD44, ALDH1 and OCT4 (Fig.\u00a05E). This indicates that the TCF64-ORF cells promoted the mesenchymal and the stemness features in the humanized breast cancer tumors in mice.Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote chemoresistance in breast cancer cellsBSFs that express high level of AUF1 confer chemoresistance to BC cells in a paracrine fashion. A MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 and MCF-7 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells per well) were seeded in 96\u2010well plates and were incubated with TCF64-ORF-SFCM or TCF64-CTL-SFCM for 24\u00a0h and then were either sham-treated or challenged with different concentrations of cisplatin (30 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) or docetaxel (1 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h. Cell cytotoxicity was assessed using the WST1 assay and recorded as percent of survived cells relative to the untreated cells.

To this end, we incubated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with SFCM from TCF64-ORF or its corresponding control TCF64-CTL for 24\u00a0h, and then, cells were either sham-treated or challenged with cisplatin (30 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) or docetaxel (1 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h. The WST1 assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of both drugs. Figure\u00a06A shows that exposing BC cells to TCF64-ORF-SFCM resulted in a significant increase in their resistance to both cisplatin and docetaxel as compared to controls.To confirm these findings at the molecular level, immunoblotting analysis was performed to evaluate the level of the important pro-apoptotic proteins PARP and caspase-9 in pre-treated BC cells. The obtained results indicate that TCF64-ORF-SCFM reduced the cisplatin- and docetaxel-dependent increase in the level of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-9 as compared to controls for both cell lines (Fig.\u00a06B, C). These results reveal that BSFs that express high level of AUF1 protect breast cancer cells from the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and docetaxel in a paracrine manner.DiscussionLABC, the most aggressive BC subtype, remains a challenging clinical problem in most developing countries with high disease relapse and poor survival rates. In order to improve the treatment of these patients, it is crucial to identify biomarkers with efficient predictive value. Thereby, we sought in the present study to evaluate the prognostic/predictive power of the expression level of AUF1 in patients suffering LABC. We have first shown significant association between high AUF1 level in both CAFs and cancer cells and high tumor grade (P\u2009=\u20090.0021 and P\u2009=\u20090.0295, respectively). Furthermore, high AUF1 level in fibroblasts was associated with poor DFS and OS, which was confirmed by univariate Cox regression analysis. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the AUF1 level in stromal fibroblasts is a significant independent predictor of DFS and OS (P\u2009=\u20090.0249, P\u2009=\u20090.0315, respectively). On the other hand, AUF1 level in cancer cells was not associated with survival of LABC patients.When AUF1 level was assessed in the four well-defined breast cancer subtypes, we have found that AUF1-positive stromal fibroblasts were significantly correlated with poor survival of both ER+/Her2\u2212 and ER\u2212/Her2\u2212 patients (Fig.\u00a01C). Similarly, high expression of AUF1 in malignant cells tended to be associated with shorter survival of ER+/Her2+ patients. These findings indicate that the expression level of AUF1 in breast CAFs has a powerful prognostic value for TNBC as well as ER+/Her2\u2212 patients. In fact, several lines of evidence point to the key role of CAFs in modulating the response of breast cancer patients to various types of therapies.Additionally, we have observed significant neoadjuvant therapy-dependent change in the expression of AUF1 in malignant cells, with AUF1 downregulation in 46% of cases. Importantly, AUF1 downregulation to a level lower than 10% (cutoff) in tumors was significantly associated with better OS and DFS (P\u2009=\u20090.043 and P\u2009=\u20090.039, respectively). However, this decrease was not significant in CAFs, and therefore, it did not improve survival. This shows the importance of developing specific anti-AUF1 inhibitors for more efficient precision medicine.It has been recently shown that AUF1 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines and this was associated with a poor prognosis. This shows that the importance of AUF1 as prognostic biomarker may not be limited to BC but could be also highly informative for other types of cancer.We have previously shown that AUF1 is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to their paired counterparts, and also, AUF1 plays a major role in the activation of BSFs. Thereby, in order to provide a molecular explanation as to the association between high AUF1 expression in CAFs and the unfavorable prognosis, we investigated the paracrine effects of BSFs that ectopically express AUF1 on breast cancer cells. We have shown that AUF1 upregulation in BSFs promotes EMT and stemness in breast cancer cells in an IL-6-dependent manner. More importantly, AUF1-expressing BSFs enhanced the resistance of BC cells to the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of platinum as well as docetaxel chemotherapeutic agents. This indicates that AUF1 upregulation in BSFs promotes carcinogenesis and also reduces the response of BC cells to various chemotherapeutic agents, which explains the poor outcome of patients with tumors expressing high level of AUF1 in their stromal fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01). This suggests that breast fibroblast AUF1 could be considered as a novel prognostic biomarker, which could also be specifically targeted for precision therapy of BC patients.The prognostic power of breast CAFs has been previously shown based on the expression level of different genes such as CAV-1, \u03b1-SMA, FAP-\u03b1, podoplanin and others. Furthermore, we have recently shown that ATR-negative CAFs predict a poor OS as well as DFS for breast cancer patients.ConclusionsTogether, these findings indicate that breast CAFs have important predictive/prognostic power that should be taken into consideration for the stratification and precise treatment of these patients, especially the hard-to-treat form of the disease (TNBC). This is due to the fact that these genetically stable and relatively abundant non-cancerous stromal cells have the ability to promote tumor growth, progression as well as the response to various anticancer agents. This also indicates that personalized CAFs-targeted therapies may enable more efficient therapeutic responses.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCSCsCancer stem cellsEMTEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionORFOpen reading frameNBFsNormal breast fibroblastsTCFsTumor counterpart fibroblastsTMETumor microenvironmentPublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Taher Al-Tweigeri and Noura N.
