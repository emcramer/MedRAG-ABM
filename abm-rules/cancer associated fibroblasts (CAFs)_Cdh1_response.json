    "## Potential Rules for Cdh1 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Cdh1 decreases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can become activated upon encountering cancer cells, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. However, E-cadherin (CDH1) is a known target of miR-9, which is secreted by breast cancer cells and promotes the conversion of NFs to CAFs (Document [0]). Therefore, a decrease in CDH1 levels in CAFs could indicate a shift towards a more activated phenotype. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of cancer cells present in the tumor model. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Cdh1 increases transform to epithelial from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can be re-educated towards a less activated phenotype, potentially due to the influence of anti-tumor therapies or other cellular processes. Since CDH1 is a marker of epithelial cells, an increase in CDH1 levels in CAFs could indicate a shift towards a less activated, more epithelial-like phenotype. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific types and levels of anti-tumor therapies present in the tumor model. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Cdh1 decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs may become less motile upon encountering dead cells, potentially due to phagocytosis or other cellular processes. CDH1 is a known target of miR-9, which is secreted by breast cancer cells and promotes the conversion of NFs to CAFs (Document [0]). Therefore, a decrease in CDH1 levels in CAFs could indicate a shift towards a less motile phenotype. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of dead cells present in the tumor model. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided information and the relevant documents. Further research and validation are needed to confirm their accuracy and applicability to specific tumor models. "
