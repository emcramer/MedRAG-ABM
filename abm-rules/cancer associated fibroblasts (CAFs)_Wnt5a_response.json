    "## Potential Rules for Wnt5a in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules governing the behavior of CAFs in response to Wnt5a, along with justifications based on the provided research papers: **Rule 1:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases ECM remodeling. **Justification:** Several studies suggest that Wnt5a promotes ECM remodeling in CAFs. For example, in [Document 19], it was found that CTHRC1, a protein involved in ECM remodeling, was upregulated in CAFs and promoted breast cancer cell migration, invasiveness, and EMT by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Similarly, in [Document 10], Oroxylin A, a flavone that inhibits CAF activation, was shown to decrease the expression of ECM components like fibronectin and vimentin. [Document 64] also highlights the role of Wnt5a in promoting ECM remodeling by CAFs, suggesting that loss of H3K27me3 in CAFs leads to increased Wnt5a expression and subsequent ECM remodeling. **Rule 2:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases proliferation. **Justification:** Wnt5a has been shown to promote proliferation in various cell types, including CAFs. In [Document 19], CTHRC1, a Wnt5a target, was found to promote human colorectal cancer cell proliferation. [Document 64] also suggests that Wnt5a, upregulated in CAFs due to loss of H3K27me3, promotes cell growth. **Rule 3:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases migration speed. **Justification:** Wnt5a has been shown to promote migration in various cell types, including CAFs. In [Document 19], CTHRC1, a Wnt5a target, was found to promote human oral cancer cell migration. [Document 6] also suggests that CAF-derived LRRC15 promotes the migration and invasion of TNBC cells via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway regulation. **Rule 4:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases secretion of CCL2. **Justification:** CCL2 is a chemokine that can attract macrophages to the tumor microenvironment. In [Document 10], Oroxylin A, a flavone that inhibits CAF activation, was shown to reduce the secretion of CCL2 in CAFs. This suggests that Wnt5a, which promotes CAF activation, may increase CCL2 secretion. **Rule 5:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases the expression of MMP7. **Justification:** MMP7 is a matrix metalloproteinase that can degrade the extracellular matrix, promoting tumor invasion. In [Document 15], Wnt5a was found to mediate the upregulation of MMP7 by FOXC1 in TNBC cells. This suggests that Wnt5a may also promote MMP7 expression in CAFs. **Rule 6:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases the expression of TGF-\u03b2. **Justification:** TGF-\u03b2 is a cytokine that can promote CAF activation and tumor progression. In [Document 10], Oroxylin A, a flavone that inhibits CAF activation, was shown to decrease the expression of TGF-\u03b2 in CAFs. This suggests that Wnt5a, which promotes CAF activation, may increase TGF-\u03b2 expression. **Rule 7:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases the expression of SDF-1. **Justification:** SDF-1 is a chemokine that can attract endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to the tumor microenvironment, promoting angiogenesis. In [Document 1], FOSL2, a transcription factor that promotes VEGF-independent angiogenesis by transcriptionally activating Wnt5a in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts, was shown to be regulated by estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling. This suggests that Wnt5a, which is regulated by FOSL2, may also promote SDF-1 expression in CAFs. **Rule 8:** In CAFs, Wnt5a increases the expression of PDGF-C. **Justification:** PDGF-C is a growth factor that can promote angiogenesis and tumor growth. In [Document 1], it was found that CAFs from resistant EL4 tumors can mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy via VEGF-independent PDGF-C signaling. This suggests that Wnt5a, which promotes VEGF-independent angiogenesis, may also promote PDGF-C expression in CAFs. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided research papers and may not be exhaustive. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between Wnt5a and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. "
