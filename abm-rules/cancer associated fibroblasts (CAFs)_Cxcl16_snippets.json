IntroductionBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasia among women worldwide, accounting for 25% of all cancer cases. Despite advances in early detection and adjuvant treatment, about 30% of patients may experience recurrent disease and will eventually die of it. Therefore, there is a critical need for the discovery of adequate therapeutic and prognosis biomarkers to improve clinical outcomes.In many solid tumors, malignant initiation and progression is associated with the activation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), characterized by the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activated protein (FAP). CAFs are the predominant cellular component within the host stromal constituents and, acting as a motile cohesive unit able to penetrate the cancerous compartment and as a paracrine signaling source niche, possess the abilities to drive tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. The key features of CAFs, which distinguish them from their normal counterparts, include their growth characteristic, migratory behavior, and biosynthetic activities, such as altered expression of growth factors and cytokines (e.g., transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and II (IGF-II), leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7), C-X-C motif Chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and 16 (CXCL16)). However, in spite of these studies, strategies to treat human breast cancer stroma are just beginning to emerge.Specific phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, are being used in clinical practice to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) as well as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but these agents have also been identified as one of the most successful cases of drug repurposing because they were initially developed for angina and then repositioned for further disorders. In this scenario, recent attention in examining their potential uses as anticancer agents acting with new mechanisms has been drawn, due to the detection of enhanced PDE5 levels in various human tumors in comparison with normal or surrounding non-cancerous tissues. PDE5 inhibitors are effective, safe, and well-tolerated molecules that act by specifically inhibiting the activity of PDE5, a metallo-hydrolase with the unique function of catalyzing the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) into its biologically inactive 5\u2032-derivative, thus modulating the amplitude and duration of cGMP levels and the associated biological responses. The signaling mediated by cGMP, via several activated downstream effectors, including PKG (cGMP-dependent protein kinase), cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels and/or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathways, has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor pathway, halting tumor growth, invasiveness, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, altered cGMP homeostasis and increased PDE5 expression have been described in several human carcinomas, such as those of the breast. In breast cancer clinical samples, PDE5 overexpression was validated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assays, and was associated with important clinical parameters, such as tumor grading, stage, lymph node positivity, and poor prognosis. Accordingly, several \u2018in vitro\u2019 observations have shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of PDE5 inhibitors. These drugs may also act as chemopreventive agents, due to their ability to suppress 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the blockade of PDE5, which is mainly expressed in the stromal compartment of the prostate, reduced fibroblast proliferation and reverted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation of primary prostatic stromal cells, a hallmark of stromal remodeling, highlighting the potential of PDE5 inhibitors to target the stromal compartment.Herein, we show for the first time, that PDE5 is overexpressed in breast cancer stroma and plays an important role in pro-neoplastic features of activated fibroblasts through the secretion of CXCL16. Our results identified a novel molecular target able to abrogate stromal\u2013tumor cell interactions and thus attenuate breast tumorigenesis, with important implications in translational oncology.2. Results2.1. Aberrant High PDE5 Expression in the Stroma Is Associated with Breast Cancer ProgressionTo investigate the role of PDE5 stromal expression in breast cancer, we first analyzed its levels using a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset consisting of stroma derived from invasive ductal breast carcinomas and individual-matched normal breast adjacent tissues. PDE5 expression was significantly higher in breast cancer stroma samples as compared to normal ones (Figure 1A). However, its expression did not significantly associate with molecular subtypes, lymph node status, grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 positivity, most probably due to the small number of patients in each subgroup. Importantly, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis showed that increased PDE5 stromal levels were correlated with a statistically significant shorter overall survival of breast cancer patients in respect to tumors expressing low levels of the enzyme in their stroma (Figure 1B), proposing a potential role for stromal PDE5 in breast carcinoma progression.To confirm these clinical observations, fibroblasts were extracted from two human invasive mammary ductal carcinomas (named as CAFs 1 and 2) and characterized on the basis of their long and spindle-shaped morphology and elevated expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) as compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs) (Supplementary Figure S1). Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that PDE5 mRNA expression was higher in CAFs than NFs (Figure 2A). Increased PDE5 expression in CAFs was also confirmed by evaluating protein levels using immunoblotting (Figure 2B). Of relevance, treatment with the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil significantly reduced the expression of activated fibroblast markers, such as FAP and \u03b1-SMA in CAFs (Figure 2C). Furthermore, inhibition of PDE5 activity resulted in a significant decrease in CAF proliferation (Figure 2D,E), motility (Figure 2F,G), and invasion (Figure 2H). In line with previous findings shown in cancer epithelial cells, our data also highlighted a major role for PDE5 in controlling migration and invasion processes in stromal cells. We then investigated whether PDE5 may function as a possible regulator of CAF impact on adjacent breast tumor cell proliferation and migration by using co-culture experiments. MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells, a commonly used and well characterized \u2018in vitro\u2019 model of the most frequent human breast cancer subtype (i.e., luminal A estrogen receptor-positive one), were co-cultured with conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs treated with sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil and growth was assessed by soft agar anchorage-independent assay (Figure 2I, upper panel). As expected, colony numbers of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were significantly increased in the presence of CAF-derived CM compared to control medium (-), whereas they were significantly reduced when cells were incubated with CM derived from CAFs treated with PDE5 inhibitors. In the same experimental conditions, sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil negatively affected CAF-mediated increase on MCF-7 cell migration (Figure 2I, lower panel).Based on these results showing that PDE5 inhibition may thwart tumor-fostering capabilities of CAFs \u2018in vitro\u2019, mouse xenograft models were used to investigate sildenafil effects on breast cancer growth \u2018in vivo\u2019. To mimic the in vivo conditions where cancer epithelial cells coexist with CAFs within a tumor microenvironment, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were implanted with CAFs into the mouse intrascapular region and tumor growth was observed after the treatment with vehicle or 25 mg/kg/day sildenafil. This administration was well accepted since no modifications in body mass, food/water ingestion, and motor function were detected. Furthermore, after their sacrifice, we did not observe any changes in the weight and the histology of the main organs (i.e., liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) between vehicle- and sildenafil-treated mice, denoting an absence of toxic outcomes at the dose chosen. As presented in Figure 3A, sildenafil treatment induced a significant regression in tumor growth of MCF-7/CAF groups compared to vehicle treatment. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin stain revealed an increased infiltration of CAFs into the breast tumor bulk in vehicle-treated mice, but not in sildenafil-treated ones (Figure 3B). Incubation with anti-human Cytokeratin 18 and \u03b1-SMA antibodies was performed to confirm the human epithelial and connective origin in examined tissues (Figure 3B). According to previously shown results, \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs was reduced after sildenafil exposure. In addition, we revealed in sildenafil-treated xenograft tumors a significant decrease of protein levels of Ki67, a widely recognized proliferation indicator, in breast cancer epithelial cells (Figure 3B).Therefore, these data provide, for the first time, evidence that PDE5 is overexpressed in CAFs and could contribute to their tumor-promoting features.2.2. PDE5 Overexpression Activates Fibroblasts towards a Cancer-Associated Fibroblast PhenotypeTo better evaluate the significance of PDE5 overexpression in stroma, immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were selected to have an experimental \u2018in vitro\u2019 cellular model displaying forced overexpression of this enzyme. PDE5 cDNA, cloned in frame with the enhanced-green-fluorescent-protein (EGFP) in mammalian pEGFP-C1 expression vector, was stably transfected in MEFs and obtained clones were examined by using immunoblotting analysis. The presence of endogenous (~95 kDa) and exogenous (EGFP-tagged, ~125 kDa) PDE5 bands in protein extracts from PDE5-overexpressing stable clones was shown (Figure 4A). First, we evaluated whether the overexpression of PDE5 may induce modifications in cellular phenotype, such as proliferative, motile, and invasive features of MEFs. MTT and cell count anchorage-dependent growth assays revealed an increase in cell proliferation in PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts (PDE5 1 and 2) in comparison with control vector-expressing clones (V) (Figure 4B,C). Then, we assessed whether PDE5 overexpression may influence fibroblast motility in wound-healing assays and observed that PDE5-overexpressing cells moved faster than V clones (Figure 4D). Accordingly, we also found that PDE5 overexpression significantly increased both motility and invasion of MEFs in Boyden chamber transmigration and invasion assays, respectively (Figure 4E,F). We then evaluated whether PDE5 overexpression could affect actin organization, specifically actin stress-fiber formation that is crucial in the transmission of the cellular forces required for motility. In vector-expressing fibroblasts, actin fibers were visible as bright structures diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, while an increase of stress fiber formation was evident in PDE5-expressing MEFs (Figure 4G, upper panel). Accordingly, markers of fibroblast motility, including N-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA, Rho A-C, Rac 1-3, and cdc42, were up-regulated in PDE5 1 and 2 cells (Figure 4G, lower panel and 4H). After having evaluated the effects of PDE5 overexpression on fibroblast phenotype, we investigated whether or not PDE5 overexpression may impact tumor\u2013stroma crosstalk in co-culture experiments. Soft agar assay showed that colony numbers of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were significantly increased when cells were incubated with CM derived from vehicle-treated PDE5-overexpressing MEFs compared to CM derived from vehicle-treated vector-expressing MEFs, while this induction was no longer evident when cells were co-cultured with CM derived from sildenafil-treated PDE5-overexpressing MEFs (Figure 4I, upper panel). As shown in Figure 4I (lower panel), PDE5 overexpression in MEFs also stimulated breast cancer cell motility and sildenafil treatment of CAFs reversed these effects, further highlighting the potential of PDE5 to influence stromal fibroblast activation.To extend the results obtained, we generated pools of pEGFP-Vector (V P) and pEGFP-PDE5 (PDE5 P) stable transfectants in MEFs (Supplementary Figure S2A). As previously demonstrated, increased proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities of MEFs (Supplementary Figure S2B\u2013F) along with elevated expression of CAF markers (Supplementary Figure S2G,H) were observed in the presence of PDE5 overexpression. Again, growth and migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were enhanced in the presence of CM derived from PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts compared to vector pools and this increase was reversed in the presence of CM derived from sildenafil-treated PDE5 pools (Supplementary Figure S2I).Some studies have reported that cancer epithelial cells can also shape tumor stroma. Interestingly, when MEFs were co-cultured with MCF-7 breast cancer cells, they exhibited an up-regulation of PDE5 in terms of both mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4L), supporting the idea that the \u2018host\u2019 stroma talks to and coevolves with the malignant epithelium during progression.2.3. CXCL16 Mediates the Tumor Promoting Effects of PDE5-Overexpressing FibroblastsActivated fibroblasts secrete a number of signaling molecules that promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, to gain more insights into the biological properties of PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts, we analyzed factors secreted from vector (V) and PDE5-overexpressing (PDE5 2) clones by cytokine array (Figure 5A). The comparison of the secretome between the two cell models revealed differences in several secreted proteins, and among them, the chemokine CXCL16 was the most highly upregulated in response to PDE5 overexpression. To validate this expression profile, we first compared the mRNA levels of CXCL16 in vector and PDE5-transfected cells. As shown in Figure 5B, increased expression of this gene was detected in cloned PDE5-expressing fibroblasts compared with vector ones. Moreover, ELISA (Figure 5C) and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 5D) revealed higher protein expression levels of CXCL16 in PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts than in vector MEFs. Consistent with these results, treatment with a neutralizing antibody to CXCL16 reduced proliferation (Figure 5E), motility (Figure 5F), and invasion (Figure 5G) of PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts. More relevantly, treatment with the CXCL16 neutralizing antibody was able to significantly abolish the stimulatory effects exerted by CM derived from PDE5-overexpressing MEFs on both growth and motility of MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Figure 5H).Collectively, these results strongly suggest that increased stromal PDE5 may influence fibroblast phenotype and their effects on breast cancer cell growth and motility through CXCL16.2.4. Association of PDE5 and CXCL16 in the Stroma of Breast Cancer PatientsIn order to further examine the role of CXCL16 as a key player in PDE5-associated stromal activation, we evaluated changes in CXCL16 expression in human breast CAFs treated with PDE5 inhibitors. Real-time RT-PCR assay revealed that treatment with sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil led to a significant reduction of CXCL16 mRNA levels (Figure 6A). In addition, both ELISA (Figure 6B) and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 6C) demonstrated that PDE5 inhibition reduced CXCL16 protein expression in CAFs. Accordingly, immunohistochemistry analysis in mouse tumor tissues showed that sildenafil decreased stromal CXCL16 levels also \u2018in vivo\u2019 (Figure 6D).Finally, to support the clinical significance of these findings, we analyzed CXCL16 expression levels in the previously mentioned human breast tumor stroma microarray. CXCL16 expression was found to be higher in stroma samples of invasive ductal carcinomas compared to normal adjacent stroma (Figure 6E). The Kaplan\u2013Meier overall survival curve indicated that increased expression levels of stroma CXCL16 are associated with a statistically significant shorter survival (Figure 6F). As previously shown for stromal PDE5, CXCL16 expression did not significantly correlate with breast cancer molecular subtypes, lymph node status, grade, ER, PR, and HER2 positivity. However, we found that CXCL16 showed a strong correlation with PDE5 expression in the same dataset (p = 0.00023). In addition, patients with high PDE5 and high CXCL16 levels had a statistically significantly poorer overall survival compared with all other patients (Figure 6G).Therefore, high levels of PDE5 and CXCL16 can be detected in breast tumor stroma and their stromal expression may predict poor outcome among breast cancer patients.3. DiscussionWhile the initial view was that PDE5 is highly expressed and can function in breast cancer cells, we show here that this enzyme is also upregulated in CAFs when compared to normal fibroblasts and this overexpression is a part of the dialogue between breast cancer cells and CAFs, allowing CAFs via CXCL16 secretion to promote breast cancer progression. These data shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk of stromal-tumor cells and may hold prognostic information as well as a new strategy for stromal cell targeting.Over a century ago, the seminal work of English surgeon Stephen Paget reported that cancer cells constitute the \u2018seeds\u2019 that colonize a receptive stromal microenvironment acting as a favorable \u2018soil\u2019. A crucial \u2018soil\u2019 compartment is represented by fibroblasts that acquire a cancerous phenotype in response to the \u2018seed\u2019 cancer cells to facilitate their proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Thus, CAFs not only support, but are the key protagonists in breast carcinogenesis, owing to their abundance and their tumor-promoting roles. However, the molecular genetic drivers governing the emergence of CAF cellular behavior and the regulation of stromal\u2013epithelial interactions are still poorly understood. Some reports have shown that specific gene transcripts within CAFs may be involved in breast cancer cell growth and metastasis, such as the loss of p85\u03b1, the Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), or TGF-receptor type 2 as well as the overexpression of cyclin D1. Herein, we show that PDE5 overexpression may represent an important feature of fibroblast activation and heterotypic signaling promotion within the breast tumor microenvironment. Indeed, we found that the levels of PDE5 gene are increased in breast cancer stroma compared to normal stroma and this overexpression correlates with the worst survival outcomes, supporting the idea that stromal PDE5 may have an important effect on breast tumor growth. Indeed, stable overexpression of PDE5 activates normal fibroblasts towards a cancer-associated phenotype, as revealed by enhanced cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities along with the increased expression of activated fibroblast markers. PDE5 overexpression in fibroblasts also enhanced breast\u2013tumor crosstalk in \u2018co-culture\u2019 experiments. The functional relevance of stromal PDE5 was highlighted by the inhibitory effects exerted by PDE5-targeting drugs on the activated features of breast CAFs and on breast tumor progression in both \u2018in vitro\u2019 and \u2018in vivo\u2019 experimental models. Of relevance, we found that normal fibroblasts co-cultured with breast cancer cells exhibited an increased PDE5 mRNA and protein expression, pointing out stromal PDE5 as a likely actor in the bidirectional crosstalk between the cancer bulk and its surrounding microenvironment.Accumulating evidences suggest that a wide array of signaling molecules, importantly chemokines, stand at the crossroads of tumor\u2013fibroblast interactions and subsequently impact most of the hallmark capabilities of breast cancer. For instance, the C-X-C chemokine network represents a unique group of molecules and receptors recognized for their involvement in tumor biology, including their direct effects on cancer cells, such as transformation, survival, and proliferation, and indirect effects, such as angiogenesis and immune cell recruitment into tumor sites. Several studies have proposed a multifaceted role for CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the progression of different tumors, including those of the prostate, liver, ovaries, and breast, as was widely demonstrated for CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4 pair. Indeed, CXCR6 and CXCL16 are upregulated in multiple cancer tissues, including primary and metastatic tissues, and cancer cell lines compared to respective normal ones and their levels increase as tumor malignancy progresses. Moreover, CXCL16 via interaction with CXCR6 is capable of increasing cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in breast cancer. Our findings indicated that PDE5 overexpression can activate stromal fibroblasts to produce and secrete CXCL16 that, in turn, may contribute to breast cancer progression by serving as a proliferative signal and as a regulator of motility. Accordingly, the addition of a CXCL16 neutralizing antibody abolished the pro-tumoral stimulatory effects of conditioned medium derived from PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts on breast cancer cell growth and migration. However, fibroblast-secreted CXCL16 not only orchestrates paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling to the adjacent breast cancer cells, but it can also modulate intrinsic characteristics of activated fibroblasts in an autocrine manner, since a significant inhibition in the proliferative, motile, and invasive capabilities of activated PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts was evident in the presence of a CXCL16 neutralizing antibody. On the other hand, PDE5 inhibition significantly reduced CXCL16 expression and secretion in CAFs, indicating that CXCL16 and PDE5 levels can be correlated. Indeed, as shown for stromal PDE5 levels, increased stromal expression of CXCL16 was found in breast cancer stroma compared to the corresponding normal tissue stroma and was associated with poor overall survival in Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. More importantly, our results showed a significant association between the expression levels of PDE5 and CXCL16 in the stroma of breast cancer patients and a statistically significantly poorer overall survival in patients with high PDE5 and high CXCL16 levels compared with all other patients.4.

Human CXCL16 was measured in CAF CM by using RayBio Human CXCL16 ELISA Kit based on the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (RayBiotech). Results are presented as pg/mL/number of cells.4.15. \u2018In Vivo\u2019 ExperimentsThe \u2018in vivo\u2019 experiments were performed in 45-day-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories, Udine, Italy) maintained in a sterile environment. The animals were fully anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of avertin 250 mg/kg to allow the subcutaneous implantation of estradiol (E2) pellets (0.72 mg per pellet, 90-day release; Innovative Research of America) into the dorso-lateral region. The day after, exponentially growing MCF-7 cells (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in combination with CAFs (ratio 3:1 tumor cells/CAFs) were inoculated subcutaneously in 0.1 mL of Matrigel into the intrascapular region. The subcutaneous location was chosen to exclude the effect of other mammary gland cellular components on the interaction of human breast cancer fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Sildenafil treatment (25 mg/kg/day) was started when mean tumor size reached 150 mm3 (day 0) and was delivered daily to the animals by i.p. injection. Tumor development was followed twice a week by caliper measurements along two orthogonal axes: length (L) and width (W). The volume (V) of tumors was estimated by the following formula: V = L \u00d7 (W2)/2. At day 20 the animals were sacrificed following the standard protocols and tumors were dissected from the neighboring connective tissue. Specimens of tumors were frozen in nitrogen and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C. The remaining tumor tissues of each sample, livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for the histological analyses. All animals were maintained and handled in accordance with the recommendation of the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of University of Calabria, Italy (1290/2015-PR, 18/12/2015).4.16. Histopathological AnalysisTumors, livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys were fixed in 4% formalin, sectioned into 5 \u03bcm of thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin Y (H&E), as suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Optica). H&E was photographed at 20\u00d7 magnification (Olympus BX51 microscope, Segrate, IT, Italy).4.17. Immunohistochemical Analysis Paraffin-embedded sections, 5 \u03bcm thick, were mounted on slides precoated with poly-lysine, and then they were deparaffinized and dehydrated (seven to eight serial sections). Immunohistochemical experiments were performed after heat-mediated antigen retrieval, using human Cytokeratin 18, \u03b1-SMA, Ki-67, or CXCL16 primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Then, a biotinylated specific IgG was applied for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the avidin biotin alkaline phosphatase complex (VECTASTAIN\u00ae ABC-AP KIT, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Immunoreactivity was visualized by using VECTOR\u00ae Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories). Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich). The primary antibody was replaced by normal serum in negative control sections. The immunostained slides of tumor samples were evaluated by light microscopy using the Allred score, which combines a proportion score and an intensity score. A proportion score was assigned representing the estimated proportion of positively stained tumor cells (0 = none; 1 = 1/100; 2 = 1/100 to <1/10; 3 = 1/10 to <1/3; 4 = 1/3 to 2/3; 5 = >2/3). An intensity score was assigned by the average estimated intensity of staining in positive cells (0 = none; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong). Proportion score and intensity score were added to obtain a total score that ranged from 0 to 8. A minimum of 100 cells were evaluated in each slide. Six to seven serial sections were scored in a blinded manner for each sample. The one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences in the scores between tumor and control samples.4.18. Analysis of Human Stroma Gene Expression DataThe data regarding human breast cancer stroma-based gene expression (GSE9014) were downloaded from the the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Briefly, from a cohort of 73 women with invasive breast carcinoma diagnosis (median follow-up time: 3.58 years), 53 samples of tumor stroma and 31 individual-matched normal adjacent stroma samples were collected. ER positive (luminal) samples constituted 72.3% of the patients, HER2 enriched (HER2 positive ER negative) constituted 10.3% of the specimens, and triple negative (ER/PR/HER2 negative) constituted 11.8% of the patients. The remaining patients (5.6%) had discordant status for ER and PR determination. No woman in the study was treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Poor outcome was defined as alive with disease or dead of disease at the time of the latest follow-up. This dataset was generated using the Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A platform. The probe 37097 was used to detect PDE5 expression. The dye-swapped repetitions were inverted and averaged to get the final expression value for each sample.4.19. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed for statistical significance using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, and GraphPad-Prism 4 software program. SEM is shown. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival plot and log rank p-value were calculated and plotted in R as described. Cox proportional hazard regression was computed to compare the association between gene expression, clinical variables including ER/PR/HER2/lymph node/grade status, and survival in multivariate analysis using WinSTAT 2014 for Microsoft Excel (WinStat 2014, Robert K. Fitch Software, Bad Krozingen, DE, Germany). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.5. ConclusionsBreast tumor microenvironment represents a functional ecosystem of neoplastic epithelial cells and stroma with critical roles in most of cancer progression processes. Therefore, it is not surprising that an increasing proportion of research is currently focusing on the development of double-acting anti-cancer strategies targeted toward both breast cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. Another more pragmatic reason underlying the exciting interest on anti-stromal therapies is that stromal cells are more genetically stable than cancer cells. In light of the present and our previous study, we can speculate that PDE5 activity may regulate several aspects of breast carcinogenesis both directly on neoplastic epithelial cells and indirectly via modulation of CAF phenotype. Therefore, since PDE5 inhibitors are safely and successfully used in patients suffering from different pathologies, our results may endorse their use as repurposed concurrent treatments to conventional anti-cancer agents to provide more effective options for breast cancer women. To date, a randomized Phase I trial was completed for evaluating the potential of sildenafil to enhance doxorubicin anti-tumor effects and cardioprotection in breast cancer patients (NCT01375699), but no details have been published yet. In addition, stromal PDE5 may represent not only a feasible therapeutic target but may also hold a potential prognostic value identifying patients with a poorer clinical outcome. Taken together, the present findings may open a promising research area which needs to be further explored for deepening our understanding of tumor evolution and offering new avenue for future cancer management.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at .

Peter P. Lee and colleagues from the City of Hope in Duarte, California, USA, analyzed protein and gene expression levels in brain metastases, and showed that it is the stromal cells (support cells such as fibroblasts), rather than the cancer cells themselves, that are the source of these homing signals. When compared against stromal cells derived from primary breast tumors or healthy breast tissue, they found that the stromal cells that had lodged themselves in the brain expressed the highest levels of CXCL12 and CXCL16, two chemokines involved in cell movement. Using three-dimensional aggregates, the researchers showed that these metastatic stromal cells promoted cancer cells migration more potently than stromal cells from primary tumors or normal breast tissues. Blocking the chemokine activity or that of its receptor impaired cancer cell movement, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy for preventing brain metastasis in patients with breast cancer. These results highlight the importance of the tumor microenvironment and stromal cells in the metastasis process of breast cancer.IntroductionBrain metastasis is the most lethal outcome of breast cancer, leading to death within 4\u20136 months in 10\u201315% of patients once detected. For brain metastasis to occur, cancer cells from the primary tumor must migrate to the brain, traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier, and proliferate within the brain parenchyma. Emerging data suggest that outcome of metastasis is influenced by the specific organ microenvironment stromal cells that permit the effective colonization and growth of circulating tumor cells. We hypothesized that mesenchyme-derived fibroblasts, the major cell population of tumor stroma, promote invasion, survival, and proliferation of migrating cancer cells to facilitate breast cancer brain metastasis.Conventional methods to model the metastatic process ex vivo mainly involve two-dimensional (2D) monolayer in vitro systems, which do not recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) in vivo microenvironment. Cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in 3D spatial environment are critical for understanding the complex cross-talk mechanisms between cancer and stromal cells. For example, both gene and protein expressions in an ex vivo 3D culture system appear to conserve various paracrine-dependent cellular interactions that occur in vivo microenvironment. Furthermore, studies have shown that testing of chemotherapy treatments or immunotherapies based on 2D monolayer systems does not correspond with results in an in vivo setting, further demonstrating the limitations of 2D monolayer systems. Hence, developing and testing the effectiveness of novel therapies for breast cancer in vitro require recreation of the 3D breast cancer microenvironment composed of stroma and cancer cells, ideally derived from the same patient, as one functional unit.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to produce various chemokines to facilitate angiogenesis and cancer cell migration. To investigate the role of CAFs in breast cancer brain metastasis, we isolated and expanded fibroblasts derived from normal breast, primary, and brain metastatic tumor tissues. Utilizing 3-D ex-vivo aggregates composed of different CAFs with cancer cells, we evaluated the expression of various chemokines and growth factors by RNA-Seq, real-time quantitative qPCR, immuno-histochemical staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These studies showed that metastatic CAFs from brain metastases produce high levels of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16, promoting the migration of patient-specific breast cancer cells in a 3-D aggregate system. Moreover, blocking of CXCR4, the chemokine receptor for CXCL12, and neutralization of CXCL16, the ligand for CXCR6 in patient-specific cancer cells significantly prevented the migration of cancer cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME). These novel findings from our 3D CAF aggregate system provide proof of principle that chemokine modulation represents an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent tumor progression and metastasis.ResultsIsolation of breast cancer cells and CAFs from patient tumor tissuesPatient characteristicsNumber of patients\tMedian age of patients\tMean age of patients\t\t\t\t\t \t5\t32\t37\t\t\t\t\t \tSample\tType\tMolecular subtype (ER, PR, Her2)\tTumor grade\tCancer stage\tAge\tBRCA\t \tBC56\tNormal\t\t\t\t48\t(+)\t \tBC78\tNormal\t\t\t\t32\t(+)\t \tBC82\tNormal\t\t\t\t32\t\t \tBC97\tNormal\t\t\t\t47\t\t \tBC 131\tNormal\t\t\t\t25\t(+)\t \tNumber of patients\tMedian age of patients\tMean age of patients\t\t\t\t\t \t8\t58\t55\t\t\t\t\t \tSample\tType\tMolecular subtype (ER, PR, Her2)\tTumor grade\tCancer stage\tAge\t\t \tBC68\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tII\tIA\t64\t\t \tBC80\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tIII\tIIA\t29\t\t \tBC84\tPrimary\t(+), (\u2212), (\u2212)\tIII\t\t72\t\t \tBC 95\tPrimary\t(+), (\u2212), (+)\tIII\tIA\t50\t\t \tBC105\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tIII\tIIA\t71\t\t \tBC108\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tII\tIIA\t39\t\t \tBC153\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tI\tIIIA\t59\t\t \tBC155\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tII\tIIB\t57\t\t \tNumber of patients\tMedian age of patients\tMean age of patients\t\t\t\t\t \t7\t59\t59\t\t\t\t\t \tSample\tType\tMolecular subtype (ER, PR, Her2)\tTumor grade\tCancer stage\tAge\t\t \tBC25\tBrain Met\t(\u2212), (\u2212), (+)\t\t\t66\t\t \tBC55\tBrain Met\t(\u2212), (\u2212), (+)\t\t\t54\t\t \tBC66\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (+)\t\t\t52\t\t \tBC70\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\t\t\t63\t\t \tBC 122\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (+)\t\t\t59\t\t \tBC137\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\t\t\t54\t\t \tBC 156\tBrain Met\t(\u2212), (\u2212), (+)\t\t\t62\t\t \tPrimary breast tumor patients are categorized based on molecular subtypes, tumor grade, cancer stage, and age.

As controls, we also obtained six normal breast tissue samples from either the contralateral breast of breast cancer patients, or patients who underwent prophylactic mastectomy. Histological analysis of both human primary breast and brain metastatic tumor samples showed the presence of vimentin-positive stromal cells surrounding cytokeratin-positive breast cancer cells (Fig.\u00a01a). To study these cells and develop an ex-vivo culture system that allows expansion of both patient-specific breast cancer cells and CAFs, human breast tumor tissue was mechanically dissociated into small fragments, and plated onto tissue culture plate in medium supplemented with epidermal and keratinocyte growth factor. Within 2 weeks, both CD326+ CD44\u2212 cancer cells and CD326\u2212 CD44+ CAFs expanded by outgrowth from the initial tumor fragments (Fig.\u00a01b). To investigate whether CD326\u2212 CD44+ adherent fibroblasts express mesenchyme-derived surface markers, we performed immunophenotypic characterization of the monolayer generated in breast tumor fragment cultures after 3 weeks by flow cytometry. Nearly all the ex vivo expanded mesoderm-derived fibroblasts from normal breast, and CAFs from primary and brain metastatic tumors expressed the common mesenchyme markers CD44, CD90, CD105, CD166, and CD140\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a01c). In contrast, CD326+ breast cancer cells did not display the surface markers expressed by CAFs (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01).  Both semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) (factors known to support growth of cancer cells) were expressed by both primary tumor and brain metastasis CAFs (Fig.\u00a01d and Supplemental Fig.\u00a02). This provides evidence that cultured CAFs produce factors important for maintenance of patient-specific breast cancer cells. Since bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to reside within breast TME and express similar surface markers as CAFs, trans-differentiation assays were performed to determine if some of the CAF populations were capable of undergoing adipogenesis as observed in MSCs. In addition, we further investigated the expression of STRO-1, the surface antigen known to express by bone marrow MSCs. Our data showed that CAFs derived from primary breast tumor and brain metastasis express higher levels of STRO-1, and can differentiate into adipocytes, suggesting our CAF culture contains MSC-like cell populations (Supplemental Fig.\u00a03). Generation of human breast tumor-derived CAF aggregatesGeneration of 3-D human breast cancer microenvironment in vitro. a Schematic representation for generation of 3-D human breast stroma aggregates for in vitro model. Human breast cancer associated breast stromal cells were generated from patient specific primary or brain met tumor tissues ex vivo. Aggregates were then cultured on nucleopore membranes floating in D10 medium supplemented with human epidermal growth factor for 2 weeks for in vitro analyses. b Immuno-histochemical staining comparison between human breast cancer tissues and cancer-associated stromal aggregates. Paraffin-embedded stromal aggregates were sectioned and stained for vimentin, and activated fibroblast markers including alpha smooth muscle and fibroblast activating protein (FAP). Expression of ECM components was analyzed in both tissue section and aggregates. Antibody staining directed against fibronectin and collagen IV showed the presence of ECM in all aggregates. c Immuno-fluorescent antibody staining against Ki67 (red), cytokeratin (yellow) and vimentin (green) in patient-derived aggregates composed of cancer cells mixed with either normal, primary or metastatic stroma. Bar graph illustrates relative expression of Ki67 in cancer cells combined with either normal, primary or metastatic stroma patient samples2-D culture models do not fully replicate complexities in tumor tissues, such as multi-dimensional cellular structure, extracellular matrixes, and divergent gene expression patterns. Hence, we generated 3-D aggregates from cells cultured out of normal breast tissue, primary and metastatic tumors to recapitulate complexities displayed by the human TME. Normal breast fibroblast and patient-specific CAF aggregates were created by centrifugation of monolayers generated from tissue culture, followed by further culturing on nucleo-pore filters (Fig.\u00a02a). In order to demonstrate the ability of 3-D CAF aggregates to produce, and maintain ECM and CAF markers, cell aggregates were cultured and paraffin-sectioned for histological analyses. H&E stains of normal breast and tumor samples showed morphological similarities with their corresponding 3-D CAF aggregates (Supplemental Fig.\u00a04). IHC stains showed that important ECM components, such as Collagen IV and Fibronectin, were preserved in all aggregates as compared to fresh human breast tumor tissues (Fig.\u00a02b). Expression of fibroblastic activating protein (FAP) and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) has been described in myofibroblasts and CAF. As expected, FAP and \u03b1-SMA expressing cells were more prevalent in primary and brain metastasis CAF aggregates when compared to normal fibroblast aggregates (Fig.\u00a02b). To further investigate whether FAP+ \u03b1-SMA+ cells detected from brain metastasis aggregates originated from cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), such as astrocytes and ependymal cells, we examined the expression of glilal fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in brain metastasis aggregates (Supplemental Fig.\u00a05). CAFs from brain metastasis do not express GFAP, suggesting that they are of non-CNS origin. To demonstrate whether our CAF aggregate system can maintain and promote proliferation of cancer cells, we generated CAF aggregates mixed with breast cancer cells and measured Ki-67 expression in cancer cells. Here, we generated patient-derived cancer cells with patient-derived CAF aggregates in order to more fully mimic the natural TME setting. Data shown in Fig.\u00a02c demonstrate that our 3D co-culture system supports proliferation of patient-derived cancer cells. We detected significantly higher numbers of Ki-67-positive cancer cells in primary and metastatic CAF aggregates than from normal breast fibroblasts aggregates (Fig.\u00a02c). Mesenchyme-derived growth factors known to promote cancer cell proliferation (EGF, FGF1, FGF2, and IGF-1) were expressed in different CAF populations to different levels (Fig.\u00a01d and Supplemental Fig.\u00a02). Overall, these results showed that the ex vivo CAF 3-D aggregates system served as a sufficient ECM producing microenvironment and provided growth factors capable of cancer cells proliferation.mRNA level expression and histological analysis of chemokines in primary tumor and brain metastasis-derived human breast CAF 3-D aggregatesGene and protein expression analyses of 3-D human breast cancer CAF aggregates. a Heat map of hierarchical cluster analysis of RNA seq data derived from the normal, primary breast tumor CAF, and brain met CAF aggregates. BC82 and BC97 were used for the normal aggregate group; BC68 and BC80 were used for the primary tumor aggregate group; BC66, BC70 and BC55 were used for the brain metastasis aggregate group (see Table\u00a01). Individual gene dot plots showing changes in mean expression levels of transcripts PDGF\u03b1, CXCL12, and CXCL16. b Quantitative RT-PCR validation of relative changes in expression levels of the CXCL12, CXCL16, and PDGF\u03b1. c Immuno-fluorescent staining directed against CXCL12 and CXCL16 expression from patient tissue and patient-derived CAF aggregate. Representative immuno-fluorescence images show Vimentin (green) and CXCL12/CXCL16 (red) expression in both patient tissues and patient-derived stromal aggregates. Scale bar for zoomed images represent 50\u2009\u00b5m. d Measurement of soluble CXCL16 in media of patient-derived normal, primary and metastatic stroma by ELISA. Metastatic & primary stroma: (#\nP\u2009<\u20090.03)To investigate whether CAF aggregates generated from primary or metastatic breast tumor tissues display different gene expression patterns, RNA samples were extracted from each independent aggregate culture and analyzed via RNA-Seq. The raw FASTQ files obtained from RNA-seq were analyzed via CLC Genomic Workbench to compare gene expression levels between groups. Differences in relative gene expression levels between each CAF aggregate group (normal, primary tumor, and brain metastasis) are shown as a heat map (Fig.\u00a03a) generated through hierarchical clustering. Additionally, a list of the top differentially expressed growth factors and cytokines is shown in Supplemental Table\u00a01. Based on gene transcript expression differences, among the consistently over expressed transcripts in the metastatic aggregates were CXCL16, CXCL12, and platelet-derived growth factor alpha. Amongst these, CXCL16 showed the highest fold change in CAFs from metastatic tumors compared to normal breast or primary tumors (5.34 and 6.436, respectively). While reports have shown that tumors produce high levels of chemokines including CXCL12, these studies did not identify CAFs as the source within the TME. High level secretion of CXCL16 from patient-derived brain metastasis CAFs has not been reported. To further validate differentially expressed transcripts from each group of aggregate, quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Fig.\u00a03b) and IHC were performed on patient tissues and CAF aggregates (Fig.\u00a03c). Relative changes in chemokine genes expression and proteins levels were directly related to the RNA-seq and qRT-PCR data illustrated in Fig.\u00a03a, b. While CXCL16 can exist as either secreted or trans-membrane bound forms, only the soluble form is known to function as a chemotactic ligand for CXCR6-expressing cancer and immune cells. Production of the secreted form of CXCL16 was analyzed via ELISA from each representative CAF population (Fig.\u00a03d). High levels of secreted chemokines observed in the ELISA assay from brain metastatic CAF aggregates provides a mechanism by which breast cancer cells are attracted to the metastatic brain microenvironment.Effects of CAFs in migration of cancer cellsEffects of CAF in migration of cancer cells in vitro. a Immuno-fluorescent images comparing migration of cancer cell line MCF-Her2 (Red) to either normal, primary or metastatic patient-derived CAF aggregate. Bar graph quantifies relative migration of Her-2+ (CD340+) cancer cells to normal (BC69, BC82, BC97, and BC102), primary (BC80, BC95, BC105, and BC108), or metastatic (BC25, BC55, BC66, and BC70) CAF aggregates (see Table\u00a01). b Immunofluorescent images comparing migration of patient-derived cancer cells to either normal, primary or metastatic patient-derived CAF aggregate. Bar graph demonstrates relative migratory count of cancer cells to normal (BC69, BC82, BC97, and BC102), primary (BC80, BC95, BC105, and BC108), or metastatic (BC25, BC55, BC66, and BC70) CAF aggregates. c Immunofluorescence images compare migration of patient-specific cancer cells (green) towards either Primary CAF (Red) or Brain Metastasis CAF (Blue) on Day 0 and Day 4. Bar graph quantifies relative total cell fluorescence of patient-specific cancer cells that have migrated to primary or brain metastatic CAF aggregate. (#\nP\u2009<\u20090.01)Based on our studies indicating that brain metastatic CAF aggregates produced higher levels of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 as compared to normal breast fibroblasts or primary tumor CAF aggregates, we performed cancer cell migration assays (using MCF-HER2 cells or patient-derived cancer cells) to investigate the relative propensity of breast cancer cells to migrate to these different microenvironments. Each aggregate was embedded in hydrogel solution to maintain its overall 3D structure. Figure\u00a04a shows a schematic representation for cancer cell migration in vitro and an example photograph of CAF aggregates in hydrogel with a MCF-HER2 cell line or patient-derived cancer cells embedded in the center. Based on live cell imaging, immunofluorescent microscopy, and FACS analysis, we found that significantly higher numbers of MCF-HER2 cells or patient-derived cancer cells migrated to brain metastatic CAF aggregates than primary CAF or normal breast fibroblasts aggregates (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplemental Fig.\u00a06). To further explore the chemotactic activity of primary or brain metastatic CAF aggregates, we generated PKH-labeled primary (red color) or brain metastatic (blue) CAF aggregates mixed with green color-labeled patient-derived breast cancer cells (1:1 ratio), and positioned these aggregates against a separate CAF aggregate without cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04c). This hydrogel system maintains the architecture of 3-D aggregates, and also allows cancer cell migration and invasion to distant locations. We consistently observed that cancer cells already associated with primary tumor CAFs still migrated out towards brain metastasis CAF aggregates. This migration took a longer period of time than the earlier results observed in Fig.\u00a04a, b, suggesting that cancer cells were still being partially attracted by primary tumor CAFs as they migrated away towards brain metastasis CAFs. These data confirm that brain metastasis CAFs promote migration of breast cancer cells more effectively than normal fibroblasts or primary tumor CAFs.CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody treatments reduce cancer cell recruitmentCombination of CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody treatment reduces cancer cell recruitment. a FACS analysis of relative CXCR4 or CXCR6 expression on cancer cell line MCF HER2 and patient-specific cancer cells derived from brain metastasis or skin metastasis tissue. b Immuno-fluorescent images demonstrate relative migration of patient-specific cancer cells (green) to brain metastasis stroma (red) with or without CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralization in Hydrogel-Migration assay. c: Bar graph quantifies the relative migration of patient specific cancer cells that have been untreated or treated with CXCR4 antagonist, CXCL16 neutralization antibody, or a combination of both agents. An asterisk indicates significant differences between groups of animals (*P\u2009\u2264\u20090.02, **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.045, ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.02). Each value represents the mean of 3\u20135 independent experiments. For the migration assay, BC25, BC55, BC66, BC70 brain metastatic CAF aggregates were independently utilized (see Table\u00a01). Consistent results were obtained in repeated experiments throughout. The vertical bold lines branching off from the top of the horizontal lines represent statistically significant P values when the untreated, CXCR4 antagonist, and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody groups were individually compared with all other groupsTo further investigate the importance of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 secreted by metastatic CAFs on breast cancer cell migration, we analyzed the expression of cognate chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR6 on patient-derived cancer cells. FACS analysis showed that patient-derived breast cancer cells expressed both CXCR4 and CXCR6 (Fig.\u00a05a). Utilizing our hydrogel assay system, patient-derived breast cancer cells were treated with a receptor-blocking antagonist directed against CXCR4 alone or in combination with neutralizing antibody directed against CXCL16 and tested for cancer cell migration to brain metastatic CAF aggregates. Unlike CXCR4 in which a small molecule antagonist Plerixafor (Selleckchem) is available, only anti-CXCL16 neutralizing antibody is available for blocking the CXCR6\u2013CXCL16 interaction. Indeed, CXCR4 antagonist treatment significantly reduced the ability of cancer cells to migrate to brain metastatic CAF aggregates, while CXCL16 antibody treatment was less effective than CXCR4 antagonist treatment alone (Fig.\u00a05b, c). Combination of both inhibitors resulted in blocking cancer cell migration most significantly. These data suggest that secretion of CXCL12 and CXCL16 by CAFs plays a critical role in attracting breast cancer cells to the brain metastatic microenvironment. DiscussionMetastasis involves the abnormal capacity of cancer cells to migrate, and aberrant cancer cell mobility is emerging as an important area of investigation. Why breast cancer cells migrate to the brain to cause metastasis remains incompletely understood, and requires further investigation. In this study, we isolated patient-derived CAFs and cancer cells from primary human breast tumors and brain metastases, and developed 3D models to study their interactions. Based on gene and immunohistological analyses, we found that expression levels of chemokines CXCL16 and CXCL12 are significantly higher in CAFs from brain metastasis than those from primary tumors or normal breast tissues. We further demonstrated that brain metastasis CAF 3D aggregates attract patient-derived breast cancer cells much more effectively than primary tumor CAF or normal fibroblast aggregates in a hydrogel assay system. Blocking CXCR4 and/or CXCL16 neutralization, alone or in combination, resulted in significant inhibition of patient-derived cancer cells migration to brain metastatic CAF aggregates, further supporting the importance of CXCL16 and CXCL12 in migration of CTCs into brain-associated microenvironment.CAFs have been shown to promote the growth of cancer cells via secreting various growth factors (EGF, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), FGF, Tranforming Growth Factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) etc), and to induce invasion and metastasis of cancer cells by production of CXCL12, MMP, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21). CXCL12 has been shown to play an important role in the attraction of CTCs towards future sites of metastasis, and CXCR4 (receptor for CXCL12) antagonism has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and decrease metastatic burden. CXCL16/CXCR6 interaction has also been shown to promote migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines, and recent studies published by Xiao et al. have shown that this axis can induce invasiveness based on the activation of the ERK1/2 and F-actin pathways. While these previous studies explored the role of these chemokine axes within cell lines and the primary TME, none of these prior investigations examined or identified the source of the chemokines within the metastatic TME. Our findings confirm the clinical significance of CXCL12 and CXCL16 in the formation of brain metastatic niche, and point to CAFs as the primary source for these chemokines.In summary, this is the first report demonstrating the expression of both CXCL16 and CXCL12 in CAFs derived from human breast cancer metastasis in the brain. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody directed against CXCL16, alone or in combination with CXCR4 antagonist, significantly inhibited the migration of patient-derived breast cancer cells in our 3D CAF aggregate system. The unique expression of CXCL16 by brain metastasis CAFs provides an important area of cancer research that will further our understanding of metastatic progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the specific role of CAFs on metastatic progression, and possible strategies to target chemokine interactions to prevent the migration of circulating breast cancer cells to the brain.Materials and methodsCulturing patient-derived cancer cells and fibroblastsNormal breast, primary, and brain metastatic tumor tissues were obtained from patients treated at City of Hope according to guidelines approved by the City of Hope Institutional Review Board. Tissues were mechanically dissociated into small fragments (\u22641\u2009mm diameter), and cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates (Fischer Scientific) with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) media (D10) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the generation of human breast CAFs, breast tumor fragments were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (D10 medium), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and L\u2010glutamine (Invitrogen). To promote adherence of tumor fragments, tissue culture plates were coated with 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). CAF cultures can be passaged for up to 4 weeks, and can be frozen for later use while maintaining their mesenchyme-derived surface markers consistenly. However, to maintain similar CAF characteristics in culture, isolated CAFs were passaged no more than four times for these experiments. Breast cancer cells were cultured in calcium-free DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS, cholera toxin (10\u2009ng/mL), bovine insulin (60\u2009ug/mL), hydrocortisone (0.5\u2009ug/mL), epidermal growth factor (20\u2009ng/mL), penicillin/stremptomycin, and L-Glutamine.Generation of patient-derived 3D aggregateTo generate normal, primary and metastatic patient-derived 3D aggregates, cancer or stromal cells were centrifuged at 1300\u2009RPM for 5\u2009min into pellets in 1.5\u2009mL microcentrifuge tubes. After removal of the supernatant, aggregates were retrieved using micropipette tips (approximately 10\u2009ul), and expelled onto nucleopore filter membrane (0.8\u2009\u00b5m pore size; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) floating on gel foam inserts (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) supplemented with D10 medium. Following 2\u20134 weeks, patient-derived aggregates were harvested in culture, and utilized for downstream experimentation, and analysis in both the hydrogel migration assay and immunohistochemistry.Chromogenic immunohistochemistryThe composition of the extracellular matrix and collagen architecture was examined by chromogenic immunohistochemistry. Three-micrometer paraffin embedded sections of tissues or aggregates were deparaffinized in xylene, and subsequently rehydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed utilizing a 1\u00d7 DIVA citrate buffer (pH\u2009=\u20096.0) in a Biocare Decloaker (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) for 30\u2009s at 125\u2009\u00b0C, then 3.5\u2009min at 90\u2009\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were incubated on the tissue or aggregate sections for 1\u2009h: \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (mouse monoclonal clone 1A4) and vimentin (mouse monoclonal clone V9), both from Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA; Collagen IV (Mouse monoclonal Col94), Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA, USA, Fibronectin (mouse monoclonal sc-271098), Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); and FAP (Rabbit polyclonal clone AB2), Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA. Based upon the species of each primary antibody, the following secondary antibodies were incubated on the tissue or aggregate of interest for 20\u2009min: MACH 2 Mouse HRP-polymer (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) or MACH 2 Rabbit HRP-polymer. Following incubation and a rinse in Tris-Buffered Saline solution buffer, the DAB Chromogen Kit from Biocare Medical was used to illustrate the marker of interest.Fluorescent immunohistochemistryPatient-derived aggregates and tissue sections were paraffin embedded, and de-paraffinized in Xylene. Anti-Cytokeratin (mouse monoconal), and Vimentin (mouse monoclonal clone V9) antibodies were purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA, USA), anti-Ki67 (rabbit monoclonal) antibody was purchased from Biocare (Concord, CA, USA). The fluorophores Cy3, FITC, and Alexa 647 conjugates were used at a concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Biocare). Imaging was performed through the Zeiss Axio Observer. The chemokine composition of the patient-derived aggregate was identified by using primary antibodies on the tissue or aggregate of interest for 1\u2009h: Vimentin (mouse monoclonal clone V9), SDF-1 (rabbit monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and the CXCL16 (rabbit monoclonal; abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).Histological and immunofluorescent microscopyImaging of the 3\u2009\u03bcm formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues and aggregates were performed using an Olympus BX51WI fixed-stage upright microscope equipped with the Vectra platform (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Immunofluorescent imaging of the hydrogel assay was performed utilizing a Zeiss Axiovert 200\u2009M-wide field fluorescence microscope equipped with the RTE CCD 1300-XHS camera.Fluorescent cell membrane labelingTo elucidate and differentiate both the cancer and stromal cells migrating within the hydrogel, PKH26 Red Fluorescent membrane stain (Sigma Aldrich) was used to stain stromal cells, and PKH67 Green Fluorescent membrane stain (Sigma Aldrich) was utilized to stain cancer cells. Both stromal and cancer cells numbering 1.0\u20132.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/mL were re-suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS. One-micromolar of either PKH67 green dye or PKH26 red dye was mixed with 500\u2009\u03bcl of Diluent C to a single cell suspension in a 2\u2009mL centrifuge tube in which 0.5\u2009\u03bcM PKH26/67 final dye concentration was used. The cells were then incubated in the dark for 5\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Subsequent washing of the cells in 800\u2009\u03bcL of FBS quenched the staining reaction, and cell mixtures were pelleted via centrifugation at 1000\u2009RPM for 10\u2009min. Brain metastasis stromal cells were labeled blue with Wheat Germ Agglutinin, Alexa Fluor\u00ae 350 Conjugated from Invitrogen. The cells were incubated for 10\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C at a starting concentration of 5.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL, then washed twice in HBSS buffer. Following two washes in HBSS buffer, cells are pelleted, and placed onto the Millipore membrane filter /Foam system that served as the vehicle for the cells to form 3D aggregates.Hydrogel migration assayThe HyStem hydrogel kit (ESI-Bio) was utilized to create the proper scaffold for migration assays. Hydrogel is a hyaluronan-based gel that effectively crosslinks thio-reactive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, and was formulated according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions consisting of three components: thiol-modified hyaluronan (Glycosil\u00ae), Thiol-reactive PEGDA crosslinker (Extralink\u00ae), and thiol-modified collagen (Gelin-S\u00ae). Glycosil and Gelin were separately dissolved in 1.0\u2009mL of deionized water, and allowed to dissolve for 1\u2009h. The cross-link agent Extralink\u00ae was then dissolved with 0.5\u2009mL of deionized water. Following the solvation of Glycosil and Gelin-S, the compounds were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. To form the hydrogel, Extralink was added to the Glycosil\u2009+\u2009Gelin-S mixed in a 1:4 volume ratio. The heterogeneous mixture of Gelin-S, Glycosil, and Extralink were then added in 60\u2009uL aliquots to a 35\u2009mm tissue culture dish. Once the gel became opaque in appearance, D10 medium was added onto the gel and surrounding area. The dish was then placed in a humidified 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator with O2 and 10% CO2. The relative migration of PKH green-labeled cancer cells was measured to normal, primary, or metastatic patient aggregates that were labeled with PKH red. Furthermore, a heterogeneous aggregate composed of cancer cells combined with either brain metastatic stroma or primary stroma was created. The relative migration of cancer cells within the aggregate system was measured through both fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry.CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralization hydrogel migration assayCXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor (Selleckchem) and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody were prepared in a 1\u00d7 PBS (Dulbeccos\u2019s) at a stock concentration of 500\u2009mM. Cell lines or patient-specific cells were washed in 1\u00d7 PBS and re-suspended in 500\u2009\u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS supplemented with 100\u2009mM of Plerixafor and/or 0.25\u2009\u00b5g of anti-CXCL16 (purchased from Selleckchem and R & D Systems). The cancer cell-antagonist mixture was then incubated for 2\u2009h in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C with O2 and 10% CO2. The antagonized cells were then pelleted at 1200\u2009RPM for 5\u2009min, and utilized for downstream hydrogel-migration assays.RNA-seq library preparation and data analysisPatient-derived aggregates were mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, subsequently the aggregates\u2019 RNA was purified using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The purified RNA libraries were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the City of Hope Integrative Genomics Core. The RNA-seq sequence reads were aligned with Human genome (hg19) using open source RNA-seq alignment tool Tophat (v2.0.8b). The alignment results were converted to RNA-seq gene expression measurement as RPKM (reads/kilo base of total exon length/million mapped) using CLC Genomic Workbench, and normalized to gene models in the NCBI Ref Seq database. Maximum expression <0.05\u2009RPKM was used to filter and exclude very low expressing genes. An EDGE test was then utilized to compare the gene expression between sample groups. The EDGE method was developed specifically for two-group comparisons in situations where many features are studied simultaneously but only a few biological replicates are available for each of the experimental groups (i.e., RNA-seq). Following the EDGE test, significantly differentially expressed genes characterized as cytokines or growth factors were selected (Supplemental Table\u00a01).Growth factor expression in stroma by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from single cell suspensions utilizing an RNEasy RNA isolation kit from Qiagen. cDNA was prepared with a cDNA Super Script III RT kit (Thermo Scientific). For semi-quantitative PCR assays, Promega Master Mix was used to amplify growth factor genes. Cycling conditions consisted of a denaturation step for 5\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation (95\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min), annealing (72\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s) and extension (72\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min), with final elongation cycle of 10\u2009min at 72\u2009\u00b0C. Quantitative PCR was performed with BioRad CFX96 and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).The following primers for amplification for RT-qPCR of growth factors were:FGF1 forward: 5\u2032-CACATTCAGCTGCAGCTCAG-3\u2032FGF1 reverse: 5\u2032-TGCTTTCTGGCCATAGTGAGTC-3\u2032FGF2 forward: 5\u2032-CTTCTTCCTGCGCATCCACC-3\u2032FGF2 reverse: 5\u2032-CACATACCAACTGGTGTATTTC-3\u2032EGF forward: 5\u2032-TGGATGTGCTTGATAAGCGG-3\u2032EGF reverse: 5\u2032ACCATGTCCTTTCCAGTGTGT-3\u2032IGF-1 forward: 5\u2032-TGGATGCTCTTCAGTTCGTG-3\u2032IGF-1 reverse: 5\u2032-TGGTAGATGGGGGCTGATAC-3\u2032CXCL12 forward: 5\u2032-GGGCTCCTGGGTTTTGTATT-3\u2032CXCL12 reverse: 5\u2032-GTCCTGAGAGTCCTTTTGCG-3\u2032CXCL16 forward: 5\u2032-GGCCCACCAGAA GCATTTAC-3\u2032CXCL16 reverse: 5\u2032-CTGAAGATGCCCCCTCTGAG-3\u2032Human CXCL16 ELISAPatient-derived stromal cells were cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates. 1\u2009mL of media was collected from each well, and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

Within this subtype, invasive, stroma-rich tumours with infiltration of inflammatory cells are even more aggressive.

Here, we show that primary human monocytes have a survival advantage, proliferate in vivo and develop into immunosuppressive myeloid cells expressing the myeloid-derived suppressor cell marker S100A9 only in a TN breast cancer environment.

We propose that this migratory feedback loop amplifies the formation of a reactive stroma, contributing to the aggressive phenotype of TN breast tumours. These insights could help select more suitable therapies targeting the stromal component of these tumours, and could aid prediction of drug resistance. A reactive tumour stroma is associated with poor prognosis. Here, the authors show that in patients with triple negative breast cancer resident monocytes activate cancer-associated fibroblasts and induce production of CXCL16, which acts as a monocyte chemoattractant, resulting in an amplificatory feedback loop.Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women today and the prognosis is dependent not only on the stage of disease at detection, but also on the type of breast cancer. Breast cancers can be divided into several subtypes, mainly based on expression of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Using global gene expression profiling, breast cancers can be further categorized into molecular subtypes including the basal-like and luminal subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancers (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212; TNBC) constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. TNBCs are highly metastatic tumours with a poor prognosis and there are few treatment options for patients with these cancers. Infiltration of inflammatory cells or the presence of a stroma with reactive, invasive properties, have been associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC. Furthering our understanding of the role of the tumour stroma and inflammatory cells in TNBC will help elucidate how the tumour microenvironment may contribute to disease progression, drug resistance or may enable treatments to be tailored to patients more effectively.The tumour microenvironment is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-malignant stromal cells including fibroblasts, pericytes, immune cells and endothelial cells. The cells of the tumour microenvironment communicate via soluble mediators or intercellular receptor-ligand interactions. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), pericytes and innate immune cells, especially tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), are the main cell types constituting the tumour stroma. It is generally thought that CAFs are recruited from resident fibroblasts or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMDCs), or trans-differentiated from mesenchymal or tumour-derived cells. These cells are then activated by factors in the tumour microenvironment, such as TGF-\u03b2, to become myofibroblasts (\u03b1SMA+/vimentin+) that promote invasion and metastasis. How CAFs are recruited and activated is still under intense investigation.Monocytes are immune cells of the myeloid lineage that are plastic by nature and can give rise to macrophages, dendritic cells and probably also monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells, particularly TAMs and MDSCs negatively affect survival in breast cancer patients. This negative effect has been ascribed to their immunosuppressive roles and their effects on tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis. Both monocytes and BMDCs can promote metastasis to distant sites. We have previously shown that a subpopulation of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells (CD163+) is present in the tumour stroma of TN breast tumours and is associated with unfavourable clinicopathologic features. However, the effects of myeloid cells on stroma formation in TN breast tumours have not been investigated in detail.Stroma interactions and the effects on tumour development and progression are complex, and it is therefore important to understand the intricate networks within specific tumour types and the cells of their particular tumour microenvironment. In 2011, Elkabets et al. showed that mouse BMDCs could promote stroma formation in TNBCs, specifically by recruitment or activation of non-bone marrow-derived fibroblasts via secreted granulin (GRN). Using the same human breast cancer cohort as Elkabets et al., we have shown that the presence of myeloid CD163+ cells in the stromal areas of human TN breast tumours specifically correlates with these GRN expressing cells.In this study, we investigated whether myeloid cells could affect stroma formation in breast cancer. We show that primary human monocytes, co-transplanted with either luminal A or TNBC cells in highly immunodeficient NSG-mice, differentiated into CD163+ myeloid cells and promoted an increased stroma formation in both tumour types. However, only the TNBC/monocyte co-transplants developed immunosuppressive CD163+ myeloid cells, and were able to activate fibroblasts. The findings were validated in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) as well as syngeneic breast cancer models of luminal and TNBC. Interestingly, we also found that the monocyte chemoattractant CXCL16 was induced in primary fibroblasts cultured under TNBC/monocyte conditions in vitro. In line with these data, primary CAFs isolated from TN tumours specifically expressed CXCL16, a finding that was supported by analysis of a human breast cancer RNAseq data set and a human breast cancer tissue microarray. Our data indicate that in a TNBC environment, myeloid cells can activate the stromal fibroblasts to express CXCL16 that, in turn, recruits more myeloid cells and fibroblasts. On the basis of these findings, we propose that drugs targeted at immunosuppressive myeloid cells, or the circuits mediated by them, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs, should be investigated to treat TN breast tumours. Our findings will be important for predicting drug resistance and outcome in patients treated with drugs targeting tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the future.ResultsImmunosuppressive myeloid cells in TNBC xenograftsTo investigate whether myeloid cells can promote stroma formation in TN tumours, or if the stroma of TN tumours secretes factors that attract CD163+ myeloid cells, we first generated breast cancer xenograft models. To that end, we co-xenotransplanted primary human monocytes (Mo; the proposed precursors of CD163+ myeloid cells) from healthy blood donors together with human breast cancer cells of the luminal A (MCF-7 or T47D cells) or TN (MDA-MB-231 or SUM-159 cells) subtypes in highly immunodeficient NSG-mice. These cell lines were chosen since they lack endogenous expression of the myeloid-derived suppressor cell marker, S100A9 (ref.), and the NSG-mice were chosen since they are deficient in T-, B- and NK-cells and also have defective macrophages and dendritic cells, but allow engraftment of functional human myeloid cells.Tumours that formed were excised, and their biological characteristics, their myeloid cell content and stroma formation were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Grafted monocytes (expression of human myeloid markers CD11b and CD163 and very weak expression of human macrophage marker CD68; Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2A) were present in the xenografts at the time of dissection (day 21 for MDA-MB-231, T47D and SUM-159 grafts; day 21 and day 90 for MCF-7 grafts). The presence of CD163+ or CD68+ cells was significantly higher in TN as compared with luminal A xenografts (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The luminal T47D/monocyte grafts showed the lowest density of CD11b+ cells and lacked CD163+ cells, whereas the TN SUM-159/monocyte grafts had the highest density of CD163+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, mouse macrophages (F4/80 staining Supplementary Fig. 2B), human myeloid dendritic cells (CD208) and human fibroblasts (CD90) were all absent (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Gr-1, a mouse myeloid cell marker, was present only at low levels in some xenograft sections (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Of importance, the myeloid-derived suppressor cell marker S100A9 was expressed solely in the myeloid cells that had been co-transplanted with TNBC cells (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), indicating that these transplanted myeloid cells had acquired an immunosuppressive character (Figs 1, 2a, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2A).Vimentin is normally expressed by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, but not by MCF-7 cells. In the MCF-7 co-transplants, the vimentin staining is predominantly in the co-transplanted myeloid cells (Fig. 1), as supported by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 3A), IHC (Supplementary Fig. 3B) and western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 3C). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 monocyte co-transplants had slightly increased levels of the mouse endothelial marker CD34, suggesting that monocytes promote angiogenesis equally well in luminal A and TN breast xenografts (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data suggest that grafted monocytes survive transplantation in both luminal A and TN breast xenografts. However, myeloid cells were numerous in the TN xenotransplants and expressed the myeloid immunosuppressive marker, S100A9, only in the TN xenotransplants.Monocytes survive and proliferate in a TNBC environmentWe next investigated why the proportion of CD11b+CD163+ myeloid cells was high in the TN co-transplant tumours. In general, the monocyte co-transplanted tumours were smaller than the corresponding tumour cell-only transplants, and in one case even failed to grow (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) with the exception of the TN SUM-159 co-transplants that increased significantly in size in the presence of monocytes (Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 3a,b). We used the Ki67 proliferation marker to show that the monocytes in the TN, but not the luminal tumours, were actively proliferating (Fig. 3c). This observation was supported by the fact that primary human monocytes proliferated when cultured in conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 or SUM-159 cells, but did not proliferate in MCF-7- or T47D-conditioned medium as compared with control medium (Fig. 3d). Conditioned medium from a third TN cell line (MDA-MB-468 cells) did not induce monocyte proliferation (Fig. 3d). To evaluate monocyte survival in different tumour microenvironments, we cultured primary human monocytes in conditioned medium from five different breast cancer cell lines; three TN (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159) and two luminal A (MCF-7 and T47D). Indeed, survival of monocytes was significantly increased in the TNBC supernatant cultures, as measured by staining with the apoptosis markers annexin V and 7AAD, compared with in the luminal A breast cancer conditioned medium cultures (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 4A). As we have shown previously, both primary human monocytes and M2 macrophages migrated significantly more towards conditioned medium from TN cells than from luminal A cells (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 4B). Hence, our data indicate that the TN tumour microenvironment promotes increased survival and proliferation of co-transplanted myeloid cells.Soluble mediators in monocyte and TNBC cell co-culturesTo search for soluble factors that might be critical for the increased monocyte survival and proliferation in the TN grafts, we compared proteome arrays conducted on supernatants collected before and after co-culture with monocytes, using either TN (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and SUM-159) or luminal A (MCF-7 and T47D) breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 4C\u2013E). The TNBC cell line supernatants collected before monocyte co-cultures showed a typical expression pattern of chemokines, angiogenesis and invasion related proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4C; purple box), whereas the luminal A breast cancer cells (blue box) expressed fewer factors. The proteins that were more upregulated in TNBC cell lines/monocyte co-cultures than in luminal A/monocyte co-cultures were GM-CSF, MMP9, endothelin-1 and CXCL4 (platelet factor 4), and as shown previously, levels of IL-8 and CCL2 increased when monocytes were added to the TN breast cell lines and T47D cells (Supplementary Fig. 4D,E; green and pink box). Thus, the TN tumour cell environment, alone or together with monocytes, harbour important myeloid cell survival, proliferation and differentiation factors.Monocytes induce stroma formationTo examine whether co-transplanted monocytes would affect stroma formation or activation, we next analysed the stromal component of the tumour xenografts. Recruited cells of mouse origin were present in all xenografts (mouse \u03b22-microglobulin staining; Fig. 2), but the TN co-transplants had the highest number of recruited mouse cells (Supplementary Table 1). The recruited cells were of fibroblast origin since they expressed the fibroblast marker PDGFR\u03b2 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).As activated fibroblasts are central players in the tumour microenvironment we also analysed whether the stromal fibroblasts were activated in the tumours using the marker \u03b1SMA (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). MCF-7 and T47D tumours that had been co-transplanted with monocytes showed a very modest, if any increase in fibroblast \u03b1SMA expression (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). By contrast, the MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 tumours that had been co-transplanted with monocytes showed a major increase in fibroblast \u03b1SMA expression (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These fibroblasts also showed the typical spindle shaped morphology in the TN reactive stroma (Fig. 2). Since the \u03b1SMA antibody recognizes both human and mouse \u03b1SMA, we co-stained with the human myeloid cell markers CD163 as well (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Most \u03b1SMA+ cells were CD163 negative and therefore of mouse origin (black arrows), although a few of the \u03b1SMA+ cells were of human origin and stained positive for CD163 (green arrows; Supplementary Fig. 5A). The \u03b1SMA+ cells did not stain for the mouse myeloid marker Gr-1 (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Altogether, this indicates that the majority of \u03b1SMA+ cells are activated mouse fibroblasts, and that they are significantly increased in the TN xenografts co-transplanted with monocytes.The tumour stroma in TN PDX and syngeneic modelsTo verify that our findings were applicable in other preclinical models, we next generated PDXs using tumour tissue from one luminal (HCI-011) and four TN (HCI-001, 002, 004 and 010) breast cancers (Fig. 4). We also generated syngeneic mouse tumours from one luminal (67NR) and one TN (4T1.13) breast cancer cell line (Supplementary Fig. 5B,C). As indicated in Fig. 4, there were significantly more myeloid cells of mouse origin (Ly6C; Fig. 4a,b), significantly more S100A9-expressing cells of mouse origin (Fig. 4a,b) and significantly more activated fibroblasts as indicated by the increased \u03b1SMA staining (Fig. 4a,b) in the TN PDX grafts as compared with the luminal PDX graft.Similarly, Ly6C, mouse S100A9 and \u03b1SMA expression were increased in the TN as compared with the luminal grafts in the syngeneic model systems (Supplementary Fig. 5B,C). The increased expression of S100A9 in the TN grafts has previously been reported to associate with an increased metastatic property in the TN 4T1.2 as compared with luminal 67NR grafts. Indeed, when mRNA expression profiles of the syngeneic grafts were analysed, also ACTA2 (\u03b1SMA) was significantly increased in whole tumour all exon array data of 4T1.2 versus 67NR tumours (Supplementary Table 3). S100A9 mRNA was not upregulated in vitro, a finding that might indicate in vivo requirements for S100A9 expression or be explained by its post-transcriptional regulation.Less classical collagen depositions in TN xenograftsCollagen is the major component of the ECM and the tumour microenvironment actively promotes degradation and re-deposition of collagen to promote tumour progression. Collagens can be divided into fibrillar (for example, Type I, II, III, V) and non-fibrillar collagens (for example, Type IV and VI). Collagen IV is a basement membrane collagen and collagen VI is a beaded filament-forming non-classical collagen that is associated with ECM. The main collagens present in tumours are Type I, III, IV and VI (refs). Myeloid cells play an important role in the ECM remodelling by producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade collagen.To investigate the effects of co-transplanted myeloid cells on the collagen content in our xenografts, we used the Sirius Red stain (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs 1 and 6A,B). Under bright field microscopy (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs 1 and 6A,B) Sirius Red detects collagens of type (I, III and IV) and using polarized birefringent light microscopy only collagens of type I and III are detected (red/green/yellowish staining; Supplementary Fig. 6A,B). We found that, co-transplantation of monocytes slightly increased the collagen deposition in all of the grafts (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs 1 and 6A,B). The MCF-7/monocyte co-transplants on day 21 and day 90 showed robust collagen deposition (Supplementary Table 1; red colour, Fig. 2 (day 90); red colour and green/yellow, Supplementary Fig. 6A,B (day 21 and 90)). The T47D/monocyte co-transplants showed a similar collagen deposition (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), whereas the TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte co-transplants showed a larger variation between tumours (25\u201375% stroma Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; red colour, Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2A). Interestingly, despite the high number of fibroblasts in the TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte xenografts (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), they expressed significantly less collagens of type I and III, compared with the MCF-7/monocyte and T47D/monocyte co-transplants (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; red/green/yellowish pictures; Supplementary Fig. 6A,B). A low expression of collagens type I and III in TNBCs, specifically, was also verified in a tissue microarray consisting of 144 human breast cancers, where a low birefringent light of Sirius Red viewed in polarized light correlated significantly to TN breast tumours (Table 1; P=0.036). Bright light Sirius Red staining of collagen deposition did not correlate to TNBCs, but showed a negative correlation to both tumour size (P=0.003) and Nottingham histologic grade (NHG) status (P=0.002) (Table 1); Spearman's Rho analysis using SPSS software.The non-classical beaded filament collagen VI was expressed primarily in the TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte xenografts, but also to some extent in the SUM-159 xenografts (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Fig. 7A). The collagen VI deposits in the MDA-MB-231/monocyte xenografts probably came from the transplanted myeloid cells, since primary human monocytes cultured in conditioned medium from TN MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, but not MCF-7 and interestingly not SUM-159 breast cancer cells, upregulate collagen VI to a similar level as the control M2 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 7B,C). Primary mouse fibroblasts cultured in conditioned medium from breast cancer cells, or from co-cultures of breast cancer cells and primary monocytes, did not express more collagen VI than mouse fibroblasts grown in normal medium (Supplementary Fig. 7B,C). Monocytes cultured in conditioned medium from the luminal T47D breast cancer cells also induced collagen VI, indicating that it might be a more general breast cancer cell inducing mechanism, unrelated to the TNBC subtype (Supplementary Fig. 7B,C).These findings suggest that the tumour type will direct the myeloid cells differently in TN as compared with luminal A tumours, so that myeloid cells will produce both collagen degrading MMPs and perhaps also anti-inflammatory collagen VI in TN tumours, thus promoting their invasiveness. Thus, although the TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte co-transplants had more fibroblasts as judged by IHC (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1) these fibroblasts did not produce more of the classical collagens.Primary fibroblasts are activated by monocytes in TN tumoursWe next investigated what might facilitate the high number of mouse fibroblasts seen in the TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte co-transplants. To this end, we performed primary mouse fibroblast migration, survival and proliferation assays in vitro, to compare the effect of TN/monocyte and luminal/monocyte conditioned medium.Scratch wound assays revealed that primary mouse fibroblasts migrated equally well in supernatants from all culture conditions (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7D), while a significant survival advantage was seen only in the primary mouse fibroblasts cultured in TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte supernatant (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 7E). Increased proliferation of mouse fibroblasts was seen in MCF-7/monocyte, MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159 or SUM-159/monocyte cultures (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 7F), but not in T47D/monocyte or MDA-MB-468/monocyte co-cultures (Supplementary Fig. 7F). These data indicate that fibroblast survival is probably the major cause of the increased presence of fibroblasts in the TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte and SUM-159/monocyte grafts, but that fibroblast proliferation also can be affected significantly by myeloid cells.The activation status of cultured primary mouse fibroblasts was then investigated by measuring fibroblast activating protein (FAP) levels. Interestingly, we found that primary mouse fibroblasts were activated by all of the TNBC cell/monocyte supernatants, as seen by upregulation of FAP at both mRNA (Fig. 5d) and protein (Fig. 5e) levels, further corroborating our \u03b1SMA data presented in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1. The luminal T47D/monocyte supernatants also upregulated fibroblast FAP mRNA (Fig. 5d), while fibroblast TGF\u03b2 mRNA was induced slightly only by culture in the MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium (Supplementary Fig. 7G). The low numbers of myeloid cells surviving in the luminal T47D xenografts may explain why fibroblast activation was affected only in the in vitro cultures of T47D/monocytes supernatants, but not in the corresponding tumours.Fibroblasts in TN tumours produce CXCL16 specificallyIn the experiments mentioned above, we showed that monocytes can promote stroma formation equally well in TN and luminal A tumours, but that the activated fibroblasts are numerous in the TN tumours. This does not explain why CD163+ myeloid cells are more frequent in the stromal areas of TN breast tumours, as we published previously. We therefore looked for myeloid cell chemoattractants that would be produced specifically in fibroblasts from TN breast tumours. We first isolated primary human CAFs from ER\u2212 (TN) and ER+ breast tumour patient samples, cultured them in vitro and collected the supernatants. We subsequently performed an angiogenesis protein array and found that CXCL16, amphiregulin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP1) were expressed at high levels in the TN but not the ER+ breast cancer CAF supernatants (red box; Fig. 6a). CXCL16 is known to be a T cell chemoattractant, but recently also as a myeloid cell chemoattractant. Amphiregulin is a protein involved in tumour progression and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases act to inhibit MMPs. IHC of CXCL16 on primary breast tumours revealed that both ER+ and TN tumour cells expressed CXCL16 (black arrow; Fig. 6b), and that fibroblasts in the TN tumour also expressed CXCL16 (red arrow; Fig. 6b).We next evaluated the levels of secreted CXCL16 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on supernatants from primary CAFs and showed that CAFs isolated from TN tumours (3/4) secreted high amounts of CXCL16, while low CXCL16 was measured in CAFs isolated from ER+ tumours (0/8) (Fig. 6c). IHC staining of CXCL16 in a tumour tissue microarray consisting of 144 human breast cancers showed that high fibroblast expression of CXCL16, correlated significantly to TN breast tumours (P=0.010), while CXCL16 expression in the malignant cells per se did not (Table 1). However, only a fraction of the TN tumours expressed CXCL16 in the fibroblasts (Table 2). The high fibroblast CXCL16 expression also correlated to a low birefringent light of Sirius Red (P=0.013; Table 1). Boyden chamber migration experiments showed that monocytes (Fig. 6d left) and, to a lesser extent, M2 macrophages (Fig. 6d, right) migrated towards CXCL16 more so than towards another chemokine, CXCL12. We also observed a significant monocyte migration towards ER\u2212 (TN) CAF supernatants (Fig. 6e). The hematoxylin eosin (HE) image (Fig. 6e, right) shows a cytospin of the migrated cells. In support of these findings, we also found that expression of CXCL16 mRNA was induced in activated primary mouse fibroblasts cultured in TN MDA-MB-231/monocyte or MDA-MB-468/monocyte conditioned medium, but not in conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-468 cell culture without monocytes, nor the luminal cell supernatants (Fig. 6f). The TN SUM-159/monocyte supernatant also increased CXCL16 mRNA expression significantly, as did the SUM-159 only supernatants (Fig. 6f). Using PDX models, mouse CXCL16 mRNA originating from infiltrating mouse cells was significantly induced in one of the TN PDX grafts, and increased in the other three TN PDX grafts, as compared with the luminal PDX graft (Fig. 6g). Finally, in the syngeneic models CXCL16 mRNA was significantly increased in whole tumour all exon array data of 4T1.2 versus 67NR tumours (Supplementary Table 3). Since CXCL16 can attract T cells, NKT cells, myeloid cells and also fibroblast precursors, these findings are of large importance when it comes to understanding why the tumour stroma in TN breast tumours in particular, attracts immune cells.Immunosuppressive gene expression profile in TNBCsTo extend our findings from our preclinical models to primary human breast tumours, we analysed RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The tumours were sub-grouped based on the PAM50 centroids and here the basal subgroup largely coincides with TN tumours. While mRNA encoding the myeloid cell marker CD11b (ITGAM) was expressed at equal levels in all breast tumour subgroups (Fig. 7a), mRNA of the anti-inflammatory markers CD163 and S100A9 were expressed at significantly higher levels in basal than luminal A breast tumours (Fig. 7a). Also, the collagen VI (COL6A1)/collagen I (COL1A1) mRNA ratio (COL6A1/COL1A1) was significantly higher in basal than luminal A breast tumours (Fig. 7a). Further corroborating our findings, we found that mRNAs for CXCL16 as well as for IL8, CSF2, MMP9, EDN1 and CCL2 all were expressed at significantly higher levels in basal-like breast cancers as compared with luminal A tumours (Fig. 7a).DiscussionIn this study, we demonstrate that co-transplanted primary human monocytes differentiate into CD163+ myeloid cells, both in luminal A and TN breast tumour grafts, but that the immunosuppressive MDSC-marker S100A9 (refs) was expressed only by the CD163+ cells in the TN grafts. S100A9 expression has previously been associated with ER\u2212PR\u2212 tumours, both when expressed in the myeloid cells but also in the malignant cells per se. Neither MDA-MB-231 nor SUM-159 cells express S100A9, thus making it possible for us to investigate the myeloid S100A9 expression, in a TN environment in vivo. More myeloid cells were present in the TN tumours and this was due to their increased survival and proliferation. Hence, the TN tumour environment is crucial for myeloid cells and their effect on fibroblasts. We also showed that monocytes are preferentially attracted to TN breast tumours by secreted factors, such as GM-CSF, CCL2 and IL-8, confirming the findings of Hollm\u00e9n et al. and Su et al.. In addition, S100A9 is probably one of the major MDSC chemoattractants. Even though expression of the mouse myeloid differentiation antigen Gr-1 was scarce, a potential infiltration of immature BMDCs cannot be excluded as NSG-mice still have normal numbers of immature myeloid cells. Furthermore, the xenograft models used in this study represent a situation where the myeloid cells are present in the tumours from initiation and hence, these models do not address the question how these cells are recruited to the tumours or which cells of the microenvironment that arrive first. Therefore, we confirmed our data in mice grafted with TN as compared with luminal patient-derived tumour tissue (PDX), where we could see that more myeloid cells infiltrated the TN tumours, and although the infiltrating myeloid cells were located closer to the borders of the tumours, these areas did show more S100A9 expression and activated fibroblasts (\u03b1SMA) in the TN, as compared with the luminal graft. We observed a similar pattern using syngeneic mouse models of luminal (67NR) as compared with TN (4T1) breast tumours, grafted in immunocompetent mice. The effect of myeloid cells on tumour stroma formation was seen in the borders of grafts in general, and therefore might be underestimated in human tumour pathology. In our model where the myeloid cells were mixed with the tumour cells prior to injection, a clear effect was seen throughout the tumour, on both activated fibroblasts and myeloid cells per se. In the future, we suggest validating our findings in spontaneous breast cancer models with transplanted circulating human myeloid cells, but also in models using novel drugs against tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells.Monocytes have been previously shown to promote metastasis but evidence is lacking on how they affect the tumour stroma. We showed that the myeloid cells in both luminal A and TN tumours enhanced recruitment of fibroblasts of mouse origin, but promoted their activation into myofibroblasts only in the context of TN tumours. Monocytes per se had the potential to activate the fibroblasts in the TN tumours and to induce an alternative collagen (collagen VI) formation. Hence, monocytes can promote stroma formation in both luminal A and TNBCs, but the type of stroma potentiated by the myeloid cells might depend on the tumour type. It is intriguing to note that in 3 out of 4 xenograft-groups, the monocyte co-transplanted tumours were smaller in size, a finding that might be explained by a different ECM in these tumours and the levels of MMPs (for example, MMP9) that can dictate the thickness of collagen deposition and also the orientation of collagen fibres. Collagen VI, which is induced by TGF\u03b2 in macrophages, is not preferentially degraded by MMPs. It has also been shown to be a fibroblast mitogen and suggested to be involved in drug resistance, tumour progression and myeloid cell recruitment.The beaded microfilament structure of collagen VI is also important for anchoring cells to the ECM and may be important for anchoring myeloid cells. Undoubtedly, more research on the role for different collagens in tumour progression is warranted.CXCL16 has previously been shown to attract T cells, bone marrow-derived fibroblast precursors and to potentiate fibrosis and myofibroblast activation in renal fibrosis. In this study we show that monocyte-induced fibroblast activation involves expression of the chemoattractant CXCL16 in a TN context primarily. This observation is supported by our findings that primary human CAFs from TN breast tumours specifically expressed CXCL16 and that a high CXCL16 expression in fibroblasts correlates with a TN breast tumour type in a breast cancer tissue microarray. The CXCL16 expression levels varied, and not all TN breast tumours expressed CXCL16 in their fibroblasts, an observation that might be explained by the heterogeneity within the TN subgroup and indeed when analysed using the TCGA breast cancer RNAseq data, only the basal breast cancer subgroup showed a significantly higher expression level of CXCL16. We also found that CXCL16 could be expressed by the malignant cells of both luminal A and TN tumours, a finding that might explain why CD163+/GRN+ myeloid cells are located in the tumour nests of luminal A tumours. In light of this, we suggest that CXCL16 may be viewed as a monocyte and fibroblast chemoattractant expressed in human breast tumours. In addition to this, also GM-CSF (ref.) and CXCL4 (refs) are important for fibroblast recruitment or activation. Similarly, Su et al. and Hollm\u00e9n et al. reported on a positive feedback loop between breast cancer cells and macrophages in mesenchymal-like and TNBCs.In summary, the findings from our study indicate that myeloid cells are recruited preferentially to TN breast tumours where they become skewed to immunosuppressive myeloid cells (CD163+S100A9+), activate CAFs and induce expression of CXCL16 in CAFs that in turn can recruit more myeloid cells and fibroblasts, but also T cells (Fig. 7b). This is the first study to address the particular effects of myeloid cells on tumour stroma, and also specifically with regards to breast cancer subtype. These findings are of particular importance for the design of trials concerning novel drugs being developed against tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells. In addition, our data add valuable information to aid management decisions concerning which drugs to be used in different breast cancer subtypes and also to predict drug resistance since anti-PD1/L1 resistant tumours might develop immune resistance in the presence of infiltrating anti-inflammatory myeloid cells. Our data suggest that patients with TNBCs, in particular, might benefit from treatment with novel immunomodulatory drugs or chemotherapeutics that target immunosuppressive cells.MethodsEthics statementPermission for the study was obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee at Lund University. For permission to conduct human research, the following ethics permits were obtained: Dnr 2010/477, Dnr 2012/689, Dnr 2014/669, Dnr 445/07 and Dnr 2009/658. The participating patients provided written informed consent or for the tumour tissue microarray had the option to withdraw. The NSG models (approvals M249-09 and M69/11) and nude mice (approval M149/14), were approved by regional ethics committee for animal research at Lund University, Sweden. The PDX experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The syngeneic, mouse breast cancer models, were approved by the Animal Experimentation and Ethics Committee (AEEC) of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Australia.Isolation of primary human monocytesLeucocytes were isolated within 2\u20133\u2009h of blood collection from healthy blood donors by leucocyte depletion filtration performed according to a previously published method or from blood collected in EDTA tubes from healthy blood donors. First, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared using Ficoll-Paque PLUS gradient centrifugation, then monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting using the Monocyte Isolation Kit II, according to the manufacturers' instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) with antibodies against CD3, CD7, CD16, CD19, CD56, CD123 and glycophorin A.Animal proceduresFemale 8-week-old NSG-mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1Wji)/SzJ strain, The Jackson Laboratory, Maine, USA) were housed in a controlled environment and all procedures were approved by the regional ethics committee for animal research at Lund University, Sweden (approvals M249-09 and M69/11). MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, T47D or SUM-159 human breast cancer cell lines (1 \u00d7 106 cells, 5 \u00d7 106 for T47D cells) were injected alone or in combination with primary human monocytes (1 \u00d7 106 cells) that were pre-stimulated with interleukin-10 (IL-10) 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 for 30\u2009min in a total volume of 100\u2009\u03bcl Hanks' balanced salt solution to enhance survival, on the right flank. Mice were monitored twice weekly. Tumours were excised either 21 days (MDA-MB-231, T47D, SUM-159 and MCF-7) or 21 and 90 days (MCF-7) after injection, before being fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. For each experiment, 5\u201310 mice were used in each group. Similar results were obtained with MCF-7 grafts on day 21 and 90; results for day 90 are shown in Figs 1 and 2 and for day 21 in Supplementary Fig. 6.NMRI-Nude mice (8-week-old) (The Jackson Laboratory Maine, USA) were housed in a controlled environment and all procedures were approved by the regional ethics committee for animal research (approval M149/14). Primary mouse fibroblasts were isolated by dissecting the ears of nude mice, cutting them into small pieces and treating overnight with collagenase type I (17100-017, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) together with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 1% minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM) at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The following day a single cell suspension was prepared, filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm pore filter, washed and cultured in HAMs F12 medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS. Subsequently, non-adherent cells were washed away.Patient-derived xenograftsBreast cancer PDXs were generated from one luminal (HCI-011) and four TN (HCI-001, HCI-002, HCI-004, HCI- 010) breast cancers serially passaged in NOD/SCID mice as described previously. Tumour fragments were placed into cleared inguinal fat pads of pre-pubescent NOD/SCID mice, grown to 20\u201325\u2009mm and subsequently dissected and stored by freezing in 90% FBS and 10% dimethylsulfoxide until used or fixed in paraffin for IHC. Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturers' instructions using RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, MD, USA) and iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-QPCR (BIO-RAD) was used for cDNA synthesis. RT-QPCR was performed using iTAG Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD).Syngeneic mouse breast cancer modelsSyngeneic primary tumours that were generated previously by injection of 1 \u00d7 105 luminal (67NR) or TN (4T1.13) cells in the fourth inguinal fat pad of 8\u201310-week-old female BALB/c mice were used for IHC.Cell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 and T47D were obtained from ATCC, and cultured in 10% FBS RPMI-1640 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. The SUM-159 cell line was produced by Professor S. Ethier and were cultured in F-12 HAM's medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 1\u2009\u03bcM L-Glutamine, 1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 hydrocortisone (BD BioScience, San Diego, CA, USA) and 5\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 insulin (Novo Nordisk A/S, M\u00e5l\u00f6v, Denmark) and penicillin/streptomycin. The cell lines were routinely tested and found negative for mycoplasma. Conditioned medium from all cell lines was collected at subconfluency and human primary monocytes were cultured for 7\u201314 days in the conditioned medium (OptiMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin or RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin) or using only medium with 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 rhGM-CSF as control. Human primary M2 macrophages were cultured in OptiMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 rhGM-CSF for 5 days, after which 20\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 rhIL-4 was added for another 2 days. All media and supplements were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Logan, UT, USA).TMA and immunohistochemistryThe breast cancer cohort consists of 144 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Malm\u00f6, Sweden, between 2001 and 2002. The cohort and TMA have previously been described in detail. CXCL16 cytoplasmic expression was estimated in the malignant cells (intensity: 0=negative, 1= weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong intensity) and in the stromal fibroblasts (intensity 0=negative-weak, 1=strong intensity). Sections (4\u2009\u03bcm thick) of the paraffin embedded tumours were mounted onto glass slides and deparaffinized, prior to antigen retrieval using the PT-link system (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) and staining in a Autostainer Plus (DAKO) with the EnVisionFlex High pH-kit (DAKO). All histological sections were counterstained with HE. All primary antibodies used for IHC are shown in Supplementary Table 4 (specificity; clone; dilution; company). Sirius Red staining was performed using in house methods. Cytospins were prepared from monocytes or non-enzymatic cell dissociation buffer-collected (Sigma Aldrich) M2 cultures that were air-dried.Cytokines and other reagentsAll recombinant human cytokines were obtained from R&D Systems, and the following concentrations were used in all experiments: 10\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 GM-CSF, 20\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 IL-4, 100\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 CXCL12 and 100\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 CXCL16. For flow cytometry, the following reagents were used (all from BD Biosciences): CD14 clone M5E2, HLA-DR clone G46-6, CD90, EpCAM, CD11b, CD34 annexin V and 7AAD.The human angiogenesis array Proteome Profiler kit (R&D systems) was used to analyse the soluble mediators according to the manufacturer's protocol. Analysis of CXCL16 in supernatants collected from primary human CAFs was performed using a human specific CXCL16 ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.CAF isolationPrimary human tumours were dissected, minced into smaller pieces and treated overnight with collagenase at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The next day, single cell suspensions were prepared and subsequently seeded into large flasks containing HAM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. After 12\u2009h the non-adherent cells were washed away and the adherent cells were continuously cultured in HAM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. The medium was changed every other day to remove non-adherent cells until large groups of fibroblasts became apparent. Collected supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C.Boyden chamber migration assaysHuman primary monocytes or M2 macrophages were allowed to migrate through Costar Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (pore size) 24-well plates (Corning; Sigma Aldrich) towards the conditioned medium of breast cancer cells (cultured under serum free conditions), or towards the chemokines CXCL12 or CXCL16 (100\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121).Scratch wound assaysFor the scratch wound assays, freshly prepared primary mouse fibroblasts were seeded directly into 6-well plates. Once confluent, a pipette tip was used to scratch the fibroblast monolayer with a total of two scratches per well. To start the assay, the wells were rinsed and conditioned medium applied. The area of the open wound was analysed after 24\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells were collected for quantitative real-time PCR (RT-QPCR) and supernatants were collected for ELISA analyses.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted according to the manufacturers' instructions using RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen, Hilden, MD, USA) for fibroblasts or Trizol (Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific) for monocytes. Random hexamers and the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase enzyme (Thermo Scientific) were used and RT-QPCR was performed in triplicate using Maxima SYBR Green/Rox (Thermo Scientific) and analysed on the Mx3005P QPCR system (Agilent Technologies). The relative mRNA expression was normalized to ACTB, HPRT and GAPDH and calculated using the comparative Ct method. For primers see Supplementary Table 5.Thymidine incorporationPrimary human monocytes or primary mouse fibroblasts were cultured in different breast cancer conditioned media and allowed to proliferate for 24\u2009h. [methyl-3H] thymidine (1\u2009\u03bcCi) was added for 18\u2009h, and incorporation was determined in a Microbeta Counter (Perkin & Elmer; MA, USA).Gene expression profile analysisTCGA breast cancer RNAseq data (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) were downloaded on 30 January 2015.

Furthermore, in a TN environment, the myeloid cells activate CAFs and induce expression of CXCL16 by the fibroblasts, which, in turn, can recruit more myeloid cells and fibroblasts. The activated stroma in combination with the presence of anti-inflammatory myeloid cells, will render the TN tumours a more aggressive behaviour.Analysisa of CXCL16 and Collagen expression in a breast cancer tissue microarray.\u00a0\tSirius Red\tLow birefringent Sirius Red (PL)\tCXCL16 malignant cells\tCXCL16 fibroblasts\t \tTNBC\t \t\u2003Correlation coefficient\t\u22120.142\t0.178*\t\u22120.025\t0.231**\t \t\u2003Sig.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

Thus, PFD has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.INTRODUCTIONCollagen, mainly produced by fibroblasts, is the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in the stroma. Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A.

Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted.

PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "title": "Exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 induces cancer-associated fibroblast-like properties in human breast fibroblasts.",
        "content": "It is established that the interaction between microenvironment and cancer cells has a critical role in tumor development, given the dependence of neoplastic cells on stromal support. However, how this communication promotes the activation of normal (NFs) into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is still not well understood. Most microRNA (miRNA) studies focused on tumor cell, but there is increasing evidence of their involvement in reprogramming NFs into CAFs. Here we show that miR-9, upregulated in various breast cancer cell lines and identified as pro-metastatic miRNA, affects the properties of human breast fibroblasts, enhancing the switch to CAF phenotype, thus contributing to tumor growth. Expressed at higher levels in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients, miR-9 improves indeed migration and invasion capabilities when transfected in immortalized NFs; viceversa, these properties are strongly impaired in CAFs upon miR-9 inhibition. We also demonstrate that tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake results in enhanced cell motility. Moreover, we observed that this miRNA is also secreted by fibroblasts and in turn able to alter tumor cell behavior, by modulating its direct target E-cadherin, and NFs themselves. Consistently with the biological effects observed, gene expression profiles of NFs upon transient transfection with miR-9 show the modulation of genes mainly involved in cell motility and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Finally, we were able to confirm the capability of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 to promote in vivo tumor growth.

        "full_text": "Exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 induces cancer-associated fibroblast-like properties in human breast fibroblastsIt is established that the interaction between microenvironment and cancer cells has a critical role in tumor development, given the dependence of neoplastic cells on stromal support. However, how this communication promotes the activation of normal (NFs) into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is still not well understood. Most microRNA (miRNA) studies focused on tumor cell, but there is increasing evidence of their involvement in reprogramming NFs into CAFs. Here we show that miR-9, upregulated in various breast cancer cell lines and identified as pro-metastatic miRNA, affects the properties of human breast fibroblasts, enhancing the switch to CAF phenotype, thus contributing to tumor growth. Expressed at higher levels in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients, miR-9 improves indeed migration and invasion capabilities when transfected in immortalized NFs; viceversa, these properties are strongly impaired in CAFs upon miR-9 inhibition. We also demonstrate that tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake results in enhanced cell motility. Moreover, we observed that this miRNA is also secreted by fibroblasts and in turn able to alter tumor cell behavior, by modulating its direct target E-cadherin, and NFs themselves. Consistently with the biological effects observed, gene expression profiles of NFs upon transient transfection with miR-9 show the modulation of genes mainly involved in cell motility and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. Finally, we were able to confirm the capability of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 to promote in vivo tumor growth. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively.

Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

(A2\u2013E2) Histograms demonstrating the distribution of expression levels of each of the factors in basal and luminal-A patient tumors. RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2). (B) CCL2 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (B1) and IL-1\u03b2 (B2). (C) CCL5 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (C1) and IL-1\u03b2 (C2). RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Pro-metastatic Chemokines Reach Their Highest Expression Levels When TNBC:Stroma \u201cContact\u201d Co-cultures Are Stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2To follow up on the above findings, we asked how the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 regulate TNBC:MSC interactions that may lead to elevated release of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. \u2227In panel 5B1, this value was significant in 2 out of 3 experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.To follow up on the data of Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their targets - CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 - were significantly lower in luminal-A patients than in basal patients, we determined how these three chemokines are affected by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of luminal-A:MSC co-cultures. Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with T47D cells and MSCs.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells. Studies of endothelial cell (HPMEC) migration in response to CM derived from different cell combinations of MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) (A) and MCF-7 cells (B). (A1, B1) Representative photos of HPMEC migration in response to TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10 ng/ml), from tumor cells alone, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 alone and from tumor cells grown under \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs only. Bars, 50 \u03bcm.

Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

Migration assays were performed in response to medium containing 10% FBS, for 12 h. ***p < 0.001, ns=non-significant for differences between migration of tumor cells in different combinations, compared to the migration of non-stimulated TNBC cells. \u2227In panel (A2), this value was significant in 1 out of 3 experiments.

In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL. Parallel studies indicated that the efficiency of CXCL8 down-regulation was high [80\u201390% in most experiments, as in; Data not shown]. The cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml); then, the cells or their CM were assayed in the following tests: (A) Endothelial cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 8A). ***p < 0.001; (B) Tumor cell morphology (Procedures as in Figure 9A1).

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

Clinically, BC has different histological forms, which may lead to different treatment regimens and prognosis. Although early diagnosis and treatment strategies, such as endocrine agents, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and biological targeting agents, have been improved in recent decades, the prognosis of BC remains poor, especially of patients with recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, establishing molecular biomarkers that can detect early metastasis of BC is necessary for BC patients.It has been shown that the interaction between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The interactions between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment are mediated through direct or indirect mechanisms, which involve in deposited substances, stromal cells, or secretion of proteins. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to be the most enriched cells in tumor stroma and promote tumor growth and metastasis by secreting a variety of soluble factors, directly interacting with tumor cells, regulating immune-response, and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Studies comparing co-culture of BC cells with or without fibroblasts showed increased proliferation, anti-apoptosis, metastasis, metabolism, and chemoresistance when they were co-cultured. Interestingly, not only CAFs within tumor but also CAFs immediately adjacent to tumor promoted cancer progression.Chemokines are a family of cytokines or signaling proteins exerting their biological effects by interacting with G-protein-coupled receptors, initiating an intracellular signal cascade that facilitates migration to chemokine source. There are increasing evidences that chemokines and chemokine receptors directly affect the survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis of many cancer cells, including BC cells, which express chemokine receptors and respond to specific chemokines. C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is an important chemokine receptor for BC progression that is expressed in BC and correlated with a poor survival outcome of BC patients. The ability of CAFs to influence tumor growth was partly dependent on their ability to induce angiogenesis by CAF derived C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), a ligand of CCR4. C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) is another ligand of CCR4 that is highly expressed by thymus and other cells such as fibroblasts, and CCL17/CCR4 signaling promotes lung metastasis of BC. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the CCL17/CCR4 signaling mediated by CAFs in BC progression remain elusive.The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, including the well-known mediator extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), regulates matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) expression. MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a role in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and immune-response and affect bioactive molecules on the cell surface, suggesting that they play important roles inside and outside of ECM degradation. MMP13 is known to promote BC cell invasion and metastasis and is associated with overall survival of BC patients. ERK1/2, as well as its downstream signaling effector MMP13, is some of the mechanism by which CXCL12/CXCR4 or CCL17/CCR4 regulates cell invasion and migration of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. However, how CCL17 regulates ERK1/2 pathway directly or indirectly remains unclear. MAP kinase phosphatase enzymes (MKPs) belong to the family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), inactivating different MAPK proteins, including ERK1/2. Among these, DUSP6 displays a high specificity for ERK1/2 and has been found to regulate BC cell migration and invasion.Hence, the correlation of clinicopathological characteristics with CCL17 expression, the functional effect of CAFs on BC progression, and the potential mechanisms by which CCL17 promotes tumor were clarified. In the present study, we found that CCL17 expression is increased in BC tissues and CAFs and associates with lymph nodes, TNM stage, and tumor size of BC patients. CCL17 produced by CAFs promotes migration and invasion of BC cells through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Therefore, our findings emphasize an important role for CCL17 in controlling BC development, which is helpful to identify potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.Materials and methodsTissue samples and isolation of primary fibroblastsHuman BC tissues and the corresponding adjacent-normal breast tissues as well as peripheral blood samples were obtained from 140 BC patients who underwent surgery at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between 2016 and 2018. These adjacent-normal breast tissues were resected within at least 5 cm of the tumor margin when the patients underwent definitive surgery. The healthy control groups included 140 healthy women who underwent mammary gland examination prior to peripheral blood sample collection. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described previously. Briefly, tumor and adjacent-normal tissues were digested with 2% collagenase II (1 mg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 mins at 37\u00b0C, then cultured in DMEM containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37\u00b0C in an incubator, and the fibroblasts derived from tumor and adjacent-normal tissues were defined as CAFs and NFs, respectively. The medium was changed every 2 days. In the present study, low-passage-number primary fibroblasts (<4) were used and characterized by strong immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and negative immunohistochemical staining for CK19 (Figure S1), using anti-CK19 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; ab52625) or anti-vimentin antibody (Abcam; ab8978).Ethical approvalAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Written informed consents were provided prior to enrollment of patients.Cell cultureHuman BC cell lines MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation, Rochester, MI, USA) and MDA-MB-231 (EG&G Mason Research Institute, Worcester, MA, USA) were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified air atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Solarbio).Transfection and lentivirus infectionThe RNAi (RNA interference) sequences targeting position 227\u2013245 (shRNA-1; 5\u02b9-GCTGCCTGGAGTACTTCAA-3\u02b9), position 366\u2013384 (shRNA-2; 5\u02b9-GCTGCCTGGAGTACTTCAA-3\u02b9) or position 379\u2013397 (shRNA-3; 5\u02b9-GCAGTTAAATACCTGCAAA-3\u02b9) of the human CCL17 gene were cloned into the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA). For lentiviral production, HEK-293T cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of the lentiviral vectors for 4 hrs. After incubation for 48 hrs, viral particles in cell culture medium were collected and infected CAFs. CCL17 or DUSP6 overexpression was constructed by cloning full-length human CCL17 or DUSP6 into the pLVX-Puro lentiviral expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and then transfected into 293T cells as above described and used to infect NFs or MCF-7 cells. Cells transduced with pLKO.1-scramble shRNA (shNC) or blank pLVX-Puro (Vector) were used as negative controls.Cafs/nfs and MCF-7/MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultureCAFs with pLKO.1-CCL17-shRNA or shNC infection and NFs with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank vector infection were digested with trypsin and resuspended in DMEM with the cell density of 5\u00d7104/mL. 0.1 mL cell suspension (5\u00d7103 cells per well) in each group was added into the upper well of the transwell inserts containing polycarbonate filters with 3-\u03bcm pores (Corning, Madrid, Spain). The lower chamber was inoculated with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells at a density of 5\u00d7103 cells per well and cultured in the incubator of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. After co-culture for 48 hrs, the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were collected for the following experiments.Cell proliferationCells (3\u00d7103/well) were seeded into 96-well plate and maintained overnight prior to conduction of experiments. After 12, 24, and 48 hrs, cells were incubated with 10% Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) solution (SAB Biotech., College Park, MD, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Optical density at wavelength 450 nm (OD450) was determined using a microplate reader.Transwell assayCells (3\u00d7105/well) were seeded onto 24-well plates and maintained overnight prior to conduction of experiments. After treatment, cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs, following which 3\u00d7105 cells/well in 300 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM were placed in the upper chamber at 37\u00b0C. The DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (700 \u03bcL) was added into the lower chamber. After 24 hrs incubation, the cell invasion and migration were determined in Transwell inserts (Millipore) containing polycarbonate filters with 8 \u03bcm pores coated with or without Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) as detailed previously.RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from BC cell lines or tissues using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and reverse transcription reaction on RNA was carried out using PrimeScript reagent kit (Takara Biomedical Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Real-time Quantitative PCR for CCL17, CCR4, and DUSP6 was performed using an ABI Prism 7,500 sequence detection PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Shanghai, China). The primer sequences were shown subsequently: CCL17 (Homo sapiens), 5\u02b9-GTCTTGAAGCCTCCTCAC-3\u02b9 (forward), 5\u02b9-CATGGCTCCAGTTCAGAC-3\u02b9 (reverse); CCR4 (Homo sapiens), 5\u02b9-CCTTCCTGGCTTTCTGTTC-3\u02b9 (forward), 5\u02b9-CATCTTCACCGCCTTGTTC-3\u02b9 (reverse); GAPDH (Homo sapiens), 5\u02b9-AATCCCATCACCATCTTC-3\u02b9 (forward), 5\u02b9-AGGCTGTTGTCATACTTC-3\u02b9 (reverse). Gene expression was determined by normalizing to GAPDH and calculating by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)CCL17 content in peripheral blood or fibroblast supernatants was measured by Human TARC ELISA Kit (CCL17) (Abcam; ab183366) and MMP13 content in BC cell supernatants was measured by MMP13 Human ELISA Kit (Abcam; ab100605), following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.Western blotWestern blotting was conducted as previously described. Proteins were analyzed with the following antibodies: anti-CCL17 (Abcam; ab182793; 1:300), anti-CCR4 (Abcam; ab83250; 1:1,000, anti-DUSP6 (Abcam; ab181088; 1:1,000), anti-MMP13 (Abcam; ab84594; 1:1,000), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 9102; 1:1000), anti-p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 9,101; 1:1,000), anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology; 5,174; 1:2,000) and the secondary antibodies (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China; A0208; 1:1000).Statistical analysesAll experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. The results represent the mean \u00b1 SD where applicable. The numerical data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). Differences between the groups were determined with one-way ANOVA analyses followed by Dunnett\u2019s test, two-way ANOVA analyses followed by Tukey post-test or Student\u2019s t-test when only two groups were compared. Correlations between CCL17 and DUSP6 expression levels in BC tissues were assessed by Pearson correlation.

CCL17 expression was increased in tumor BC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent-normal tissues as well as in peripheral blood from BC patients compared with healthy controls (Figure 1A and B). Moreover, CAFs in the microenvironment are essential for tumor progression in BC. To know the role of CCL17 in CAFs, CCL17 expression is also measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1C and D, CCL17 expression was also increased in CAFs compared with NFs.Correlation of CCL17 expression with clinicopathological features of BCClinicopathological parameter\tCCL17 expression\tP-value\t \tHigh (n=98)\tLow (n=42)\t \tAge (years)\u2003<57\u2003\u226557\t5543\t2814\t0.2445\t \tTumor size (cm)\u2003<3\u2003\u22653\t5147\t3012\t0.0333\t \tTNM stage\u2003I/II\u2003III/IV\t6137\t348\t0.0299\t \tLymph nodes\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t6236\t1329\t0.0004\t \tHistologic grade\u2003I\u2003II\u2003III\t293138\t111219\t0.7158\t \tHistological type\u2003Ductal\u2003Non-ductal\t5840\t1824\t0.0756\t \tER status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t4850\t2220\t0.7122\t \tPR status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t5543\t2913\t0.1526\t \tHER2 status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t5741\t2715\t0.4980\t \tNote: Differences between groups were done by the Chi-square test.Abbreviations: BC, breast cancer; ER, estrogen receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor type 2. To further analyze the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and CCL17 expression, the 140 BC patients were divided into two groups according to the mRNA level of CCL17 measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR comprising a CCL17 high expression group with fold change >1.5 (n=98, 70%) and CCL17 low expression group with fold change <1.5 (n=42, 30%) (Table 1). The age, histologic grade, histological type, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status of the patients were not significantly associated with the expression of CCL17. A statistically significant association of CCL17 was observed with tumor size, TNM stage, and lymph nodes. These data suggest that high CCL17 expression is closely correlated with tumor progression in BC patients. CCL17 regulates CCR4 expression and the proliferation of fibroblastsCCL17 expression regulated the proliferation of fibroblasts. CAFs were transduced with pLKO.1-CCL17 shRNA or shNC, and NFs were transduced with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank pLVX-Puro (vector). (A, C) CCL17 content was measured by ELISA; (B, D) CCR4 expression was measured by Western blot; and (E, F) cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; NFs, normal fibroblasts; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To investigate the pivotal role of CCL17/CCR4 signaling in fibroblasts, CCL17 was knockdown and overexpression in CAFs and NFs, respectively, and CCL17 and CCR4 expression level in cell lysate and cell supernatant was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR, Western blot and ELISA analysis. As shown in Figure S2A and B, CCL17 shRNA-1, shRNA-2, and shRNA-3 significantly decreased the mRNA levels of CCL17 by 74.6%, 81.6%, and 65.6% and the protein levels of CCL17 by 75.3%, 70.7%, and 66.4% in CAFs compared with shNC, respectively. CCL17 overexpression significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of CCL17 by 4.3-fold and 3.9-fold in NFs compared with blank vector, respectively (Figure S2C and D). Meanwhile, CCL17 shRNA-1 and shRNA-2 also significantly decreased the CCL17 release and CCR4 expression in CAFs (Figure 2A and B), while CCL17 overexpression markedly increased the CCL17 release and CCR4 expression in NFs (Figure 2C and D). Moreover, our data showed that CCL17 knockdown markedly decreased the cell proliferation of CAFs by approximately 17% at 48 hrs, while CCL17 overexpression markedly increased the cell proliferation of NFs by 15.6% at 48 hrs (Figure 2E and F). These data suggest that CCL17/CCR4 signaling involves in the proliferation of fibroblasts.CCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibits BC cell invasion and migrationCCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs. (A, B) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8, and (C\u2013E) invasion and migration were measured by Transwell assay. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer. To explore the important role of CAFs in invasion and migration of BC cells, MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CAFs with CCL17 knockdown, and the CCK-8 and Transwell assay were performed. As shown in Figure 3A and B, CAFs could increase the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells by 19.8% and 21.7% at 48 hrs, which were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs. Moreover, CAFs also increased the migration and invasion of MCF-7 by 2.04-fold and 2.0-fold and that of MDA-MB-231 cells by 2.78-fold and 3.02-fold, which were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs (Figure 3C\u2013E).CCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibited CCL17, CCR4, MMP13, and p-ERK1/2 but promoted DUSP6 expression in BC cell lines. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, and the expression of (A, B) CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, (A, C) p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting. MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, and the expression of (E, F) CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, (E, G) p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs. (D, H) The MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. *P<0.05, \u00a0**P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer.To further determine the importance of CCL17/CCR4 signaling in BC cell invasion and migration, the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, DUSP6, and MMP13 was measured by Western blotting. We found that CAFs not only induced the expression of CCL17 and CCR4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but also increased the expression of MMP13 and p-ERK1/2 and decreased the DUSP6 expression. However, these CAFs-mediated protein expressions were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs (Figure 4A\u2013H). These data suggested that CAFs with CCL17 knockdown suppressed BC cell migration and invasion.CCL17 overexpression in NFs promotes BC cell invasion and migrationCCL17 overexpression in NFs promotes BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 overexpression-induced NFs. (A) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8; (B, C) migration and invasion were measured by Transwell; (D\u2013F) expression of CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting; and (G) MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: NFs, normal fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We further examined the effect of NFs with CCL17 overexpression on BC cell migration and invasion. We found that co-culture with NFs increased MCF-7 cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and the expression of CCL17, CCR4, MMP13, and p-ERK1/2 and decreased the DUSP6 expression, which was significantly enhanced by CCL17 overexpression in NFs (Figure 5A\u2013G).DUSP6 overexpression inhibited BC cell invasion and migrationDUSP6 overexpression inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. (A\u2013C) MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant CCL17 protein (rCCL17; 50, 100, and 200 ng/mL), and the expression of CCR4 and DUSP6 was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot. MCF-7 cells were transduced with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank pLVX-Puro (vector) in the presence or absence of recombinant CCL17 (100 ng/mL).

It was found that recombinant CCL17 protein significantly increased the CCR4 expression and decreased the DUSP6 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A\u2013C). These results suggest that DUSP6 may involve in CCL17-mediated BC progression. To confirm our hypothesis, MCF-7 cells with DUSP6 overexpression were treated with recombinant CCL17 protein (100 ng/mL), and the cell invasion, migration, and the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and MMP13 were measured. The results showed that DUSP6 overexpression inhibited recombinant CCL17 protein-induced cell migration, invasion, and the expression of MMP13 and p-ERK1/2 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 6D\u2013G). Previous study demonstrated that DUSP6 is a key ERK-specific phosphatase that induces dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, negatively regulating the ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, it suggests that ERK1/2 signaling may associate with CCL17-induced BC cell migration and invasion.Correlation analyses in BC tissuesCorrelation analysis between DUSP6 and CCL17 in BC tissues. (A) DUSP6 mRNA levels in BC tissues (n=140) and corresponding adjacent-normal tissues (n=140) were measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR. (B) Pearson correlation scatter plots in BC tissues (n=140). ***P<0.001.Abbreviation: BC, breast cancer. We next investigate DUSP6 expression by Real-time Quantitative PCR in tumor tissues from BC patients. DUSP6 expression was decreased in tumor tissues compared with their corresponding adjacent-normal controls (Figure 7A). Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP6 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the mRNA expression of CCL17 in BC tissues (Figure 7B). These data further supported the findings in BC cell lines.DiscussionThere are reports shown that development of cancer is not only dependent on tumor cells, but also co-mediated by the tumor microenvironment. CAFs, the most common stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, significantly contribute to tumor initiation, proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, and drug resistance in various types of cancers, including BC. It has been well established that chemokines and their receptors are participated in the cross-talk of fibroblasts and cancer cells. Here, we focused on the function of CAF-associated CCL17 in cell invasion and migration of BC via a clinical exploration and in vitro investigation. In this study, we showed that CCL17 levels were significantly up-regulated in BC tissues, peripheral blood, and CAFs compared with their corresponding controls, respectively. CCL17 expression was correlated with lymph nodes, TNM stage and tumor size of BC patients. CAFs or NFs-derived CCL17 may promote BC cell invasion and migration through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway.It is worth noting that the CCL17 plays an important role in promoting cancer progression. In fact, our clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that high CCL17 expression was correlated with advanced TNM stage, larger tumor size and increased lymph node metastasis, indicating that CCL17 is associated with the aggressiveness of BC. Consistent with our findings, CCL17 expression was found increased in BC tissues in comparison to normal tissues. CCL17 recruits CCR4 positive regulatory T cells and promotes lung metastasis of BC. Moreover, CCR4 positively correlates with lymph node metastasis in BC patients, supporting our result of higher expression of CCL17 in BC patients with positive lymph nodes. However, CCL17 mRNA expression was correlated with races and HER2 status, but age and stage were not found to be correlated with CCL17 expression in BC. Weide et al, reported that serum CCL17 level was lower in melanoma patients compared with healthy controls. Similar finding in our study was that of a statistically significant increase of CCL17 content in peripheral blood in BC patients compared with healthy controls, and CCL17 may therefore as differentiation maker between BC and healthy women.Many groups have identified that CAFs significantly contributed to cancer progression. For example, CAFs-derived interleukin 32 (IL32) promotes BC cell invasion and metastasis via integrin \u03b23-p38 MAPK signaling. CAFs promoted hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, and CXCL16 through hedgehog and TGF-\u03b2 pathways. CAFs promoted integrin \u03b21 clustering and invasiveness in gastric cancer through activating CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Our study showed that CAFs-induced BC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and CCR4 expression were significantly reversed by CCL17 down-regulation in CAFs, while the tumor-promoting effects of NFs on BC were markedly strengthened by CCL17 up-regulation in NFs. Since CCL17 activates ERK1/2 signaling and CCR4 acts as a downstream target of ERK1/2/NF-\u03baB pathway, we indicate that CCL17 positively regulates CCR4 protein levels through activating ERK1/2 signaling. CCL17/CCR4 signaling is of great importance in CAFs/NFs-induced BC metastasis. In line with our findings, CCL17 originating from CXCL14-activated fibroblasts that display phenotypes similar to CAFs can markedly increase migration and invasion abilities of BC cells and is potentially associated with EMT, which is markedly inhibited by CCR4 down-regulation. Moreover, CCR4 enhances the chemotactic response of BC cells to CCL17, promotes BC cell growth and metastasis in vivo, but has no effect on BC cell proliferation in vitro. It is acknowledged that normal fibroblasts are often considered to be tumor suppressive. Meanwhile, NFs also have no effect on regulating cancer cells in the co-culture system. Therefore, the role of NFs in tumorigenesis needs to be further investigated.Previous study also showed that CXCL14 secreted by BC cells activated mammary fibroblasts through the ERK1/2 pathway, and activated CAFs promoted the cell migration and metastasis of BC through the CCL17/CCR4 axis. In the present study, CAFs or NFs-induced ERK1/2 activation and its downstream signaling effector MMP13 in BC cells were inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs and strengthened by CCL17 overexpression in NFs, respectively. DUSP6 is an effective phosphatase that reverses ERK1/2 phosphorylation and is therefore a negative regulator of MAPK activity, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 via pivotal negative feedback regulation of the ERK1/2 in diverse cancers. Treatment of BC cells with recombinant CCL17 significantly increased CCR4 while decreased DUSP6 expression in a dose-dependent manner. DUSP6 overexpression markedly inhibited cell invasion, migration, MMP13 expression and the ERK1/2 activation in MCF-7 cells with recombinant CCL17. These findings suggest DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway may involve in BC invasion and migration induced by CAFs-derived CCL17. MMP13 is known to promote BC cell invasion and metastasis and be associated with overall survival of BC patients. Stimulation of regulatory T cells with CCL17/CCR4 can phosphorylate ERK1/2, and CCR4 up-regulates MMP13 expression through ERK1/2 in colorectal cancer. Similarly, Zhao et al, also reported that CCL17/CCR4 axis can induce the metastasis of bladder cancer cells by promoting ERK1/2 signaling and MMP13 expression. CXCL12/CXCR4 promoted laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through MMP-13-dependent invasion via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Since DUSP6 undergoes highly specific interaction with ERK1/2, which leads to the DUSP6 inactivation, we suggest that CCL17 may regulate the DUSP6 levels through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, contrary to a tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 in cancers, DUSP6 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated decreased cell migration and invasion. Therefore, DUSP6 may play its functions depending on the histological subtypes of the cells.ConclusionIn conclusion, our study elucidated that regulation of CCL17 expression in CAFs promoted cell invasion and migration of BC through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway. These findings suggest that CAFs-derived CCL17 could be potential therapeutic targets for BC metastasis, although the further mechanistic study is warranted.Supplementary materialsDisclosureThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.ReferencesMFG-E8 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patientsPlasma chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 concentrations as diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer patientsAndrogen receptor in triple negative breast cancer: a potential target for the targetless subtypeThe chemokine receptor CCR4 promotes tumor growth and lung metastasis in breast cancerBioinformatics analysis revealing prognostic significance of RRM2 gene in breast cancerKRT19 and CEACAM5 mRNA-marked circulated tumor cells indicate unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin beta3-p38 MAPK signallingPhenotypic and functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast within the tumor microenvironmentTGF-beta receptor type-2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts regulates breast cancer cell growth and survival and is a prognostic marker in pre-menopausal breast cancerDown-regulation of miR-29b in carcinoma associated fibroblasts promotes cell growth and metastasis of breast cancerCancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated in cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and in the peritumoural skinCXCL12/CXCR4 activation by cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes integrin beta1 clustering and invasiveness in gastric cancerThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerCCL17/TARC and CCR4 expression in Merkel cell carcinomaBreast cancer lung metastasis requires expression of chemokine receptor CCR4 and regulatory T cellsAJUBA promotes the migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells through upregulation of MMP10 and MMP13 expressionBiochemical and biological attributes of matrix metalloproteinasesZinc finger protein 143 expression is closely related to tumor malignancy via regulating cell motility in breast cancerCCL17-CCR4 axis promotes metastasis via ERK/MMP13 pathway in bladder cancerCXCL12/CXCR4 promotes laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through MMP-13-dependent invasion via the ERK1/2/AP-1 pathwayDUSP6/MKP3 is overexpressed in papillary and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and contributes to neoplastic properties of thyroid cancer cellsSilencing of DUSP6 gene by RNAi-mediation inhibits proliferation and growth in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells: an in vitro studyLncRNA expression signatures of twist-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in MCF10A cellsCullin3 promotes breast cancer cells metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting BRMS1 for degradationDeubiquitinase USP47/UBP64E regulates beta-catenin ubiquitination and degradation and plays a positive role in Wnt signalingDual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6): a review of its molecular characteristics and clinical relevance in cancerRecent advances in understanding tumor stroma-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancerCC chemokines are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are associated with disparity in overall survivalIncreased CCL17 serum levels are associated with improved survival in advanced melanomaCancer-associated fibroblasts promote hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through chemokine-activated hedgehog and TGF-beta pathwaysCorrection: CCR4 promotes metastasis via ERK/NF-kappaB/MMP13 pathway and acts downstream of TNF-alpha in colorectal cancerHIC1 deletion promotes breast cancer progression by activating tumor cell/fibroblast crosstalkBiological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their paired normal fibroblasts in human breast cancerTumor suppressor dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) impairs cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated phenotypeDual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) is an ETS-regulated negative feedback mediator of oncogenic ERK signaling in lung cancer cellsSelective deregulation in chemokine signaling pathways of CD4+CD25(hi)CD127(lo)/(-) regulatory T cells in human allergic asthmaThe nuclear factor NF-kappaB pathway in inflammationDUSP6/MKP-3 inactivates ERK1/2 but fails to bind and inactivate ERK5"

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+.

Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant cell type within cancer stroma, play significant roles in overall breast cancer development and spread. Genetic and epigenetic changes activate stromal fibroblasts, which then escort cancer cells throughout the whole carcinogenic process in a paracrine manner. Indeed, activated fibroblasts secrete high levels of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which are used to communicate with cancer cells as well as with other stromal cells. CAFs exhibit some important features of neoplastic cells and have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models. High numbers of active stromal fibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs were shown to play major roles in drug resistance and tumour recurrence.Surgery is considered the first line of treatment for most breast tumours. During lumpectomy, the tumour is removed with some normal surrounding tissues (surgical margins) to ensure the removal of all tumour cells and to minimize local recurrence. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that surgical margin status influences the risk of local recurrence. Recurrences arise most frequently in the tumour bed. Thereby, radiotherapy is usually applied as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Furthermore, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) was also used and yielded very low recurrence rates when given as a boost. Importantly, TARGIT impaired the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding. This may be due to the immediate effect of radiation on the local tumour microenvironment, making it less favourable for tumour growth and progression. This suggests that cancer may recur following breast conserving surgery due to residual unresected tumour or to the presence of active stromal cells, or both. In fact, even in tumour-free tissues, the microenvironment could still play a capital role in tumour development/recurrence. Indeed, it has been recently shown that breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography, which is related to the surrounding stroma rather than to the cancer itself, had poorer prognostic features. Therefore, we sought to undergo molecular and cellular characterization of breast stromal fibroblasts from negative surgical margins. We show that these cells exhibit a specific gene expression profile and are procarcinogenic.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblasts were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients under Research Ethical Committee Project No. RAC#2031091. CAFs were derived from tumour areas of the samples, while TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of tissues was performed after routine examination by a certified anatomical pathologist, using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and epithelial cells (NLECs) were derived from healthy age-matched females who underwent breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments, NBFs, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, under the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). NLEC cells were cultured in universal medium [1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10\u20138 m choleratoxin, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 2 \u00d7 10\u20139 m T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 5 mg/ml oestrogen, and were used at passage 2. MCF-7 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), except for antibiotic/antimycotics and ITS, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells cultured in medium with serum, whilst serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was obtained from cells cultured in the absence of serum. In both cases, the cells were cultured for 24 h before the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Affymetrix exon array and data analysis; quantitative RT\u2013PCRExon array protocols are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was conducted as described previously. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the data analysed using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The respective primers are presented in Supplementary materials and methods.Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48 h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) after incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified at 450 nm.Immunoblotting, cytokine array and ELISAImmunoblotting of total cell protein lysates was performed as previously described. Antibodies are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. SFCMs from CAF, TCF and NBF cells were applied to a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody array (RayBiotech Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems; or RayBiotech for MMP-2). These experiments were performed in triplicate.Chemotaxis and invasion assayInvasion chambers (24-well) were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines (BD Bioscience); 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells, separated by an 8 \u00b5m pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane, using Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using a light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification \u00d740). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Orthotopic tumour xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH & RC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Fifteen female nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper, using the formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSurgical margin stromal fibroblasts exhibit a specific gene expression profileTo identify the molecular changes that can take place in breast stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins, gene expression profiles of five paired CAFs/TCFs as well as three NBFs were examined. Total RNA was extracted and genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed, using Affymetrix's GeneChip\u00ae Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (HE 1.0 STAs). Three different comparisons were performed: TCFs with CAFs; TCFs with NBFs; and CAFs with NBFs. p < 0.05 and a threshold of absolute fold change \u2264 2 \u2265 was considered a significant difference in the analysis of the microarray data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 804 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCF, CAF and NBF cells. The unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering revealed a clear pattern of gene expression, defining three main transcriptome clusters corresponding to TCFs, CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A).Differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Total RNA from five CAFs, their corresponding TCFs as well as three NBFs was used to perform genome-wide gene expression analysis. (A) Unsupervised 2D hierarchical clustering of significantly varying genes across the three groups was performed using Pearson's correlation with average linkage clustering (only the top 112 of the most significantly dysregulated genes are shown for readability). (B) The three dominant PCA components that contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix clearly distinguished samples as CAF, TCF and NBF. (C) Venn diagram showing differential gene expression between the groups. (D) qRT\u2013PCR data for the indicated genes (mean \u00b1 SD)Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA), which contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix, further showed the presence of three distinct groups (Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the TCF samples clustered closer to CAF cells than to NBFs. Moreover, the gene expression variability was highest for the TCF group (Figure 1B). Next, Venn diagram analysis was performed, with the significance of overlaps calculated using hypergeometric distributional assumption and p values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This comparison approach revealed a significant overlap between TCFs and CAFs as compared to the two other comparisons (p < 10\u20135) (Figure 1C). Indeed, among the three comparisons, the least number of DEGs was between CAFs versus TCFs, with only 42 DEGs (Figure 1C). On the other hand, the number of DEGs between CAFs and NBFs reached 101 (Figure 1C). Comparing TCF with NBF, we found 77 DEGs, 25 of which were also differentially expressed between CAFs and NBFs, while the levels of 49 genes were uniquely dysregulated in TCFs as compared to NBFs and CAFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that TCF cells present in surgical margins exhibit specific gene expression patterns relative to their corresponding CAFs and also normal breast fibroblasts.Quantitative RT\u2013PCR validation of gene expression resultsTo validate the RNA microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT\u2013PCR on nine genes: MMP-3, ITGB8, SFRP4, ITGBP7, ADAMTS1, CTGF, PTGS, SDHC and CCL-2. Figure 1D shows differential expression of all these genes between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. These results confirm the presence of differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokinesNext, we assessed the level of secreted pro-carcinogenic cytokines from CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Therefore, CAF-114, TCF-114 and NBF-6 were cultured to 80% confluency and then complete medium (CpM) was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM). Serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied to the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody array map. The array showed differential levels of various cytokines between TCF, CAF and NBF cells (Figure 2A). Upon quantification and normalization against the positive controls probed on the membrane, it was clear that CAFs secreted the highest levels of the majority of these cytokines (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the levels of SDF-1, CCL-25, TIMP-1 and TNF-alfa were also higher in TCF-114 cells than in NBF cells (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when comparing CAF-180, TCF-180 and NBF-1 (data not shown). This shows that TCFs, although present in histologically normal parts of the breast, secrete high levels of various pro-carcinogenic cytokines.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokines. SFCMs from the indicated cells were collected and applied on the human cytokine antibody array map. (A) Cytokine array maps highlighting the differentially expressed cytokines. (B) Quantification of the array data for selected cytokines. (C) SFCMs were used to assess the levels of the indicated proteins by ELISA in CAF/TCF pairs from three patients compared to NBF-6 (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005)TCFs secrete high levels of SDF-1, VEGF-A and IL-6To further show the variation in cytokine secretion, SFCMs were collected from three different CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (87, 180 and 142) and NBF-6, and were used to assess the levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A by ELISA. Figure 2C shows that CAF cells secreted the highest levels of the three cytokines. Interestingly, the secreted levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A were also higher in all TCFs compared to NBF-6 (8.2-, 4.2- and 25-fold higher, respectively) (Figure 2C). Figure 2C also shows inter-patient variation in the secreted levels of these important pro-carcinogenic factors. These results confirm that TCF cells secrete higher levels of pro-carcinogenic factors relative to normal breast fibroblasts.TCF cells from surgical margins exhibit features of active fibroblastsTo test whether fibroblasts from surgical margins display features of activation, we examined the levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 (two major markers of active breast fibroblasts) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, like CAF cells, TCFs also express higher levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 than NBF-6 and NBF-1 (Figure 3A). However, while the level of \u03b1-SMA was similar in TCFs and their corresponding CAFs, SDF-1 levels were slightly higher in CAF cells as compared to their respective TCFs (Figure 3A). Next, we studied the migratory and invasiveness abilities of TCF cells, using chambers either coated with Matrigel (invasion) or uncoated (migration). While CpM was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells (4 \u00d7 105) were added to the upper wells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Figure 3B shows that while NBF-1 and NBF-6 cells were unable to migrate, TCF-87 and TCF-180 cells showed invasiveness and migratory abilities. However, the number of invading and migrating TCF cells was lower than that of their corresponding CAF cells (Figure 3B). This provides further evidence that TCF cells display active fibroblast features.TCFs are active fibroblasts. (A) Immunoblotting for \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 of the indicated cell lysates. (B) Invasion/migration assays. The numbers of invaded/migrated cells are presented in the histogram (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005 for TCFs compared to NBF-1 and NBF-6; note that CAFs are also significantly different)Surgical margin fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous epithelial cellsTo further show the active state of TCF cells, we studied their paracrine effect on the proliferation of epithelial cells. SFCMs collected from CAF/TCF-142, -180, -87 and \u2212114 pairs and from NBF-6 and NBF-1 were used for culturing non-cancerous MCF10A epithelial cells. Proliferation of MCF10A cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF and TCF cells, compared to NBF cells. TCFs showed an intermediate effect between CAFs and NBFs (Figure 4). Indeed, after 24 h of incubation, SFCMs from TCF-87 and CAF-87 enhanced cell proliferation two- and four-fold, respectively, compared to SFCM from NBF cells (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained with CAF/TCF-180 and \u2212142 pairs (Figure 4). For CAF/TCF-114, both enhanced the proliferation of MCF10A by four-fold at 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs also enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.TCF-conditioned medium enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MCF10A cells were cultured in SFCMs from the indicated fibroblasts from four patients and proliferation measured at the indicated times using the WST-1 assay, compared to SFCMs from the two NBF cultures performed at the same time. Error bars represent \u00b1 SDTCFs promote migration/invasion and induce mesenchymal features of breast cancer cellsWe next investigated the effect of TCF cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. SFCMs collected from TCF-180, CAF-180 and NBF-6 were added to MCF-7 cells (105) that had previously been seeded in the upper compartments of migration/invasion plates. Figure 5A shows that the number of migrated MCF-7 cells was much higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF-180 and TCF-180 than with NBF-6 cells or SFM (used as negative control). Figure 5A shows that SFCMs from both CAF-180 and TCF-180 enhanced about 73-fold the migration ability of these breast cancer cells as compared to NBF-6.TCF cells enhance the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and promote EMT. (A) SCFMs from the indicated cells were added into the lower compartments of 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MCF-7 cells (105) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24 h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells are presented (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005). (B, C) MCF-7 or normal luminal epithelial cells (NLEC) were treated with the indicated SFCMs for 24 h and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodiesNext, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism/pathway that underlies TCF-dependent increase in the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored the paracrine effect of TCF cells on the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, a known pro-invasive protein kinase. Epithelial MCF-7 cells were treated with SFM or SFCM from TCF-180 and CAF-180 for 24 h. Figure 5B shows that SFCMs from TCF and CAF cells increased the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt, with no effect on the level of total protein. Since active Akt and the increase in the invasiveness/migratory abilities of breast cancer cells accompany the transition of these epithelial cells to the mesenchymal phenotype, we assessed the level of N-cadherin and Snail and showed that SFCM from TCF cells increased the level of these two important markers of mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B). On the other hand, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were markedly reduced (Figure 5B). These results indicate that, like CAFs, TCF cells have the ability to trigger the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.TCF cells activate Akt and up-regulate PCNA and MMP-2 in normal luminal cells in a paracrine mannerSince TCFs are present in histologically normal parts of the breast, we sought to investigate their effect on primary normal luminal epithelial cells (NLECs). Therefore, NLECs were incubated for 24 h with SFCMs from TCF, CAF and NBF, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Figure 5C shows increase in the level of the proliferation marker PCNA in luminal cells pretreated with SFCMs from CAF and TCF cells, with a higher effect of CAF cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt and also MMP-2 increased under the paracrine effect of TCF and CAF cells (Figure 5C). This shows that, like CAF cells, TCFs have the ability to promote tumourigenesis in normal luminal epithelial cells.TCFs stimulate breast cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse modelTo investigate the effect of fibroblasts on tumour growth in vivo, 15 nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer tumours were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. All mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF-180 cells developed tumours. On the other hand, while two of five mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and TCF-180 cells had tumours, only one mouse co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and NBF-6 cells developed a tumour (Figure 6A). Importantly, this tumour appeared 29 days post-injection, while tumours containing TCF and CAF cells appeared only 15 days after implantation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, at 40 days post-injection, while the size of the tumour containing NBF-6 cells reached a volume of 1.4 cm3, the tumours containing TCF and CAF cells reached 4 cm3 and 7 cm3 on average, respectively (Figure 6A, B). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs have the ability to promote tumour formation and growth compared to normal fibroblasts.TCFs enhance the formation and the growth of human breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice. Breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells under the nipples of nude mice. (A) Tumour size 40 days post-injection. (B) Time-dependent tumour growth (mean \u00b1 SD)DiscussionWe have shown here that breast stromal fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins exhibit a specific gene expression pattern compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal breast fibroblasts, with 77 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and NBFs and 42 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and their paired CAFs. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of 49 genes was specific for TCF cells, as compared to CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues around tumours may also be affected by the presence of tumour cells. Notably, the genes that were found differentially expressed uniquely in TCFs were enriched with biological processes and functions related to, among others, inflammatory response, response to stimulus, immune cell trafficking, tissue development and cell signalling (see Supplementary material, Figure S1A, Table S2). To elucidate how these deregulated genes are interacting with genes in various metabolic pathways, the DEGs were mapped to gene networks using the ingenuity knowledge base. The network analysis revealed the potentially important role of CCL13, CTGF, CYP1B1, IGFBP7 and B4GALT1 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1B). Interestingly, genes deregulated in TCF cells interact, directly or indirectly, with the UBC gene (see Supplementary material, Figure S1C), which plays an essential role in maintaining ubiquitin levels, especially under stress conditions. Indeed, this polyubiquitin gene is up-regulated by cellular stresses and contains classical heat-shock elements in its promoter, suggesting that stress-related factors are involved in the TCF-specific gene expression profile and may relate to evidence that cancer cells use oxidative stress to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Comparing the variation in gene expression in each cell type showed variability within the three categories of cells. Interestingly, the gene expression profiles of TCF cells were more heterogeneous than those of CAF and NBF cells (Figure 1C), indicating higher patient-to-patient variability in stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues.Differential gene expression between CAF and TCF cells from breast tumours has been reported previously. Bauer et al found 37 genes differentially expressed between six paired TCFs and CAFs and have also shown higher gene expression variability in TCF than in CAF cells. In another study, 420 genes were found to be differentially expressed between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties (NBFs). Similarly, we have shown here that the expression of 101 genes varied between CAF and NBF cells. However, the current study presents the first micro-array comparative analysis between surgical margin fibroblasts, their corresponding CAFs and NBFs. In addition, we have shown that fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins have higher migratory/invasiveness abilities than normal breast fibroblasts. Furthermore, these cells enhanced the proliferation rate of non-carcinogenic epithelial cells and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as the formation/growth of breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, like CAFs, TCFs induced features of mesenchymal cells in breast cancer cells. Moreover, TCFs up-regulated PCNA and MMP2 and activated Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. This indicates that these cells have the ability to promote cancer development and progression. This effect could be mediated through secretion of cytokines and/or energy transfer mechanisms (reverse Warburg effect).Notably, the magnitude of all these TCF-related effects was intermediate between those of CAFs and NBFs. This shows that, despite their localization in histologically normal breast tissues and not being in direct contact with cancer cells, TCFs acquired some myofibroblast features, suggesting that cancer cells can affect not only cancer-associated fibroblasts but also fibroblasts present in cancer-free adjacent tissues. This effect could be mediated through secreted molecules able to diffuse from cancer cells through normal tissue, reaching distant cells. TGF\u03b2 could play an important role in this effect. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 can induce the production of \u03b1-SMA in mammary fibroblasts in vitro and consequently transdifferentiates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It is also possible that cancer cells activate adjacent fibroblasts through the aerobic glycolysis process (Warburg effect), which produces pyruvate and lactate. Indeed, treatment with lactate transport inhibitor prevented the conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.Our data indicate that remaining active fibroblasts following resection may enhance the chances of tumour recurrence, since these cells may constitute a fertile soil for tumour growth. To date, the most appropriate amount of normal breast tissue that should be removed to minimize local recurrence remains controversial. However, it is well known that local recurrence in patients submitted to conservative surgery is more common than in patients treated by mastectomy, showing the importance of surgical margins status for local relapse. Furthermore, several publications have reported the importance of the pathological margin status in determining the risk of local recurrence after breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, the present data show that breast stromal fibroblasts localized in cancer-free surgical margins are active and hence can potentiate the carcinogenesis process, and indicate that the tumour microenvironment may play determinant roles in local recurrence. Therefore, in the era of personalized therapy, the status of tumour stroma should also be taken into consideration for more efficient treatment and the prevention of recurrence as well as metastasis.Author contributionsMAA, S-FH and AAl performed experiments and analysed the data; FA performed experiments on the mice; DC and NK performed the micro-array data analysis; OA provided the tissues; AA supervised the work and analysed the data; and DC and AA wrote the paper.

        "title": "Effects of cytokines derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts on androgen synthetic enzymes in estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma.",
        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

        "content": "Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), the most aggressive form of the disease, is a serious threat for women's health worldwide. The AU-rich RNA-binding factor 1 (AUF1) promotes the formation of chemo-resistant breast cancer stem cells. Thereby, we investigated the power of AUF1 expression, in both cancer cells and their stromal fibroblasts, as predictive biomarker for LABC patients' clinical outcome following neoadjuvant treatment. We have used immunohistochemistry to assess the level of AUF1 on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Immunoblotting was utilized to show the effect of AUF1 ectopic expression in breast stromal fibroblasts on the expression of various genes both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the WST1 assay, while a label-free real-time setting using the xCELLigence RTCA technology was utilized to assess the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of cells. We have shown that high AUF1 immunostaining (\u2265\u200910%) in both cancer cells and their adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was significantly associated with higher tumor grade. Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between high AUF1 level in CAFs and poor patient's survival. This correlation was highly significant in patients with triple negative breast cancer, who showed poor disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). High expression of AUF1 in CAFs was also associated with poor OS of ER+/Her2- patients. Similarly, AUF1-positive malignant cells tended to be associated with shorter DFS and OS of ER+/Her2+ patients. Interestingly, neoadjuvant therapy downregulated AUF1 to a level lower than 10% in malignant cells in a significant number of patients, which improved both DFS and OS. In addition, ectopic expression of AUF1 in breast fibroblasts activated these cells and enhanced their capacity to promote, in an IL-6-dependent manner, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness processes. Furthermore, these AUF1-expressing cells enhanced the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells and their growth in orthotopic tumor xenografts.

BC is typically an extremely heterogeneous disease with high inter- and intra-tumor variabilities, which complicates diagnostics/prognostics as well as personalized therapy. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) continues to be a serious health problem with adverse outcome despite all the revolutionary advancements made in cancer therapy and the introduction of precision medicine. However, the prognostic of this aggressive form of BC has been improved through the introduction of some biological characteristics, which allow to choose the most suitable systemic treatments.In addition to the heterogeneous composition of breast cancer, tumor cells are part of a very complex and dynamic ecosystem composed of various types of cells, hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix and other factors. Several lines of evidence indicate the presence of various cooperative signaling loops between cancer cells and their adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which influence the evolution and therapeutic response of cancer. Thereby, it has become clear that CAFs and their biomarkers could be of great predictive/prognostic value. In this direction, we have recently shown that the RNA-binding protein AUF1 (also called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D, hnRNPD) plays a major role in the activation and the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts. In addition, AUF1 can promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as well as stemness in mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, we sought to investigate here the potential use of the AUF1 expression level in breast cancer cells and their adjacent CAFs as prognostic tool for patients suffering LABC. The present findings present clear evidence that AUF1 expression level in breast CAFs has prognostic values for breast cancer patients, especially those diagnosed as TNBC. Furthermore, neoadjuvant therapy-dependent downregulation of AUF1 to a low level in tumor cells was shown to be associated with better survival. Additionally, we have shown that BSFs that express high level of AUF1 promote carcinogenesis and chemoresistance in a paracrine manner.MethodsCells and cell cultureBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and used as previously described. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased in 2011 from ATCC and were authenticated using short tandem repeat profiling by ATCC, propagated, expanded and frozen immediately into numerous aliquots after arrival. The revived cells were utilized within 10 to 12 passages and not exceeding a period of 3\u00a0months and were cultured following the instructions of the company. Cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kits (Lonza). All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotic and antimycotic solutions, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. The anti-AUF1 antibody (07-260) was purchased from Millipore. Antibodies directed against Twist1 (10E4E6), IL-6, Snail (C15D3) were purchased from Abcam. ALDH1/2 (H-85), CD24 (C-20) and GAPDH (FL-335) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (USA). E-cadherin (24E10), N-cadherin, OCT4 (C30A3), Sox2 (D6D9), STAT3 (124H6), p-STAT3 (Tyr705), KLF-4 (D1F2), cleaved PARP (Asp214), cleaved caspase-9 (Asp315), cyclinD1 (DCS6) and EpCAM (D1B3) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (USA). CD44 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-ZEB1 was purchased from Abnova and anti-vimentin from Abcam. ALDH1 was purchased from BD biosciences. All of these antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody (6708-11) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assaysThese assays were performed in a label-free real-time setting using the xCELLigence RTCA technology (Roche, Germany) that measures impedance changes in a meshwork of interdigitated gold microelectrodes located at the well bottom (E-plate) or at the bottom side of a microporous membrane (CIM-plate 16). Cell migration and invasion were assessed as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM-plate coated with a thin layer of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) basement membrane diluted 1:20 in serum-free medium (invasion) or non-coated (migration). Complete medium was used as a chemo-attractant in the lower chambers. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24\u00a0h and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as Cell Index (CI) value, which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate.For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were seeded in E-plate with complete medium as per the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Cell proliferation was assessed for 48\u00a0h. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell Index was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by background value, which represents cell status. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate.Spheroid formationCells were seeded in 96-well ultra-low attachment plate at density of 1000 viable cells/well. Cells were cultured in 171 medium supplemented with 1% ABM, 2% B-27, 20\u00a0ng/ml EGF, 500\u00a0ng/ml HC, 4% FBS and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin. Cells were incubated for 10\u00a0days at 37\u00a0\u00b0C under 5% CO2. Mammospheres with diameter of\u2009\u2265\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcm were counted using OPTIKA light microscope. Experiments were performed three times in triplicate.Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24\u00a0h, and then, media were collected and briefly centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C until needed.Immunoadsorption of cytokine/antibody complex from SFCMIL-6 present in the serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) from TCF64-ORF cells was first inhibited by an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. IgG (R&D systems) was used as control. To deplete TCF64-ORF-SFCM from IL-6nAb as well as IL-6/IL-6nAb complex, A/G Sepharose (8\u00a0mg/ml) (BioVision) was added to SFCM and incubated overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and filtered.Patients and archived clinical materialsFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained from the Pathology Department at KFSH&RC with institutional review board approval (RAC#2151051). The study cohort consisted of 344 patients (females) who were histologically diagnosed with unilateral locally advanced breast cancer (T2\u2009\u2265\u20094\u00a0cm, T3 or T4, N0\u2013N2, M0) of non-inflammatory nature. These patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus Trastuzumab when HER2 positive and definitive surgery and locoregional radiotherapy\u2009\u00b1\u2009hormonal therapy, as previously described. The enrolled patients were diagnosed between 2006 and 2013, with a median follow-up time of 52. 6\u00a0months. Written informed consent was not required, and a waiver was granted since samples were anonymized to the research team. Diagnosis of invasive breast cancer was done through true-cut needle biopsy. Immunohistochemistry of pre-treatment biopsy was used to determine estrogen (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) and HER2.Immunohistochemistry staining on FFPE tissuesImmunohistochemistry for AUF1 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using anti-AUF1 antibody from Abcam (ab50692) overnight at a dilution of 1:500, and slides were stained using automated staining platform (Ventana). Envision\u2009+\u2009polymer (ready to use; Dako) was used as a secondary antibody. Color was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and instant hematoxylin (Shandon) was used for counterstaining. The AUF1 level was evaluated and verified by two qualified pathologists, who scored both the proportion of positive cells and the intensity of AUF1 expression in both cancer cells and their stromal fibroblasts, and an immunoreactivity score was determined and used for statistical analysis.Flow cytometryCells (2.105) were treated and then stained with CD44/CD24 as previously described. Briefly, cells were washed and incubated with CD44 Pacific-Blue (from Invitrogen, USA) and CD24 PE (from BD Biosciences, USA) antibodies for surface staining (30\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). Data were acquired using the LSR II flow cytometer and the BD FACSDiva operating software. Positive staining was considered based on the negativity of an isotype control. A minimum of 10,000 events was recorded for all samples.Cytotoxicity assay5000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates with appropriate culture media. After cells treatment, WST1 reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's instructions. These experiments were performed in triplicates and were repeated several times.Orthotopic tumor xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH&RC institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Ten female nude mice were randomized into 2 groups, and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) with TCF64-ORF or TCF64-CTRL cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumor size was measured with a caliper using the following formula (Length X Width X Height).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by the software package SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Continuous variables were compared by Student\u2019s t test, and P values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant. Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used in survival tables and curves, and the different subgroups were compared by the log-rank test.ResultsCorrelation of AUF1 expression in cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts with clinicopathological parametersIn the present study, we investigated the value of AUF1 expression level in both cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts as predictive biomarker for clinical outcome of LABC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy\u2009\u00b1\u2009Trastuzumab. The clinicopathological features of the enrolled patients (n\u2009=\u2009344) are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1. ER+/Her2+ patients (136) represented 39.5%, and ER+/Her2\u2212 (57) represented 16.5%, ER\u2212/Her+ (78) represented 22.6%, while ER\u2212/Her2\u2212 (73) represented 21.4%. Remarkably, most of the patients (73.84%) were less than 50\u00a0years old, and the same proportion had high tumor stage, while about 43% of the tumors were of grade 3. Great proportion of patients have developed recurrence (41%) and 74 succumbed to their disease (Additional file 1: Table S1). Notably, most tumors were of big size with T2 and T3 representing 76% (Additional file 1: Table S1).High AUF1 level in LABC tumors is associated with poor survival. A Tissue sections cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumors (different subtypes) were immunostained with an anti-AUF1 antibody. The photographs were obtained using the light microscope Olympus BX53 (Envision 60x). Scale bar\u2009=\u200950\u00a0\u03bcm.

AUF1 immunostaining was assessed in breast cancer tissues in both epithelium and stroma (Fig.\u00a01A). The level AUF1 immunostaining was classified into 2 subgroups: low (<\u200910% AUF1 negative cells) and high (\u2265\u200910%, AUF1-positive cells). Additional file 2: Table S2 shows that the AUF1 level was low or completely lost in 251/344 fibroblasts and 188/344 cancer cells, and high in 85/344 fibroblasts and 147/344 cancer cells. The analysis of AUF1 expression in the different subtypes showed correlation with ER/Her2. Indeed, high level of AUF1 in fibroblasts or cancer cells was significantly associated with lack of ER or Her2 (P\u2009=\u20090.0005 and P\u2009=\u20090.0296, respectively) (Additional file 2: Table S2). Table 1 shows no correlation between AUF1expression level in both CAFs and cancer cells and tumor size, tumor stage and tumor recurrence. However, high AUF1 expression in both types of cells was significantly associated with higher tumor grade (P\u2009=\u20090.021 (fibroblasts) and P\u2009=\u20090.0295 (cancer cells)) (Table 1).AUF1

patient\u2019s overall survival (OS) as well as disease-free survival (DFS) (Fig.\u00a01B). Indeed, patients with tumors expressing high levels of AUF1 in fibroblasts had significantly poorer OS and DFS (Fig.\u00a01B). However, patients with tumors expressing low AUF1 in CAFs showed better survival (P\u2009=\u20090.085 and P\u2009=\u20090.012, respectively) (Fig.\u00a01B). No correlation was observed between AUF1 expression level in cancer cells and patient\u2019s survival (Fig.\u00a01B). Univariate Cox regression analysis also showed an increased risk for patients with high AUF1 levels in stromal fibroblasts (P\u2009=\u20090.0151) but not in cancer cells (Table 2). Next, multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted and showed that the AUF1 expression level in stromal fibroblasts is a significant independent predictor of DFS and OS (P\u2009=\u20090.0249, P\u2009=\u20090.0315, respectively) (Table 3).Next, the AUF1 level was assessed in the 4 main breast cancer subtypes. Figure\u00a01C shows a significant correlation between fibroblast AUF1-positivity and poor OS of ER+/Her2\u2212 and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (P\u2009=\u20090.049 and P\u2009=\u20090.010, respectively). However, no correlation was observed with the other subtypes (Fig.\u00a01C). AUF1 positivity in cancer cells showed association with poor OS and DFS of ER+/Her2+ patients (P\u2009=\u20090.085 and P\u2009=\u20090.183) (Additional file 3: Fig. S1). Figure\u00a01C shows a very strong correlation between high fibroblast AUF1 level and poor DFS of the TNBC patients (P\u2009=\u20090.003). However, no correlation was observed with the other subtypes (Fig.\u00a01C).Neoadjuvant therapy-dependent downregulation of AUF1 in tumors improves patient outcomeNeoadjuvant therapy-dependent downregulation of AUF1 in tumors improves patient survival. Tissue sections cut from paired FFPE obtained pre-treatment and post-treatment were immunostained with an anti-AUF1 antibody.

C Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Purple: AUF1 level down to\u2009<\u200910%, blue: AUF1 level not affected, green: AUF1 level up to\u2009\u2265\u200910%, brown: AUF1 level up/down but did not reach 10%Next, we sought to determine the effect of patient treatment on the expression of AUF1 in tumor and stromal cells. To this end, the expression of AUF1 was assessed on paired FFPE specimens collected pre- and post-treatment of each patient, for a total of 156 patients. The immunostaining results indicate downregulation, upregulation as well as no effect on the level of AUF1 in both cancer cells and their stromal adjacent fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a02A). Indeed, in cancer cells, AUF1 was downregulated in 46% cases and increased in only 20% cases, while 34% cases showed no change in AUF1 immunoreactivity (Additional file 4: Fig. S2). In fibroblasts, the AUF1 level decreased in only 22% cases and increased in 33% cases, while 45% cases showed no change in AUF1 immunoreactivity (Additional file 4: Fig. S2). This shows that for several patients, the effect of the treatment on AUF1 expression varies between cancer cells and their associated fibroblasts. Next, we investigated the effect of the neoadjuvant treatment on the expression of AUF1 among the tumors with high AUF1 immunoreactivity (\u2265\u200910%). Figure\u00a02B shows that while AUF1 downregulation (to a level\u2009<\u200910%) was highly significant in cancer cells (75%), it was not significant in fibroblasts (58.5%). This indicates that neoadjuvant therapy can reduce the AUF1 level (<\u200910%) in malignant cells in a significant number of tumors. This prompted us to test whether this AUF1 downregulation to a low level (<\u200910%) could affect patient survival. Kaplan\u2013Meier plots shown in Fig.\u00a02C indicate association between AUF1 downregulation in cancer cells and patient\u2019s disease-free survival (DFS) as well as overall survival (OS). Indeed, AUF1 downregulation to a low level (<\u200910%) improved the survival of the patients (Fig.\u00a02C). However, no association was observed between patient\u2019s survival and AUF1 downregulation in fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a02C).Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote carcinogenesisEctopic expression of AUF1 in BSFs promotes carcinogenesis in a paracrine manner. A TCF-64 cells were transfected with vectors either empty (TCF64-CTL) or bearing p37AUF1-ORF (TCF64-ORF). Whole cell lysates were prepared from these cells and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. B TCF64-CTL and TCF64-ORF cells were cultured in SFM for 24\u00a0h, and the respective SFCM (TCF64-CTL-SFCM and TCF64-ORF-SFCM) were collected and were used to treat the indicated BC cells for 24\u00a0h. Whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting analysis. The numbers below the bands represent fold change relative to the corresponding control after correction against the internal control, GAPDH. C Exponentially growing cells were added in SFM to the upper wells of the CIM plates either separated by a Matrigel basement membrane matrix (invasion) or without (migration), or E-plate (proliferation), and then, these capacities were assessed for the indicated periods of time using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System.

In order to elucidate the effect of AUF1 upregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts on breast carcinogenesis, we have first ectopically expressed AUF1 (p37) in normal breast fibroblasts (TCF64). TCF64 cells were infected with lentivirus-based vectors either empty (TCF64-CTL) or bearing the p37AUF1-ORF (TCF64-ORF). Figure\u00a03A shows upregulation of the 4 AUF1 isoforms in TCF64-ORF cells relative to controls. This could be mediated indirectly through the positive IL-6/STAT3 feedback loop. Next, TCF64-ORF and TCF64-CTL were cultured in serum-free medium for 24\u00a0h, and then, serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) were collected, TCF64-ORF-SFCM and TCF64-CTL-SFCM, respectively. The obtained SFCM were applied on two BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast cancer cells) and MCF-7 (luminal breast cancer cells) for 24\u00a0h, and then, whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis. Figure\u00a03B shows downregulation of the epithelial markers (EpCAM and E-cadherin) and upregulation of the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Twist1 and Snail1) in BC cells that were exposed to TCF64-ORF-SFCM as compared to controls. This suggests that breast fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 can enhance the EMT process in BC cells in a paracrine manner. This was confirmed by showing a clear increase in the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities of these BC cells upon exposure to TCF64-ORF-SFCM (Fig.\u00a03C). These findings prompted us to explore the possible promotion of stemness in these BC cells. Indeed, the exposure of both BC cell lines to TCF64-ORF-SFCM downregulated CD24 while upregulated CD44 and ALDH1 as compared to controls (Fig.\u00a03B). Flow cytometric analysis showed TCF64-ORF-SFCM-dependent increase in the proportion of CD44high/CD24low subpopulation of cells in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines, as compared to their respective controls (Fig.\u00a03D). Furthermore, the number of the formed tumorspheres was higher in BC cells that were exposed to TCF64-ORF-SFCM than in their respective controls (Fig.\u00a03E). These results indicate that BSFs that express high level of AUF1 have the capacity to promote EMT and stemness, two pro-metastatic processes, in breast cancer cells both ER+ and ER\u2212.Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote carcinogenesis in an IL-6-dependent paracrine mannerEctopic expression of AUF1 in BSFs promotes carcinogenesis in an IL-6-dependent paracrine manner. A The indicated SFCM were applied onto human cytokine antibody array membranes (C7). B The indicated SFCM were used to assess the level of IL-6 by ELISA, and error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u2009=\u20093) (**P\u2009<\u20090.01).

D Cells were treated as indicated, and the migration and proliferation capacities were assessed for the indicated periods of time using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. E Cells (1000) were cultured in ultra-low attachment 96-well plates in the presence of specific stem cell medium. Left panel, representative images of mammospheres. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcm. Right panel, Graphs depicting the number of formed mammospheres. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u2009=\u20093) (*P\u2009<\u20090.05)Next, we decided to determine the main factor responsible for the paracrine pro-carcinogenic promotion of BSFs that express high level of AUF1. To this end, TCF64-ORF-SFCM and TCF64-CTL-SFCM were applied on cytokine array, which showed higher secreted level of IL-6 in TCF64-ORF-SFCM than in TCF64-CTL-SFCM (Fig.\u00a04A). This was confirmed by ELISA, which showed a three-fold increase in the level of the secreted IL-6 from AUF1-expressing cells relative to their controls (Fig.\u00a04B). In order to confirm the role of BSF-secreted IL-6 in promoting EMT and stemness in BC cells, IL-6 was neutralized using a specific anti-IL-6 antibody in TCF64-ORF-SFCM, while IgG was used as negative control in both TCF64-ORF-SFCM and TCF64-CTL-SFCM. Interestingly, IL-6 inhibition in TCF64-ORF-SFCM upregulated the level of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCAM, while it reduced the expression level of\u00a0the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin and the stemness markers CD44 and ALDH1 as well as cyclin D1 in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 BC cells (Fig.\u00a04C). This IL-6 neutralization in TCF64-ORF-SFCM led to inhibition of cell proliferation, migration as well as self-renewal capacity of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 as compared to the respective controls (Fig.\u00a04D, E). This indicates that IL-6 mediates the pro-carcinogenic effects of BSFs that express high level of AUF1.Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote breast tumor growthBSFs that express high level of AUF1 promote tumor growth in mice. A Orthotopic breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with TCF64-ORF or TCF64-CTL cells into the mammary fat pads of nude mice (n\u2009=\u20095).

D Representative photographs of histologic sections subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and to anti\u2010Ki-67 antibody. Scale bar\u2009=\u200950\u00a0\u03bcm. E Protein extracts were prepared from the excised tumors and were used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers below the bands indicate fold changes relative to the control (T-TCF64-CTL) after normalization against GAPDHTo further show the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of AUF1-expressing fibroblasts, we decided to test this effect in vivo using orthotopic tumor xenografts. To this end, TCF64-ORF and TCF64-CTL cells (2.106) were co-injected with MDA-MB-231 cells (2.106) into the fat pad of nude mice. Interestingly, palpable tumors containing TCF64-ORF-SFCM (T-TCF64-ORF) cells were detected 2\u00a0weeks post-injection, while those containing the control cells (T-TCF64-CTL) became visible 3\u00a0weeks post-injection (Fig.\u00a05A). The graph shows also that the T-TCF64-ORF tumors grew faster than their corresponding controls (Fig.\u00a05A). The pictures of two obtained tumors from each group are depicted in Fig.\u00a05B, which shows that the tumors bearing TCF64-ORF-SFCM cells are much bigger than the control tumors. Next, tumors were excised and weighed and whole cell lysates were prepared. Interestingly, all the T-TCF64-ORF tumors are bigger and heavier than the T-TCF64-CTL tumors (Fig.\u00a05C). Hematoxylin and eosin staining on paraffin-embedded sections showed more necrosis in T-TCF64-CTL compared to T-TCF64-ORF. Moreover, Ki-67 level was higher in T-TCF64-ORF than in the respective controls (Fig.\u00a05D). This indicates that orthotopic breast tumors containing TCF64-ORF grew faster owing to their higher proliferative capacity than their corresponding control tumors. Figure\u00a05E shows that the presence of TCF64-ORF cells enhanced the expression of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin and reduced the expression of the epithelial markers EpCAM and E-cadherin. Furthermore, T-TCF64-ORF tumors expressed lower level of CD24 and higher levels of the stemness makers CD44, ALDH1 and OCT4 (Fig.\u00a05E). This indicates that the TCF64-ORF cells promoted the mesenchymal and the stemness features in the humanized breast cancer tumors in mice.Breast stromal fibroblasts that express high level of AUF1 promote chemoresistance in breast cancer cellsBSFs that express high level of AUF1 confer chemoresistance to BC cells in a paracrine fashion. A MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 and MCF-7 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells per well) were seeded in 96\u2010well plates and were incubated with TCF64-ORF-SFCM or TCF64-CTL-SFCM for 24\u00a0h and then were either sham-treated or challenged with different concentrations of cisplatin (30 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) or docetaxel (1 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h. Cell cytotoxicity was assessed using the WST1 assay and recorded as percent of survived cells relative to the untreated cells.

Whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins.

To this end, we incubated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with SFCM from TCF64-ORF or its corresponding control TCF64-CTL for 24\u00a0h, and then, cells were either sham-treated or challenged with cisplatin (30 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) or docetaxel (1 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h. The WST1 assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of both drugs. Figure\u00a06A shows that exposing BC cells to TCF64-ORF-SFCM resulted in a significant increase in their resistance to both cisplatin and docetaxel as compared to controls.To confirm these findings at the molecular level, immunoblotting analysis was performed to evaluate the level of the important pro-apoptotic proteins PARP and caspase-9 in pre-treated BC cells. The obtained results indicate that TCF64-ORF-SCFM reduced the cisplatin- and docetaxel-dependent increase in the level of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-9 as compared to controls for both cell lines (Fig.\u00a06B, C). These results reveal that BSFs that express high level of AUF1 protect breast cancer cells from the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and docetaxel in a paracrine manner.DiscussionLABC, the most aggressive BC subtype, remains a challenging clinical problem in most developing countries with high disease relapse and poor survival rates. In order to improve the treatment of these patients, it is crucial to identify biomarkers with efficient predictive value. Thereby, we sought in the present study to evaluate the prognostic/predictive power of the expression level of AUF1 in patients suffering LABC. We have first shown significant association between high AUF1 level in both CAFs and cancer cells and high tumor grade (P\u2009=\u20090.0021 and P\u2009=\u20090.0295, respectively). Furthermore, high AUF1 level in fibroblasts was associated with poor DFS and OS, which was confirmed by univariate Cox regression analysis. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the AUF1 level in stromal fibroblasts is a significant independent predictor of DFS and OS (P\u2009=\u20090.0249, P\u2009=\u20090.0315, respectively). On the other hand, AUF1 level in cancer cells was not associated with survival of LABC patients.When AUF1 level was assessed in the four well-defined breast cancer subtypes, we have found that AUF1-positive stromal fibroblasts were significantly correlated with poor survival of both ER+/Her2\u2212 and ER\u2212/Her2\u2212 patients (Fig.\u00a01C). Similarly, high expression of AUF1 in malignant cells tended to be associated with shorter survival of ER+/Her2+ patients. These findings indicate that the expression level of AUF1 in breast CAFs has a powerful prognostic value for TNBC as well as ER+/Her2\u2212 patients. In fact, several lines of evidence point to the key role of CAFs in modulating the response of breast cancer patients to various types of therapies.Additionally, we have observed significant neoadjuvant therapy-dependent change in the expression of AUF1 in malignant cells, with AUF1 downregulation in 46% of cases. Importantly, AUF1 downregulation to a level lower than 10% (cutoff) in tumors was significantly associated with better OS and DFS (P\u2009=\u20090.043 and P\u2009=\u20090.039, respectively). However, this decrease was not significant in CAFs, and therefore, it did not improve survival. This shows the importance of developing specific anti-AUF1 inhibitors for more efficient precision medicine.It has been recently shown that AUF1 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines and this was associated with a poor prognosis. This shows that the importance of AUF1 as prognostic biomarker may not be limited to BC but could be also highly informative for other types of cancer.We have previously shown that AUF1 is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to their paired counterparts, and also, AUF1 plays a major role in the activation of BSFs. Thereby, in order to provide a molecular explanation as to the association between high AUF1 expression in CAFs and the unfavorable prognosis, we investigated the paracrine effects of BSFs that ectopically express AUF1 on breast cancer cells. We have shown that AUF1 upregulation in BSFs promotes EMT and stemness in breast cancer cells in an IL-6-dependent manner. More importantly, AUF1-expressing BSFs enhanced the resistance of BC cells to the cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of platinum as well as docetaxel chemotherapeutic agents. This indicates that AUF1 upregulation in BSFs promotes carcinogenesis and also reduces the response of BC cells to various chemotherapeutic agents, which explains the poor outcome of patients with tumors expressing high level of AUF1 in their stromal fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01). This suggests that breast fibroblast AUF1 could be considered as a novel prognostic biomarker, which could also be specifically targeted for precision therapy of BC patients.The prognostic power of breast CAFs has been previously shown based on the expression level of different genes such as CAV-1, \u03b1-SMA, FAP-\u03b1, podoplanin and others. Furthermore, we have recently shown that ATR-negative CAFs predict a poor OS as well as DFS for breast cancer patients.ConclusionsTogether, these findings indicate that breast CAFs have important predictive/prognostic power that should be taken into consideration for the stratification and precise treatment of these patients, especially the hard-to-treat form of the disease (TNBC). This is due to the fact that these genetically stable and relatively abundant non-cancerous stromal cells have the ability to promote tumor growth, progression as well as the response to various anticancer agents. This also indicates that personalized CAFs-targeted therapies may enable more efficient therapeutic responses.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCSCsCancer stem cellsEMTEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionORFOpen reading frameNBFsNormal breast fibroblastsTCFsTumor counterpart fibroblastsTMETumor microenvironmentPublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Taher Al-Tweigeri and Noura N.

Cancer tissues consist of various cells include cancer cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, immune cells and various bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. Fibroblasts are the most enriched cells in tumor stroma. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the cancer niche build a permissive and supportive microenvironment for tumor development. Fibroblasts play important roles in cancer progression including metabolism, metastasis, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and chemo-resistance by interaction with cancer cells or other cells. Fibroblasts could affect behaviors of cancer cells by activating signal pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs), and soluble molecules and so on.MiRNAs are a type of non-coding small RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of its target genes. More and more research focus on the roles of miRNAs in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts secrete a variety of chemokines, growth factors, cytokines, which can be regulated by miRNAs. Down-regulation of miR-149, miR-21, miR-409, miR-26b, miR-205, miR-31 and up-regulation of miR-34b and miR-34c expression could transform resident fibroblasts to carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The reported miRNAs could regulate gene expression in fibroblasts and then control cancer development and progression by regulating cytokines or chemokines. Chemokines are critical signaling mediators, which involve in the communication between the cancer cells and fibroblasts through binding to their receptors. Cell survival, proliferation, stem cell properties, ECM attachment, adhesion, metastasis in tissues or to other organs including proteolysis of the basement membrane, locomotion and colony formation will be changed according to the signals from the CAFs.Our previous screening data showed that miR-29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in CAFs. Our study is to determine how miR-29b influences chemokine secretion of CAFs and its role in the regulation of proliferation, drug resistance and metastasis of breast cancer cells.RESULTSMiR-29b expression down-regulates in CAFsCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the tissues of breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA is the most common marker of CAFs, and it was significantly up-regulated in CAFs than in NFs using immunofluorescence assay (Figure 1A). The markers of CAFs including MCT1, MCT4, \u03b1-SMA and FSP1 were examined by western blotting. It was found that MCT1, MCT4, \u03b1-SMA and FSP1 protein levels were higher than them in NFs, but CAV-1 was significantly down-regulated in CAFs (Figure 1B). Cell proliferation was assayed for SKBR3 with conditioned medium (CM) from NFs or CAFs treatment by colony formation assay (Figure 1C). The results indicated that CAFs were different from NFs, and CAFs showed the features of the activated fibroblasts. It was also shown that CAFs promoted cell migration of SKBR3 cells (Figure 1D\u20131E).Lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs(A) \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs and NFs by immunofluorescence assay.

The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, and -: no significance.To know the role of miRNAs in CAFs, miRNA array was performed to find the significant miRNAs. MiR-29b is one of the down-regulated miRNA in CAFs (Supplementary Table 1). It was also found that miR-29b including miR-29b-1-5p (miR-29b-1) and miR-29b-2-5p (miR-29b-2) were down-regulated in CAFs compared to NFs (Figure 1F\u20131G). These indicated that miR-29b may play a suppressing role in CAFs.CAFs with miR-29b inhibits breast cancer cellular growthTo further investigate the role of miR-29b in CAFs on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and their expression increased (Supplementary Figure 1). Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 could inhibit cell survival in three breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7 and SKBR3 (Figure 2A\u20132B). Next, colony formation assay was used for evaluate cell survival ability. It was shown that miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression in CAFs reduced the number of colonies of breast cancer cells, specially, in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2C\u20132D). Cell cycle, reflecting the cell proliferation, was analyzed by flow cytometry in breast cancer cells after co-culturing CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression. The result showed that miR-29b-1 and miR-29b-2 could decrease the ratio of G1, G2/M phase and increase S phase in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 2E\u20132F). Breast cancer models were set up using nude mice injected with MCF-7 cells and used to verify the effect of miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 on cell growth in vivo. It was found that MCF-7 cells mixed with CAFs could accelerate tumor growth than MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells mixed with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpressed CAFs attenuated tumor growth (Figure 2G). There was a similar result in breast cancer models using BT474 cells (Figure 2H). These data suggested that CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression suppressed breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.CAFs enhances breast cancer cellular viability by down-regulation of miR-29b(A-B) CAFs were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 mimics for 24h and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells.

The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01.MiR-29b regulates the expression of cytokines in CAFsThe bioinformatics analysis showed that 3\u2032-UTRs of the CCL11, CCL18, CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17 contain the binding sites with miR-29b-1 (Supplementary Figure 2). 3\u2032-UTRs of the CCL11, CCL4L1, CCL4L2 and CXCL14 have the binding sites of miR-29b-2 (Supplementary Figure 3). To know whether miR-29b regulates the expression of the predicted targeted cytokines, activated CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts (Hs578BstCM) were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and the mRNA levels of endogenous cytokines were measured by real time RT-PCR. The results showed that CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA decreased when CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1, and the mRNA levels of CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17 were slightly decreased (Figure 3A). CCL11 and CXCL14 mRNA decreased when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2, but mRNAs of CCL4L1 and CCL4L2 were not changed significantly (Figure 3B).MiR-29b regulates CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in fibroblasts(A) miR-29b-1 restoration down-regulated CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA in CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts treated with conditioned medium from cancer (Hs578BstCM).

Cells were transfected with miR-29b-2 or miR-control for 48 hours, then collected for real-time PCR. (C-D) miR-29b-1 suppressed the expression of a luciferase reporter gene harboring the 3\u2032-UTR of CCL11 or CCL18. (E-F) miR-29b-2 suppressed the expression of a luciferase reporter gene harboring the 3\u2032-UTR of CCL11 and CXCL14. (G) Cells were transfected with miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2 or miR-control for 48 hours, then collected for ELISA. (I) Cells were transfected with miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2 or miR-control for 48 hours, then collected for western blotting. The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *:p<0.05, **: p<0.01.Next, to confirm that CCL11 and CCL18 were the target genes of miR-29b-1 and CCL11 and CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b-2, plasmids with 3\u2032 UTR of CCL11, CCL18 and CXCL14 were constructed. CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected with CCL11, CCL18 or CXCL14 3\u2032 UTRs and miR-29b, and luciferase activities were assayed. The results showed that the luciferase activities of wide types of CCL11 and CCL18 3\u2032 UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-1 were much lower than miRNA controls (Figure 3C\u20133D). The luciferase activities of wide types of CCL11 and CXCL14 3\u2032 UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 were much lower than miRNA controls (Figure 3E\u20133F). CCL11, CCL18 protein levels decreased significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1(Figure 3G\u20133H). CCL11, CCL14 protein levels decreased significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2 (Figure 3G\u20133H). CCL11 and CXCL14 protein decreased in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 transfection by western blotting (Figure 3I). When miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 was suppressed in MCF-7 cells, CCL11 and CXCL14 were inhibited at mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Figure 4). So, the data clearly indicated that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the direct target genes of miR-29b in CAFs or Hs579BstCM.MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast cancer cellular viability and metastasis by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14To further investigate the role of miR-29b in fibroblasts on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected with miR-29b and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells exposed to CCL11 and CXCL14 (10ng/ml) for 24h. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR-29b could inhibit breast cancer cell survival and also suppressed cell growth by CCL11 and CXCL14 stimulation (Figure 4A\u20134B). MiR-29b could inhibit breast cancer cell migration via CCL11 or CXCL14 from CAFs (Figure 4C\u20134D). Breast cancer cell invasion ability was also inhibited by miR-29b, which could suppress CCL11 and CXCL14 enhanced invasion (Figure 4E\u20134F). When the cells were transfected miR-29-1 or miR-29-2 inhibitors, cell survival ability and migration were enhanced (Supplementary Figure 5).MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast cancer cellular viability and metastasis by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14CAFs were transfected with miR-29b mimics or treated with CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24h and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells. (A-B) MTT assay was used to test cell proliferation at day 3. (C-D) Cell migration was assayed by transwell chamber system. (E-F) Cell invasion was assayed by transwell chamber system. The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01.CAFs with low level of miR-29b increases breast cancer cell drug resistance by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14CAFs could induce drug resistance of cancer cells. Here, to know whether there are differences of miR-29b down-regulation on drug resistance of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14. The cell survival rates were examined using colony formation assay. The results indicated that CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 could lead to breast cancer cells growing more slowly than breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs treatment, which had higher survival ability than the parent cells (Figure 5A\u20135B). Cell apoptosis was also examined in the MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 with paclitaxel or CCL11 or CXCL14 treatment for 24 hours. It was shown that MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 showed more apoptosis rates than the cells with CM-CAFs treatment (Figure 5C\u20135D).CAFs with miR-29b down-regulation regulates breast cancer cell drug resistance by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14(A-B) MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and then exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24 hours. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for two weeks and cell survival ability was evaluated using colony formation assay. (C-D) MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and then exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24 hours. Cells were labeled with AnnexinV and apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry. The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01.Lack of miR-29b levels in CAFs activates p38-STAT1 pathway in breast cancer cellsTo explore the signal pathway involved in miR-29b stimulation, MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells were exposed to CM-CAFs or CM-CAFs/miR-29b and the protein extraction was for western blotting. We found that p38 was activated in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs treatment, however, in the CM-CAFs/miR-29b or STAT1 is one of down-stream transcriptional factor of p38 and it was also inhibited in the breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b or CM-CAFs/miR-29b treatment. CM-CAFs/miR-29b treated cells decreased the activated p38 (Figure 6A and 6B). Other down-stream gene such as ELK1 and PAX6 were also changed.MiR-29b down-regulation in CAFs activates p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells(A) p38 and p38 down-stream gene expression in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 and CCL11 treatment.

The data are shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, and -: no significance.To know whether STAT1 involves in the chemokine expression of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA or treated with STAT1 inhibitor, CCL11 and CXCL14 were assayed by ELISA. The results showed that inhibition of STAT1 could reduce the levels of CCL11 and CXCL14 (Figure 6C). When the cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA and treated with CCL11 or CXCL14, cell proliferation enhancement by CCL11 or CXCL14 was inhibited in the cells with STAT1 down-regulation (Figure 6D). The results from MTT assay indicated that inhibition of STAT1 suppressed the cell survival ability significantly in MCF-7 cells.DISCUSSIONAlthough the stromal cells in the tumor environment including fibroblasts are not malignant, their altered gene expression profiles influence the cellular function and signal pathways of stroma cells, tumor cell behaviors by the communication between tumor cells and stroma. Fibroblasts are the most common cell type found in the tumor microenvironment and usually activated to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) due to the signals from the microenvironment, which are responsible for the synthesis of proteins involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as secretion of growth factors that regulate tumor cell proliferation, survival and dissemination. In the present study, we identified that miR-29b was the important molecule for the regulation of chemokines' expression in CAFs.MiRNAs have been implicated in the activation of fibroblasts. There are reports showed that miR-31, miR-148a and others are down-regulated in activated fibroblasts. Previous study showed that miR-29b is down-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer. Our study showed that miR-29b was down-regulated in CAFs, when miR-29b was introduced into CAFs, the characteristics of CAFs were like NFs (not shown). MiR-29b acts as a tumor suppressor in most cancer types. Our results supported that miR-29b plays a suppressor role in tumor stroma.There are reports shown that fibroblasts involve in the cross-talk of cancer cells and fibroblasts by secreting CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL12, IL6, CXCL16 and others. In the study, we identified that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b in fibroblasts. When miR-29b expression is downregulated in CAFs or activated fibroblasts, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression were significantly higher than the normal fibroblasts. CCL11 and CXCL14 could secret to the outside of the cells and they mainly exist in the extracellular microenvironment. MiR-29b was shown as a negative regulator of CCL11 and CXCL14, but not other chemokines predicted listing in Figure 2. When the CAFs or activated fibroblasts were transfected with miR-29b mimics, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in the culture media were suppressed. CCL11 and CXCL14 from the CAFs will exert on breast cancer cell and then promotes cell proliferation and metastasis. Further molecular mechanism exploration indicated CCL11 and CXCL14 could active p38-STAT1 pathway in breast cancer cells. Our findings showed that lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs could promote CCL11 and CXCL14 expression, which activate p38 and then promote cell proliferation and metastasis.The selected significant miRNAs from the CAFs and NFsCAFs/NFs>2 meant that miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in CAFs. CAFs/NFs<0.5 meant that miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in CAFs.\t \tIn a conclusion, as shown in Figure 6E, our study elucidated that lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs could promote cellular viability and metastasis by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells by up-regulation of CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in CAFs. STAT1 could promote CCL11, CXCL14 and CCL2 production and then accelerate cell proliferation. This is a positive feedback process. There need more studies to evaluate the function of other miRNAs aberrantly regulated in CAFs and their network. Revealing the molecular mechanisms involved in CAFs-mediated cancer growth and progression may be beneficial for finding new cancer therapy targets.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cultureThe breast cancer cell lines were originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Fibroblasts Hs578Bst were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Hybri-Care Medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) with 30 ng/ml EGF, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. All the cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Isolation and culture of cancer-associated fibroblastsCarcinoma associated fibroblasts were isolated referred to the previously reports from five breast cancer tissues, which were diagnosed with mammary ductal carcinoma. The experiment was obtained the agreement from the Institutional Review Board of our hospital. The fresh breast cancer tissue samples were washed and kept in PBS containing antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 1.5g/ml Fungizone) (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) at 4\u00b0C. The tissues were cutted into about 2 mm fragments and then digested overnight at 37\u00b0C with 0.1% collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) in DMEM and 10% FBS. The following day, the epithelial cells were separated by centrifuge. The stromal cells were washed in PBS and cultured. All experiments were performed before the 10th passage. In addition, normal fibroblasts (2cm from breast cancer tissues) were isolated according to the CAFs isolation.Co-culturing of breast cancer cells and fibroblasts and conditioned medium preparationCAFs and NFs were co-cultured with breast cancer cells with the ratio at 1:1. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% FBS supplemented with 10% FBS in a 37\u00b0C humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for 24 hours, and then washed for three times with PBS and finally cultured in 3ml serum free DMEM/F12 media for 2 hours. Conditioned medium was collected and filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Merck Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) to remove cellular debris.ReagentsAntibodies against MCT-1, MCT-4, FSP1, CAV-1, \u03b1-SMA, phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), p38, PAX6, STAT1, and total \u03b2-actin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human chemokines kits were purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA).Real time RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from the cells with the indicated treatment using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was qualified and performed for real time RT-PCR analysis. The primers sequences used in this study were provided in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Table 1). The relative miRNA or mRNA levels were calculated by comparing Ct values of the samples with those of the reference, all data normalized to the internal control GAPDH or U6 snRNA.Western blot analysisCells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, and 25 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Coomassie blue method (Pierce Chemical Corp.). Whole-cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with various primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase\u2013labeled secondary antibodies. The signals were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Promega).ShRNA lentivirus vector constructionShRNA lentiviral particle delivery system was used to generate STAT1 siRNA, and STAT1-silenced tumor cell lines were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA).

Following the indicated treatments, 10 mg/mL methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added (50 \u03bcL/well), and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 hours. The cells were then lysed with a lysis buffer (500\u03bcL/well) containing 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in dimethyl formamide/H2O (1:1, v/v; pH 4.7) at 37\u00b0C for at least 6 hours. The relative number of surviving cells in each group was determined by measuring the optical density (OD) of the cell lysates at an absorbance wavelength of 570 nm.Cell colony formationThe cells were harvested, sparsely plated, and were cultured under the normal condition. The medium underwent the replacement at three-day intervals. And then the cells were fixed in 90% ethanol, stained with crystal violet and colonies consisting of at least 50 cells so they were counted ten days later.Cell cycleIn 2ml culture medium 2\u00d7105 cells/well (6-well plate) were seeded, and cultured for the indicated time before collection.

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity.

C, Percentage of case distribution according to immunoreactivity of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF in tumor cells, the score for negative (0), low (1 to 2) and high (3 to 4).DiscussionWhile p21 was initially characterized as an important cell cycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic p21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatory functions. The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

        "content": "The biological heterogeneity of breast cancer leads to the need for finding new approaches to understand the mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression. The tumor stroma appears as a key in the progression of solid tumors towards a malignant phenotype. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may orchestrate a functional \"corrupted\" stroma which in turn helps metastatic spread. In this study, we investigated by real-time PCR, the expression of 19 factors by normal breast-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) and CAFs, which were implicated in several actions promoting tumor growth, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation and invasion. Also, we explored the influence of inflammatory cells phenotypes (MMP11 status) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) on the molecular profile of CAFs. If we consider that one of the major sources of CAFs are resident NAFs, the transition of NAFs into CAFs is associated with molecular changes involving the overexpression of some molecular factors of biological importance in tumor progression. In addition, the characterization of the tumor stroma regarding to the MMP11 status by MICs reflects a type of fibroblasts which contribute even more to tumor progression. Moreover, different patterns in the induction of the expression of factors by CAFs were observed, depending on the tumor cell line which they were co-cultured with. Furthermore, CAFs influence TGF\u03b2 expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, this study can help to a better characterization of tumor stroma in order to improve the prognostic evaluation, as well as to define the different populations of CAFs as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Histological examinations of human tumors show greater stromal content in more advanced and larger tumors, and high content of stromal cells correlates with greater risk of relapse and reduced survival. Fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cell type in epithelial tumors. Cancer cells dynamically activate surrounding fibroblasts to produce growth factors, hormones, and cytokines that fuel tumor growth, and facilitate progression to metastasis. These activated fibroblasts, termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulate cancer cells through paracrine signaling and direct intercellular interactions. In a study of breast carcinoma, about 80 percent of fibroblasts exhibited an activated phenotype.Production of the chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1) is a hallmark feature of CAFs. CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors upregulated on cancer cells, and activates multiple molecular pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Signaling through these pathways promotes survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly active in breast cancers. Analysis of human breast tumors showed that among the different molecular subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells have the most elevated expression of CXCR4. Considering the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, disrupting this chemokine signaling may offer a potential new therapeutic approach. In addition, investigating pathways downstream of this chemokine signaling axis in TNBC cells potentially will unveil new molecular targets for therapy.Studies of interactions among stroma and cancer cells typically use monolayer cell cultures or xenograft models. Monolayer cultures lack the complexity of tumors including a compact three-dimensional morphology, close intercellular contacts, exposure of cells to gradients of soluble factors and oxygen, and non-uniform, spatially-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, cells in monolayer cultures often fail to reproduce key characteristics of tumors. Xenografts present a physiological system for cancer research. However, they are limited in terms of absence of human tumor stroma, failure of some murine cytokines to activate human receptors, disparities in dynamics of tumor growth and progression compared to human tumors, and need for complex tools and biological assays to study stromal effects on cancer cells. Since the introduction of tissue microarrays and next generation sequencing, these technologies have been used for high throughput assessment of biomarkers in thousands of tumor samples from biopsies using standard assays such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridization. These technologies are an invaluable tool in clinical oncology to develop diagnostic tests and identify disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, tissue microarrays and similar biopsy-based assays for endpoint analysis of fixed samples do not capture dynamic tumor-stromal interactions in tumor microenvironments. Tumors constantly transform both spatially and temporally. Interactions between stromal and cancer cells play a major role in conferring functional changes to cancer cells such as gain of cancer stem cell and mesenchymal characteristics, altered metabolism, drug resistance, migration and invasion, and survival. Mechanistic understanding of these complex events in tumors requires approaches that reproduce dynamic signaling of cancer and stromal cells as it occurs in native tissues.Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of cells as spheroids provide relevant in vitro tumor models to recapitulate architecture and complex intercellular network of tumors and emulate stromal-cancer cells interactions. We recently developed a robotic, high throughput spheroid microprinting technology to mass produce homogenously-sized spheroids that exhibit key biology properties of solid tumors. Here, we utilized this technology and formed an array of co-culture spheroids of TNBC and stromal cells to examine CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on TNBC cells. Using different cellular assays and molecular analyses, we demonstrated that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling significantly increases spheroid proliferation and TNBC cell growth. This signaling conferred resistance to standard chemotherapy drug treatment through activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. We found that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling induces sensitivity of the cancer cells to specific molecular inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways, preventing proliferation of TNBC cells. This work establishes the feasibility of studying tumor-stromal interactions using our engineered solid tumor models and offers a convenient preclinical tool to identify new treatment approaches.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting of TNBC-stromal cells co-culture spheroidsThe ATPS technology facilitates partitioning of cancer and stromal cells to the DEX phase nanodrop to spontaneously form a mono-culture or a co-culture spheroid within 24\u201348 hours of incubation (Figure 1A\u20131B). Importantly, nutrients and waste products of cells freely diffuse between the DEX phase nanodrop and the immersion PEG phase. Adapting the technology to robotics enabled formation of spheroids in standard 384-microwell plates. For co-culture spheroids, we selected a ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells and a total cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/0.3 \u03bcl of DEX phase drop. This ratio was to mimic more advanced and larger human breast tumors that have greater stromal content than cancer cells. Using larger ratios of 1:3 and 1:4 (breast cancer cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial breast cancer cell density constant at 5 \u00d7 103 cells per DEX phase drop did not alter growth of TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure 1), consistent with other studies. This microprinting approach gave consistently-sized mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells), mono-culture spheroids of fibroblast cells, HMF and CAFs, (1 \u00d7 104 cells), and co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF cells or CAFs (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells with a 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells ratio) (Figure 1C). The spheroid size consistency was measured from two separate experiments to ensure that spheroids of each model had a similar initial metabolic activity baseline. Importantly, the 1.5 \u00d7 104 cell density co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells or CAFs were not statistically different in size (p > 0.05), eliminating potential effects of size differences of the spheroids on the studies reported below. We conveniently maintained spheroids in the same 384-microwell plate used for spheroid formation by robotic exchange of culture medium.(A\u2013B) Cancer cells remain confined in the 0.3 \u00b5l DEX phase drop (purple) suspended in the immiscible immersion PEG phase (pink) and autonomously aggregate to form a co-culture spheroid of triple negative breast cancer cells (green) and human mammary fibroblasts (red) in 48 hrs. Colors in panel (A) are for presentation purpose only. (C) Resulting spheroids of different co-culture models are consistently sized with low standard errors.Effect of TNBC-stromal cells signaling on cellular metabolic activity of spheroidsTo investigate the effect of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 receptors on the proliferation of cells in 3D cultures, we generated eight different co-culture spheroids that contained at least one element of this chemokine-receptor(s) signaling or completely lacked them: (i) TNBC:HMF, (ii) TNBC:CAFs, (iii) CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, (iv) CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, (v) CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, (vi) CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, (vii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and (viii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. The co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF that lacked this signaling served as the global negative control. Spheroids were evaluated for their cellular proliferation over a six-day period following formation and in medium containing only 1% FBS at the starting point and no renewal (Figure 2A). The TNBC:CAFs model displayed either a lower or fairly similar activity compared to the TNBC:HMF model, indicating that CXCL12 production by CAFs does not confer growth advantage to TNBC cells lacking the cognate receptors of the chemokine. On the other hand, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model showed overall the highest and continuously increasing activity throughout the culture compared to all the other co-culture spheroids. The CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model also consistently showed 11\u201328% greater activity than its CXCR4+TNBC:HMF counterpart lacking the CXCL12 chemokine as determined by a linear regression analysis. There was no significant difference between cell proliferation in CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids. Interestingly, these models even had lower activity level than the TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs spheroids on each day of measurement. When the effect of expression of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cell proliferation was evaluated, the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs model had slightly increased activity, up to 4.5%, than the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF spheroids on certain days. Our statistical analysis of the multivariate, temporally-dependent data resulting from all eight co-culture spheroid models showed that cell proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was significantly different from the seven other models across the six-day culture period (Figure 2B).(A) Growth of co-culture spheroids based on metabolic activity measurements is shown over a six-day period. Spheroids consist of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells at a ratio of 1:2 TNBC:fibroblasts at the starting point of experiments. (B) p-values from a statistical test show that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model is consistently and significantly more proliferative than all the other models.Consistent with reports in mouse models, our finding suggests that the CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 axis is a key mediator of cell proliferation in breast cancer. The effect of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling on promoting primary and metastatic breast tumor growth has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. Several studies have reported that CXCR7 is a scavenger receptor to prevent saturation of CXCR4 receptors and also to create CXCL12 gradients to facilitate migration of CXCR4+ cancer cells. This provides a plausible explanation for the similar activity levels of the CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture models. We note that the role of the CXCR7 receptor in the presence of CXCL12 signaling remains disputed. For example, studies show that CXCR7 expression lead to growth of primary breast tumors in rat models through promoting angiogenesis, which is consistent with data showing upregulation of this receptor on tumor vasculature. However, results from these studies cannot be correlated with those from our 3D cultures that represent models of avascular tumors. Altogether, these data demonstrate that our 3D cultures recapitulate growth properties of breast tumors. Based on analysis of the data, we selected the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and its respective negative control, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, for mechanistic studies of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling in TNBC.Inhibition and stimulation of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingWe conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate if the higher proliferative activity of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was indeed due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling. The experiments included an inhibition test and a stimulation test. First, we treated spheroids with AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 that blocks the CXCR4 receptor. Consistently throughout the six-day culture, this treatment reduced proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model that lacks CXCL12 (Figure 3A). Next, we treated the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium of CAFs. This stimulation elevated the proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 3B). In both cases, our analysis showed minimal statistically significant differences between the treated and non-treated co-culture models. Collectively, these results established that greater proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model than the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroid model was due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling.(A) Treatment of CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) normalizes proliferation to level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture. (B) Treating CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium from CAFs stimulates proliferation to that of CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids.Evaluation of cancer cell growth in spheroids due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingThe above study based on metabolic activity of cells provided a measure of stromal-cancer cells signaling effect on the overall growth of spheroids. Considering that activated stromal cells (CAFs) in breast tumors also proliferate, we investigated to what extent greater overall growth results from proliferation of CXCR4+ TNBC cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids compared with other spheroid models shown in Figure 2A. Measurements of the endogenous eGFP signal of the cancer cells showed that cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display a statistically significant (p < 0.05) growth increase throughout the measurement window (Figure 4A). Linear regression analysis showed that CXCR4+TNBC cells in this model had an 11.4% larger growth slope over time than their counterparts in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. This indicates that CAFs confer increasingly greater proliferative activity to the breast cancer cells. To validate this result, we evaluated growth of cancer cells in co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs that lacked both elements of the signaling axis or CXCR4 receptor expression, respectively. Despite some random differences in growth of cancer cells between the two models on several days, the slope of linear regression was smaller by 2% in the co-culture containing CAFs (Figure 4B). Thus, these results established the role of CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling on enhanced growth of breast cancer cells.Proliferation of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids measured using their endogenous eGFP signal(A) TNBC cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display consistently greater proliferation compared to spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture model and CXCR4+TNBC single culture with a larger slope of 11.4% and 77.1%, respectively. (B) TNBC cells lacking CXCR4 expression in co-culture with HMF and CAFs show a similar proliferation. (C\u2013D) Morphology of resulting co-culture spheroids and mono-culture spheroids of breast cancer cells on days 1, 3, and 6 (left to right). Error bars represent standard error of mean. (E\u2013F) Confocal images of the co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells on day 4. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.TNBC cells in all four co-culture spheroid models displayed a larger growth than their respective mono-culture spheroids generated with the same density of 5 \u00d7 103 breast cancer cells. The slope of linear regression of growth curves was 5.0 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and TNBC:CAFs co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. Similarly, the regression line slope was 4.4 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and TNBC:HMF co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. This implies a major role for heterotypic cellular signaling in tumors and suggests that breast cancer cells induce the normal fibroblasts to produce soluble factors to promote growth of malignant cells. Studies show that cancer cells produce growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) that activate the adjacent stromal cells, which in turn secrete signaling molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to promote proliferation of cancer cells. The larger growth rate of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids compared to the respective CXCR4+TNBC mono-culture spheroids may be mediated by soluble factors secreted by CXCR4-expressing cancer cells to transform HMF cells to CAFs.Morphologically, mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and TNBC became more compact by day six of culture. Co-culturing breast cancer cells and fibroblasts significantly enhanced compactness of spheroids earlier, indicating that fibroblasts facilitate spheroid formation of breast cancer cells (Figure 4C\u20134D). The co-culture models containing CXCR4+TNBC cells exhibited a compact morphology for several days with minimal increases of volume (9\u201315%) from days 1 to 3. But over time, the co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and HMF cells showed separation of fibroblast and cancer cells with an 82% volume increase from days 3 to 6. This is likely due to the expression of incompatible junctional proteins in breast cancer and fibroblast cells. For example, it was shown that intercellular adhesion was dependent on cadherins expression of each cell type, and only cells that expressed the same type of cadherins intermixed. Notably, the separation behavior was observed considerably more in the TNBC:HMF co-culture model and was further demonstrated through confocal imaging in Figure 4E\u20134F. Expression of CXCR4 on TNBC cells largely prevented separation from HMF cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. Additionally, inclusion of CAFs, regardless of CXCR4 expression on TNBC cells, blocked the segregation effect and helped the spheroids retain a compact morphology, mimicking the unique characteristic of CAFs to infiltrate tumor masses. All spheroids displayed shedding of TNBC cells from their peripheries on later days of culture, suggesting that active proliferation of border cells is somewhat compensated by cell shedding. We note that a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these morphological differences in co-culture spheroids requires a more extensive analysis.Molecular analysis of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on cancer cell proliferation in spheroidsWe evaluated proliferation of both breast cancer and stromal cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids using IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids and quantifying Ki-67+ proliferative cells. Breast cancer and stromal cells showed statistically significant higher proliferation (p < 0.05) in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 5). When co-cultured with CAFs, the CXCR4+TNBC cells showed 1.4 times greater Ki-67 staining, in agreement with results based on eGFP signal measurements (Figure 4). Additionally, CAFs in the co-culture model had a remarkably two-fold higher Ki-67 staining compared to HMF cells. This is consistent with increased proliferation of CAFs in tumor tissues, and the overall greater stromal content in more aggressive and larger tumors. We note that the CAFs secrete mCherry-tagged CXCL12 into the medium, whereas the HMF cells contain mCherry signal in their nuclei. This is the reason for visual differences between the red fluorescence images of CAFs and HMF cells in Figure 5. To avoid relying on the mCherry signal for quantification of cell proliferation, we used the Ki-67+ and eGFP signal of breast cancer cells to quantify proliferative TNBC cells, and then subtracted this value from the total Ki-67+ fluorescence to quantify proliferation of stromal cells (CAFs or HMF) in their respective co-cultures.Proliferation of CXCR4+TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HMF and CAFs) in co-culture spheroids characterized through measurements of Ki-67+ proliferative cells using immunostained images of cryosections of 4-day old spheroids. Both cancer cells and fibroblasts show significantly greater proliferation in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model (blue bars). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Next, we investigated molecular mechanisms for increased proliferation of stromal and breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 axis may activate multiple pathways in cancer cells. We focused on ERK and AKT, two prominent drivers of proliferation in breast cancer and other malignancies. Western blot analysis relative to the total protein and \u03b2-actin expression of each co-culture system showed that cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids had moderately higher levels of p-ERK (Figure 6A) and substantially higher levels of p-AKT (Figure 6B) compared to CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. The displayed immunoblots were quantified (normalized to their respective total and \u03b2-actin protein expressions), showing an 81% increase in the p-AKT/t-AKT levels and a 16% increase in p-ERK/t-ERK levels in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids. Although p-ERK increase is modest, small changes in activation of MAPK components produce much larger effects on overall signaling and biologic outputs. These results suggest that the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling upregulates activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways to support TNBC cells metabolic and growth activities.Western blot analysis of signaling proteins (A) p-ERK and (B) p-AKT in co-cultures of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF and CAFs. Quantified data were normalized to \u03b2-actin protein expression.To further substantiate these results, we conducted IHC analysis of cryosections of co-culture spheroids for ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 7A\u20137B, 7D\u20137E). Quantification of immunostained sections (normalized to total protein expression and highest fluorescent value obtained) showed a similar pattern to Western blotting with a 52% and 28% increase in p-AKT/t-AKT and p-ERK/t-ERK levels, respectively, in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 7C, 7F). We note that high levels of ERK and AKT at the periphery of immunostained sections is due to the positioning of CXCR4+TNBC cells at the periphery of the co-culture spheroids. Fibroblasts were mainly distributed in the center of the sections and showed minimal staining, clear from the composite image in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Movie 1. Therefore, quantification was only performed on the CXCR4+TNBC cells of stained sections.Cryosections of co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (green) with HMF and CAFs immunostained for (A\u2013B) ERK and (D\u2013E) AKT. A blue fluorescent secondary antibody was used to detect ERK and AKT. Images represent spheroids on day 4 of culture. Quantification showed higher (C) ERK and (F) AKT phosphorylation in the CXCR4+TNBC cells when co-cultured with CAFs. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Drug sensitivity of stromal-cancer cells co-culture spheroidsBiochemical interactions of activated stromal cells and cancer cells are suggested as a major cause of drug resistance. To demonstrate the effect of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on drug response of breast cancer cells, we evaluated the sensitivity of co-culture spheroids to a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, to which TNBC patients may develop resistance. Cancer cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids were significantly more resistant to paclitaxel at a 0.1\u201310 nM concentration range than cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids (p < 0.01). The largest difference in cancer cell viability (36%) occurred at a drug concentration of 1 nM (Figure 8). This demonstrates the impact of activated tumor stromal cells on chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells, consistent with several other reports, and that our 3D tumor models recapitulate stromal-mediated drug resistance. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 eliminated resistance to paclitaxel of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model. This result emphasizes the potential to improve response to chemotherapy by targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling.CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids (blue bars) display resistance to paclitaxel treatment but lose resistance to the drug when co-treated with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 (gray bars), similar to the negative control counterpart (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). Images reflect spheroids at the end of drug treatment period (6 days). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.01.To understand the mechanism of paclitaxel resistance, we performed IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids to assess ERK and AKT activity in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF models treated with 1 nM paclitaxel. Following treatment, significantly higher phosphorylation levels of both proteins were maintained in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (p < 0.05), indicating that resistance to paclitaxel due to the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling is mediated by activation of these kinase pathways (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 3). Previous studies showed that paclitaxel resistance strongly correlated with increased activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in breast cancers, supporting our data. Upon co-treatment of spheroids with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100, phosphorylated levels of ERK and AKT in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model treated with paclitaxel normalized to that of control CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. These results collectively demonstrate the promising therapeutic approach of sensitizing TNBC tumors to chemotherapy treatment by disrupting the cancer-stroma signaling and its downstream pathways to overcome stroma-induced cancer cell growth and chemotherapy resistance.Immunohistochemical analysis of drug-treated spheroids indicates that increases in AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels in CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids contribute to paclitaxel resistance (blue bars). Co-treatment with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, lowers AKT and ERK activities (gray bars) to that observed in the paclitaxel sensitive control culture (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). *p < 0.05.Our findings suggest that greater proliferation and drug resistance of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model is due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling through AKT and ERK. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of these kinase pathways may block enhanced growth of cancer cells and compromise their viability. We treated both co-culture spheroids with specific inhibitors of MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and PI3K/AKT (PI-103) at a wide concentration range for a six-day period. Effectiveness of the inhibitors was assessed by eGFP detection of breast cancer cells in treated groups relative to their respective negative control group (no treatment) and presented as percent cell viability. We found that breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model were more sensitive to PD0325901 treatment below 100 nM (Figure 10A) and PI-103 treatment below 1 \u00b5M (Figure 10B). We further confirmed the reduction in breast cancer cell viability using quantification of fluorescence images of drug-treated spheroids in Figure 10C\u201310D. The largest differences in the viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs and HMF were 23% and 27% at 1 nM of PD0325901 and 0.1 nM of PI-103, respectively. Interestingly, PI-103 at a 0.1 nM concentration reduced breast cancer cell viability in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to 56%. This was consistent with protein expression results that showed significant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 6 and 7) leads to increased growth of the breast cancer cells (Figure 4). This also agrees with a study that showed CXCL12 signaling-mediated drug resistant cancer cells became substantially more sensitive to chemotherapy through AKT inhibition. At higher concentrations, the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor is more effective and reduces the cancer cells viability to less than 10%. Overall, the results corroborate our protein expression study that showed upregulated activity of these two kinase pathways due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling. Although CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 can potentially activate multiple pathways in cancer cells, these results establish signaling to MAPK and PI3K pathways in TNBC cells and the promising result of targeting these pathways to improve cytotoxicity. Considering the activation of both kinase pathways due to this signaling, their simultaneous inhibition using combination treatments with specific molecular inhibitors of AKT and MAPK pathways may result in synergistic inhibition of TNBC cell growth and survival at lower drug concentrations than those with single-agent treatments. Collectively, these results strongly support the utility of our 3D tumor models for cellular and molecular studies of tumor-stromal interactions.Viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with HMF and CAFs treated with a MEK inhibitor, (A) PD0325901, and a PI3K inhibitor, (B) PI-103, measured using the endogenous eGFP signal of the TNBC cells. CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs show greater drug sensitivity to the molecular inhibitors. Images reflect spheroids at end of drug treatment period (5 days). Error bars represent standard error of mean. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.In conclusion, our robotic technology allowed facile generation of co-culture spheroids to conveniently study stromal-cancer (TNBC) cells interactions. We found that CXCL12 from CAFs signaled through CXCR4 on triple negative cancer cells to significantly enhance TNBC cell proliferation. Additionally, CAFs showed greater proliferation than their normal HMF counterpart. Increased proliferation of TNBC cells occurred due to activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, two known effectors of CXCR4 signaling. CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling also conferred resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrated the potential to overcome stromal-mediated drug resistance using small molecule inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways and CXCR4 signaling. Altogether, these findings highlight the power of our model system to identify promising new therapeutic strategies to improve response to therapy in TNBC. Future studies with improved tumor models should address and distinguish effects of stromal cells-deposited ECM signaling and stromal cells-mediated biochemical signaling with cancer cells on the proliferation and drug response of cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) preparationTwo polymers, BioUltra polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma), MW: 35 kDa, and dextran (DEX) (Pharmacosmos), MW: 500 kDa, were utilized to form an aqueous two-phase system, as described previously. Briefly, PEG and DEX were added to the complete cell culture medium at 5.0% (w/v) and 12.8% (w/v), respectively. The polymers were dissolved using a vortex mixer and then incubating in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The polymer solutions were then stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Prior to use, the PEG phase polymer solution was filtered by passing it through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter to remove any impurities.Cell cultureThree different triple negative breast cancer cells were utilized for experiments. The cell lines were: MDA-MB-231 (labeled TNBC), MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR4 receptor (labeled CXCR4+TNBC), and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR7 receptor (labeled CXCR7+TNBC). These cells were previously stably transduced using lentiviral vectors and the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cancer cells was confirmed through flow cytometry. The TNBC cells were additionally stably transduced to express eGFP for detection. In addition, a human mammary fibroblast (HMF) cell line (labeled HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein was utilized. HMF cells were also stably transduced to secrete 0.75 ng/ml/hr of CXCL12-\u03b1 fused with mCherry for tracking, and the resulting cells were labeled as CAFs. CAFs extracted from breast cancer patients secreted varying amounts of CXCL12 in media ranging from 0.9 ng/ml \u2013 2 ng/ml over a 48 hr time period, depending on the patients and the tumor samples. The higher CXCL12 secretion rate of our transduced HMFs accounts for medium renewals and drug additions that consequently dilute the CXCL12 concentration in the medium. To maintain the cells in culture, they were grown in T175 flasks at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 using Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). Once a confluent monolayer formed, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and dissociated using 5 ml trypsin (Life Technologies) in an incubator for \u223c2 min. The cells were then neutralized with 10 ml of the complete growth medium, collected, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, cells were resupsended in 1 ml of fresh medium, and loaded into a hemocytometer for counting.Co-culture spheroid formation using aqueous two-phase system (ATPS)A ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells was used to form co-culture spheroids that model the high stromal content often observed in larger and more advanced human breast tumors. Our initial tests with 1:3 and 1:4 ratios (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial TNBC cell density constant did not make any further changes in the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the selected ratio of 1:2 (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) was used for all the studies. To prepare for forming spheroids, 30 \u03bcl of the PEG phase solution was dispensed into each well of a 384-well plate, labeled as the destination plate. The DEX phase solution was mixed at an equal volume with a specific density of cells (1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monoculture spheroids of TNBC cells, 2 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monocultures spheroids of HMF and CAFs, and 3 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF and TNBC-CAFs). The DEX phase solution and the cell suspension became diluted in half upon mixing resulting in a final polymer concentration of 6.4% (w/v), and densities of 5 \u00d7 103/0.3 \u03bcl TNBC cells in monoculture spheroids, 1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl HMF cells or CAFs in monoculture spheroids, and 1.5 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl in co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF cells or TNBC-CAFs. A source 384-well plate was prepared by loading the wells from a single column with \u223c20 \u03bcl of the solution of mixed DEX phase and cell suspension. A robotic liquid handler (Bravo SRT, Agilent) was programmed to mix the source plate content and aspirate 0.3 \u03bcl from each well. This solution was robotically dispensed as a single drop into each well of the destination plate containing the PEG phase. This process was repeated for all columns of the destination plate. After completion, the destination plate was placed in an incubator to allow cells to aggregate into a single spheroid in each well within 48 hrs. Our studies used a total of eight co-culture models: TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC: HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. Images of co-culture spheroids were captured using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) equipped with a high-resolution camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss).Robotic media exchange of co-culture spheroidsAfter forming spheroids, the cell culture medium in microwells was robotically exchanged to fresh medium containing only \u223c1% FBS. This was to ensure minimizing the effect of serum on cell growth and capture the effect of paracrine stromal-cancer cells signaling. The medium exchange was performed by three consecutive robotic dispensing and aspirating of 40 \u03bcl of the medium containing 1% FBS. This reduced the FBS concentration in the microwells from that of the complete growth medium to a very low level of \u223c1%. Therefore, the co-culture spheroids were maintained in \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of experiments. The medium exchange also diluted the PEG and DEX polymer concentrations and resulted in a single medium phase. The ATPS was not necessary at this point as it was only used for spheroid formation. The liquid handling protocol was optimized to avoid loss of spheroids during the process of medium exchange. Following this step, spheroids remained in 70 \u03bcl of homogenous \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of culture and without any further medium exchange.Evaluation of metabolic activity of co-culture spheroidsThe growth of co-culture spheroids was evaluated for a six-day period for all eight co-culture models using a standard PrestoBlue metabolic activity assay (Invitrogen). The PrestoBlue reagent contains a resazurin compound that is reduced by metabolically active, viable cells to resorufin detectable with standard plate readers at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. We have previously optimized the PrestoBlue assay for use with spheroid cultures. The resulting raw fluorescence data from all eight co-culture spheroids were normalized to the highest fluorescent readout obtained in the experimental data over the six-day period. Data from replicates (n = 14) of each co-culture model were then averaged and statistically evaluated to select certain co-culture models for further studies.Statistical analysis of growth of co-culture spheroidsStatistical analysis was performed on the metabolic activity of co-culture models using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Briefly, the data represented measured signals from eight different co-culture models over six days. For each model on each day, there were 14 experimental replicates that were repeatedly used over the six-day measurement period. Therefore, we selected one-way MANOVA for data analysis to account for the temporal dependency of the daily measurements with each spheroid from a given co-culture model. The data were tested in two steps: (i) to evaluate if a co-culture model was statistically different from the other models. This was done by testing the null hypothesis that none of the co-cultures was different from the other models; and (ii) to identify if the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was statistically different from the other seven models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs). This was done using seven pairwise comparisons to test the null hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model was not different from the other models.The first statistical test showed significant differences among the eight co-culture models. Next, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was selected for pairwise comparisons with the other seven models due to its higher levels of proliferation. We determined if greater proliferation in this model was statistically significant from the other co-cultures. The Bonferroni correction was utilized to control the family-wise error since this was a multiple testing problem. A significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 was selected to determine significant differences between the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and every other co-culture model. But \u03b1 was first modified to \u03b1/m, where m accounts for the number of hypotheses made. In this analysis, the number of hypotheses was m = 7. Therefore, a corrected significance level of 0.007 was used to reject the hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was not different from all the other seven co-cultures.For experiments that contained only two or three co-culture models presented in other sections, a student\u2019s t-test in Microsoft Excel Software or two-way ANOVA in Minitab Software was utilized with a p < 0.05 representing statistical significance.Blocking and stimulating chemokine-receptor signaling in co-culture spheroidsTo further evaluate cell proliferation due to chemokine-receptor signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids, AMD3100 (Selleckchem) was used to block the signaling and CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium was used to stimulate the signaling. A stock solution of AMD3100 was prepared in distilled, sterile water at 5 mM and stored at \u201380\u00b0C according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The desired concentration of AMD3100 was prepared by serially diluting the stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After formation of spheroids in the PEG-DEX ATPS, the medium exchange was done by adding 40 \u03bcl of AMD3100 at a 1.75 \u03bcM concentration to wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of medium. This diluted AMD3100 concentration to 1 \u03bcM. The AMD3100 solution was renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh solution of AMD3100 at a 1 \u03bcM concentration.To induce signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids, the spheroids were treated with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium collected from a confluent monolayer of CAFs. The conditioned medium was extracted from the CAFs monolayer 24 hours after seeding to ensure that it contained high levels of nutrients and growth factors. The conditioned medium was added to co-culture spheroids through medium exchange and renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh conditioned medium. Metabolic activity of co-culture spheroids following inhibition (AMD3100 treatment) or stimulation (CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium treatment) was evaluated daily using PrestoBlue over the six-day culture period. Data were compared to the respective negative controls, i.e., co-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF for inhibition and CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs for stimulation) that were grown in 70 \u03bcl of 1% FBS-containing media without receiving any treatment. Daily measured raw data from the co-culture models over the six-day culture were normalized to the highest fluorescent value obtained and then used for statistical tests.TNBC cell growth in co-culture spheroidsThe growth of TNBC cells in the co-culture models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs) that were selected based on the metabolic activity analysis was further confirmed by measuring the endogenous eGFP in TNBC cells using a plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The results were compared to those of the monoculture spheroids (TNBC and CXCR4+TNBC). Each model had n = 14 replicates. Data from each model were normalized to an arbitrary fluorescent value of 8000 a.u. for ease of comparison among different groups. Background fluorescence from the mCherry-expressing stromal cells in the co-culture spheroids was subtracted from the measured signal of TNBC cells. Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (Fluoview, FV1000, Olympus).Immunostaining and quantification of proliferation of co-culture spheroidsTo validate and quantify cell proliferation of co-culture spheroids, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an established protocol. Co-culture spheroids were aspirated from microwells on day four and collected in 200 \u03bcl microcentrifuge tubes. Medium used for transferring spheroids was carefully removed from the microcentrifuge tubes and 100 \u03bcl of 4% formaldehyde was added to fix the spheroids for 10 minutes at room temperature. The spheroids were rinsed with 100 \u03bcl of PBS three times for 5 minutes to remove the formaldehyde. A 30% (w/v) sucrose solution was then added to remove water from spheroids and prevent crystal formation upon freezing. Once spheroids sank to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes, an equal volume (100 \u03bcl) of tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences) was added to each tube. Samples were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight. Frozen samples were prepared the following day by flash-freezing spheroids into biopsy-sized cryomolds with dry ice. The spheroids were embedded between two thin layers of tissue freezing medium while avoiding bubble formation. The frozen molds containing the spheroids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.A cryostat (Leica CM 1850) was used to cryosection the spheroids to 10 \u03bcm-thick slices. Only the middle sections of spheroids were collected and assessed. Each slice was transferred onto Superfrost Plus microscopic slides (Fisher). The sections were stained using a standard immunostaining protocol with primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling including the proliferative cell marker Ki-67, phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan). A blue fluorescent secondary antibody (AMCA-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for detection to avoid interfering with the endogenous mCherry and eGFP signals in the stromal and TNBC cells, respectively. The endogenous eGFP fluorescence of TNBC cells was used to distinguish TNBC and stromal cells. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) was used to capture fluorescent images. Image processing and analysis were performed in ImageJ Software (NIH) to quantify expression of each blue-labeled protein. The TNBC cells of sections were found through binary conversion of the green channel images to select and outline only the eGFP-expressing TNBC cells. This TNBC cell outline was then overlaid on the blue channel images to measure the mean gray value of protein-expressing TNBC cells. For Ki-67 analysis, this value was then subtracted from the total mean gray value of blue channel images to determine the mean gray value of Ki-67+ stromal cells.Western blot analysis with spheroidsCo-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF) were harvested from microplates on day four and transferred into 50 mL conical tubes. After centrifuging down the samples, the supernatant was removed and spheroids were washed with PBS. Spheroids were lysed using 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer (50 mM tric-HCL, 150 mM NaCl 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4 \u00b1 0.2), a protease inhibitor (complete mini, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). Spheroids were sonicated (Vibra-Cell, Sonics) twice for five seconds at a 50% amplitude level to ensure complete lysis. A BCA quantification assay kit (Life Technologies) was then used to quantify the total protein concentration extracted from spheroids. Electrophoresis and electroblotting were performed by protein addition (20 \u03bcl) onto a 4\u201315% gel (Biorad) and then gel transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling for phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan) were prepared at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, and incubated with membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. The membranes were thoroughly washed prior to and following secondary antibody treatment and detected with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) using a FluorChem E imaging system (ProteinSimple). Quantified protein expression data were normalized to their corresponding \u03b2-actin expression.Chemotherapy drug testing with co-culture spheroidsBoth CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids were subjected to (i) single treatment with a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel (Selleckchem), and (ii) co-treatment with paclitaxel and AMD3100, to evaluate drug responses of TNBC cells. A stock solution of paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a 23 mM concentration and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. For single drug treatment, paclitaxel drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 2X the desired concentration. The drug solutions were added to co-culture spheroids, resulting in a total media volume of 70 \u03bcl and diluting the drug concentration in half. For co-treatment of spheroids with paclitaxel and AMD3100, drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 3.5X the desired concentration and directly added (20 \u03bcl of each drug solution) to co-culture spheroids in wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of media. Paclitaxel was added at a wide range of concentrations (0.01 \u2013 1000 nM) while AMD3100 was used at a constant 1 \u03bcM concentration for co-treatments. Single-agent (paclitaxel) and co-treatment (paclitaxel and AMD3100) tests were conducted for six days. A small volume (5 \u03bcl) of concentrated AMD3100 (15 \u03bcM) was directly added to the co-treated spheroid cultures after 72 hrs of incubation to provide a fresh dose of 1 \u03bcM AMD3100. Each condition in drug treatment studies used 14 spheroids. After six days, the TNBC cell viability of drug treated co-culture spheroids was evaluated using their endogenous eGFP fluorescence. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to the respective negative control conditions (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability.Preparation of inhibitors and testing against co-culture spheroidsThe CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and CXCR4+TNBC: CAFs spheroids were treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (Selleckchem), and a PI3K inhibitor, PI-103 (Selleckchem). Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared at a 50 mM concentration in DMSO and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. The desired inhibitor concentrations for experiments were prepared by serially diluting each stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After forming co-culture spheroids, the medium exchange was performed as previously described and 30 \u03bcl of an inhibitor solution (prepared at 2X desired concentration) was added to spheroids in the last renewal stage, diluting the inhibitor concentrations in half. A column of spheroids was left untreated and only received 30 \u03bcl of fresh 1% FBS-containing medium. Spheroids were incubated for 72 hrs and then treatments were renewed by direct addition of 30 \u03bcl of fresh inhibitor solutions (prepared at 1X desired concentration). The negative control conditions received 1% FBS-containing medium. The spheroids were incubated for an additional 48 hrs and viable TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids were detected using their endogenous eGFP with a plate reader. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to their respective negative controls (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability. The results obtained from plate reading were further confirmed by fluorescent microscopy (Axio Observer, Zeiss) followed by image analysis (ImageJ, NIH).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND

Breast carcinomas are composed of tumor cells and different types of non-carcinogenic cells that constitute tumor stroma. It became clear that the carcinoma-stroma interplay is critical for carcinogenesis through intercellular cross-talk. Fibroblasts, the most common and the most active type of stromal cells, are known as reactive fibroblasts, myofibroblasts or cancer-associated fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts have a prominent role in the growth, progression and spread of tumor cells through active release of various growth factors, cytokines and chemokines such as TGF-\u03b21, SDF-1 and IL-6. The active status of myofibroblasts is sustained even in absence of the activating signal, due mainly to the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop that links inflammation to cancer. One of the important members of this loop is the Let-7b, which belongs to the let-7 family of microRNAs. Members of this family are highly conserved in sequence and function from C. elegans to humans, and play important roles in several physiological and pathological processes such as development, differentiation as well as carcinogenesis. Functionally, let-7 family members act as tumor suppressor in several types of malignant human tumors by inhibiting the expression of oncogenes and key regulators of mitogenic pathways. Indeed, the expression of let-7 family members has been found reduced in many types of cancers. Furthermore, it has been shown that the restoration of let-7b expression effectively inhibited the growth of lung and breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as in mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, it has been recently reported that let-7b expression was reduced in breast cancer tissues and was inversely associated with tumor lymph node metastasis, patient overall survival and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, breast cancer patients with low let-7b expression had poor prognoses, indicating that let-7b could act as tumor suppressor miRNA in breast cancer onset and spread.In the present report, we have shown that let-7b suppresses the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts through negative regulation of IL-8.RESULTSBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts express low level of let-7b, and specific inhibition of let-7b activates breast stromal fibroblastsTo investigate the importance of let-7b in breast stromal fibroblasts (BSF) activation and the carcinoma-stroma functional interplay, we first assessed the level of this microRNA in 13 CAFs and their corresponding tumor counterpart fibroblasts (TCFs) derived from the same patients and cultured simultaneously. Total RNA was purified from these cells and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to amplify/quantify the let-7b microRNA. Figure 1A shows let-7b down-regulation in all CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, with great difference between the different pairs. This prompted us to test the possible implication of let-7b down-regulation in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, normal breast stromal fibroblasts (TCF-346) were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control sequence (TCF-346c) for 24 h, and then the levels of let-7b and its downstream targets were assessed by qRT-PCR. Figure 1B shows that let-7b level was significantly reduced, with concomitant strong up-regulation of IL-6 (12 fold) in TCF-346i as compared to control cells. Similarly, let-7b inhibition increased the levels of miR-21 and RELA that codes for NF-\u03baB (p65), while it reduced the level of PTEN as compared to the control cells (Figure 1B). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activated the IL-6-related positive feedback loop. To confirm this observation, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the expression of Lin28B and the activation of STAT3 and AKT, three major components of the loop. To this end, cell lysates were prepared from TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, and proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis. We first confirmed that let-7b inhibition increased the expression of IL-6 at the protein level as well (Figure 1C). Subsequently, we have shown that let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT), and up-regulated Lin28B, an inhibitor of let-7b (Figure 1C). This indicates that the inhibition of let-7b function activated the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop in BSFs. Thereby, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the activation of BSFs by assessing the levels of the three major markers of active fibroblasts (ACTA2 (\u03b1-SMA), SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21). Interestingly, let-7b inhibitor increased the mRNA levels of these three genes as compared to the negative control (Figure 1D). On the other hand, the level of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A was decreased in TCF-346i as compared to controls (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained when TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells were passaged once and were reincubated in let-7b inhibitor-free medium (Supplementary Figure 1). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts.Let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts through the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated 13 CAF/TCF pairs (T64 to T900), and the level of let-7b was assessed by qRT-PCR. The values obtained in CAFs were divided by the values of their corresponding TCFs, and then were plotted. (B and D) TCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then medium was replaced with inhibitor-free medium for 24 h. Total RNA was purified and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells, and were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms.Let-7b inhibition stably activates breast stromal fibroblastsWe then asked whether let-7b inhibition-dependent activation of the loop and BSFs is permanent or transient. Therefore, the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 48 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibition-free medium (IFM) 4 times. Figure 2A shows that let-7b remained down-regulated while the levels of miR-21, IL-6, RELA and Lin28B remained up-regulated in TCF-346i relative to controls, despite the removal of the let-7b inhibitor and cells were passaged several times. These findings were confirmed in other cells (TCF-64) (Supplementary Figure 2A), and at the protein level for IL-6 and Lin28B (Figure 2B). Furthermore, let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the transient let-7b inhibition activates the positive feedback loop in a persistent manner. Therefore, we also confirmed the persistent activation of BSFs upon let-7b inhibition by showing sustained up-regulation of the \u03b1-SMA protein (Figure 2B) and mRNA (Figure 2C) in TCF-346i relative to TCF-346c. Likewise, the levels of the SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2 -1 mRNAs also remained higher in TCF-346i and TCF-64i relative to their respective controls (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2B, respectively). On the other hand, the CDKN2A gene remained repressed (Figure 2C). This suggests that let-7b inhibition persistently transformed breast stromal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts likely through the activation of the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. To confirm this, we decided to investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition on the invasion/migration abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, in IFM and after many passaging, were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with serum-free medium (SFM), while lower chamber wells contained complete medium (CpM). The invasion and migration of cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 2E shows increase in the invasion/migration abilities of TCF-346i cells as compared to TCF-346c cells. Using the same system, we have also shown that the proliferation rate of TCF-346i cells was higher than control cells (Figure 2E). This indicates that let-7b inhibition persistently increased the invasion/migration and proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts, which confirms their sustained activation. This was confirmed at the molecular level by showing the persistent activation of ERK1/2 and the up-regulation of MMP9 in TCF-346i cells as compared to controls (Figure 2F).Let-7b inhibition persistently activates STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and enhances the invasion/migration/proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblastsTCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 24 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibitor-free medium 4 times. (A and C) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (B and F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms. (D and E) Exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells (104) in let-7b inhibitor-free medium were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates (invasion/migration), while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium. Cell invasion, migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Let-7b inhibition in breast fibroblasts triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in an IL-8-dependent paracrine fashionTo further show the permanent active status of TCF-346i cells, we sought to test their paracrine effects. To perform this, serum-free medium (SFM) was conditioned with TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells for 24 h, and then the resulting serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) (TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM, respectively) were first used to assess the effect of let-7b knock-down on the secretion of various cytokines using the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody arrays. Great differential levels of various cytokines were observed between TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, including, GRO, IL-6, IL-8 and IGFBP2 (Figure 3A, 3B). These results were confirmed by ELISA for the most prominent protein IL-8. Indeed, the secreted level of this pro-carcinogenic cytokine was significantly increased in TCF-346i cells compared to controls (Figure 3B).Let-7b inhibition triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in a paracrine manner(A) TCF-346i and TCF-346c cells were incubated for 24 h in SFM and the resulting SFCM (TCF-346i-SFCM and TCF-346c-SFCM, respectively) were applied to cytokine array membranes.

(D and E) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of the indicated SFCM. The migration/invasion and proliferation abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. (F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (G) MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM media containing either IgG (TCF-346i-SFCM + IgG) or neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) (TCF-346i-SFCM + \u03b1IL-8), and then whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (H) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM, and migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.To test the paracrine effects of TCF-346i cells on breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with SFM, while the lower chamber wells contained TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM. The migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 3C shows increase in the migration and invasion capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM as compared to those treated with TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, TCF-346i-SFCM enhanced the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to controls (Figure 3D).In addition, we tested the effect of TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunoblotting. Figure 3E shows that TCF-346i-SFCM down-regulated both epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam, while it increased the level of the mesenchymal markers ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail relative to cells exposed to TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, the stemness marker ALDH was also up-regulated (Figure 3E). This shows that TCF-346i cells enhanced the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 cells in a paracrine manner, which further confirms the active status of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts.Since let-7b inhibition strongly increased the expression/secretion of IL-8, we hypothesized the possible implication of this cytokine in the paracrine pro-EMT effects of TCF-346i cells. To verify this, we neutralized IL-8 in TCF-346i-SFCM using specific antibody, while IgG was utilized as control, and then MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as described above. Figure 3F shows that neutralizing IL-8 inhibited the pro-EMT process of TCF-346i-SFCM relative to cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG. Similarly, adding the neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody to TCF-346i-SFCM inhibited its pro-migratory and -invasive effects as compared to cells exposed to TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG, reaching a level similar to that obtained with TCF-346c-SFCM (Figure 3G). This indicates that the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of let-7b-deficient BSF are IL-8-related.Let-7b deficient fibroblasts stimulate breast cancer orthotopic tumor growth in miceTo investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition in human breast fibroblasts on tumor growth in vivo, orthotopic breast tumor xenografts were created under the nipples the 4th left fat pad of nude mice by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2x106) with either TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2x106), which were passaged 4 times post-transfection. Tumors bearing TCF-346i fibroblasts (T-TCF346i) appeared earlier and grew much faster relative to those having control cells (T-TCF346c) (Figure 4A). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs can enhance orthotopic tumor growth in mice. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed more necrosis in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4B). This shows that let-7b-deficient BSFs enhance tumor aggressiveness.Let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhance orthotopic tumor growthOrthotopic breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with TCF-346c or TCF-346i cells under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of nude mice. (A) The histogram shows the volumes of xenograft tumors that were measured at the indicated time points. (B) Tissues were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining (Envision 40x). (C) Orthotopic tumors bearing TCF-346c cells (T-TCF-346c) or TCF-346i cells (T-TCF-346i) were excised and whole cell lysates were prepared and protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (D) Excised tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry against the indicated proteins.Additionally, whole cell extracts were prepared from T-TCF346i and T-TCF346i tissues, and the levels of various cancer- and metastasis-promoting genes were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure 4C shows that T-TCF346i tumors express higher level of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twsit1 and vimentin, while E-cadherin and EpCAM levels were lower as compared to T-TCF346c tumors. This confirms the in vitro results showing the enhancement of the EMT process by let-7b-deficient fibroblasts. In addition, TCF346i cells increased the level of the stemness markers CD44 and ALDH and the pluripotency markers KLF4 and SOX-2 relative to TCF346c cells (Figure 4C). Figure 4C also shows strong increase in the expression levels of the downstream proliferation effectors cyclin D1 and C-Myc in T-TCF346i tumors relative to controls. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing higher Ki-67 staining in T-TCF346i tissue relative to controls (Figure 4D). This shows that the presence of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhanced the growth as well as the EMT/stemness processes in breast cancer cells in orthotopic xenografts. In addition, let-7b-deficient BSFs enhanced the formation of new blood vessels in orthotopic tumors as shown by the strong increase in the staining of the endothelial cells marker CD34 in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4D). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs promote angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. This could result from increase in the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. Indeed, the levels of IL-8, HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream target VEGF-A were higher in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c, which explains the strong increase in the neo-vascularization shown in the tumors bearing TCF346i fibroblasts (Figure 4C, 4D).Let-7b mimic stably inhibits the STAT3/NF- \u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop and represses active breast fibroblastsTo further confirm the role of let-7b in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of increased level of let-7b on active BSFs. Therefore, CAF-346 and CAF-64 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m and CAF-64m, respectively) or a control sequence (CAF-346c and CAF-64c, respectively) for 24 h, and then total RNA was purified and the level of the let-7b microRNA was assessed. Figures 5A and Supplementary Figure 3A show highly significant increase in the level of let-7b in CAF-346m and CAF-64m as compared to their respective controls. Expectedly, the mRNA level of the let-7b downstream target IL-6 was significantly decreased in CAF-346m relative to controls (Figure 5A). Similar effect was observed for miR-21, RELA and lin28B, whilst PTEN was up-regulated in CAF-346m as compared to the control cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore, let-7b mimic reduced the protein levels of IL-6, Lin28B, active STAT3 (p-STAT3) as well as active AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 5B). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inhibited the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. Concomitantly, the increase in the level of let-7b decreased the mRNA levels of the 3 main myofibroblast markers (ACTA2, SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21), while up-regulated CDKN2A in CAF-346m as compared to control cells (Figure 5C). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inactivated myofibroblats through inhibiting the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop. Indeed, let-7b mimic transformed the shape of cells from large and flat (characteristic of myofibroblasts) to rounded spindle-shaped, which characterize normal fibroblasts (Figure 6A). To test the persistent effect of let-7b mimic, cells were passaged several times, and then the expression of different relevant genes was assessed. Importantly, let-7b level was reduced in both CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S relative to their respective control cells (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). On the other hand, IL-6, miR-21, RELA and lin28B remained down-regulated while PTEN remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). At the protein levels, the IL-6 and Lin28B levels remained reduced, while STAT3 and AKT remained inactive (Figure 6C). Moreover, the level of \u03b1-SMA remained reduced at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower levels of SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2-1 were also sustained, while the CDKN2A mRNA levels remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S as compared to their respective control cells (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 3C). This was confirmed by showing reduced migratory, invasive and proliferative capacities of CAF-346m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6E and 6F). These cellular results were corroborated with decrease in the levels of p-ERK1/2 and MMP-9 in CAF-346m-S as compared to CAF-346c-S cells (Figure 6G). These results indicate that ectopic increase in let-7b level stably reverted myofibroblasts to inactive fibroblasts through inactivation of the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b feedback loop.Increase in the level of let-7b inactivates the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and suppresses myofibroblastsCAF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m) or a control sequence (CAF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b mimic was removed and replaced with let-7b mimic-free medium for 24 h.

(E) Exponentially growing cells (104) were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates, while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. (F) cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium, and cell proliferation was assessed for 72 h. Cell invasion/migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Furthermore, ELISA indicates significant decrease in the secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF-A from CAF-346m-S relative to controls (Figure 7A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effect of CAF-346m-S cells and their corresponding controls on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. To perform this, SFM were conditioned with CAF-346c-S and CAF-346m-S cells for 24 h, and then the resulting SFCM were added to MDA-MB-231 cells. Figure 7B shows decrease in the invasive/migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CAF-346m-S.SFCM as compared to those treated with CAF-346c-SFCM. Furthermore, CAF-346m-S.SFCM up-regulated the epithelial makers (E-cadherin and EpCAM), whilst it reduced the levels of the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail) (Figure 7C). This suggests that CAF-346m-S.SFCM inhibits the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Likewise, CAF-346m-S.SFCM reduced the expression level of the stemness marker ALDH (Figure 7C). Together, these results indicate that let-7b mimic represses the procarcinogenic effects of active breast stromal fibroblasts.Overexpression of let-7b by mimic decreased cancer-promoting abilities of breast myofibroblasts(A) SFCM from the indicated cells were collected, and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by ELISA and were presented in the respective histograms. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 S.D. **, P<0.001 (n=3). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the presence of the indicated SFCM as described in Figure 2D, and then the migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System.

(C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH.IL-8 is under the control of let-7b and is highly expressed in CAF cellsBased on the results obtained in Figure 3, we sought to investigate the possible implication of let-7b in the control of IL-8 expression. Therefore, the IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in CAF-346m, TCF-346i and their respective control cells CAF-346c and TCF-346c. Figure 8A shows that while let-7b mimic significantly reduced the level of the IL-8 mRNA, let-7b inhibition strongly up-regulated IL-8 as compared to their respective controls. This let-7b-dependent expression of the IL-8 mRNA was also observed at the protein level (Figure 8B). This indicates that let-7b negatively controls the expression of IL-8. Thereby, we assessed the IL-8 level in various CAF/TCF pairs derived from different breast cancer patients and also normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) derived from plastic surgery. Figure 8C shows that the IL-8 expression level was higher in 8 out of 9 (89%) CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, and in all TCF cells as compared to NBFs. Indeed, IL-8 was almost undetectable in NBFs, while CAFs exhibited the highest levels (Figure 8D). This mirrors let-7b down-regulation in the majority of CAF cells compared to their TCF counterparts (Figure 1A).Let-7b negatively controls IL-8, which is highly expressed in CAF cells(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells, and IL-8 level was assessed by qRT-PCR using specific primers. Experiments were performed in triplicate and several times; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 2 independent experiments (**,P < 0.001). (B and C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (D) Box plot showing IL-8 expression levels in the indicated types of breast fibroblasts as determined in Figure 8C.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs play major roles in both the onset as well as the progression of various types of cancer, including breast carcinomas. These effects are not only autocrine, but also paracrine and through secreted exosomes. Indeed, these small non-coding RNAs are both mediators and communicators between cancer cells and their microenvironment. MicroRNAs play also important roles in modulating the biology of cancer-associated fibroblasts towards a more permissive pro-tumoral phenotype. In the present report, we have shown that the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7b is down-regulated in most breast cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to their adjacent paired TCFs; and specific let-7b inhibition granted BSFs with traits of activated fibroblasts, including enhanced migration/invasion and proliferation. Like in cancer cells, this effect was persistent through the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop, which is responsible for the persistent activation of BSFs. The activation of this loop may also provide a molecular explanation for let-7b down-regulation in CAFs. Indeed, let-7b inhibitor Lin28B, is up-regulated in response to the induction of the IL-6 feedback loop in both cancer and fibroblast cells. Previously, Zhao et al have identified several dysregulated miRNAs in breast CAFs, and miR-200 family members were severely suppressed. Subsequently, they have shown that downregulation of miR200s activated breast stromal fibroblasts. Similarly, it has been shown that miR-26b is down-regulated in CAFs from ER-positive breast cancers, and when specifically down-regulated it activated normal breast fibroblasts. This indicates that several miRNAs, like the important tumor suppressor genes p16, p53 and PTEN, also suppress breast stromal fibroblasts, may be through repressing their target onco/inflammatory genes. Several publications have reported the role of microRNAs in activating stromal fibroblasts through modulating the expression of important inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and CCL5. Likewise, we have shown here that let-7b also controls the secretion of several important cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro, Gro-\u03b1 and others (Figure 3A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effects of let-7b-deficient BSFs. Importantly, let-7b inhibition enhanced the pro-carcinogenic effects of BSFs in a paracrine manner both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. These extracellular effects of let-7b-deficient cells are IL-8-dependent. Indeed, these cells secreted high levels of IL-8, and specific inhibition of this cytokine in the corresponding SFCM suppressed the paracrine induction of the EMT process in breast cancer cells (Figure 3). In fact, let-7b represses the expression of IL-8 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Since IL-8 is not a target of let-7b and its 3\u2019UTR does not contain specific let-7b seeding site, this let-7b-dependent regulation of IL-8 expression could be indirect through the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feed back loop. It is well known that IL-8 is a target of the transcription factors STAT3 and NF-\u03baB. Similarly, the expression of IL-8 was inhibited in H.pylori infected gastric epithelial cells with let-7b overexpression and the consequent NF-\u03baB down-regulation. This shows that let-7b negatively controls 2 major imflammatory/cancer-related cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. This was confirmed by showing that most CAFs express high level of IL-8 as compared to their corresponding TCFs. Additionally, we have shown that TCFs, which were generated from histologically normal breast tissues, exhibited higher levels of IL-8 relative to those observed in normal breast fibroblasts. This confirms that TCFs have some active features as previously shown, and thereby may play important roles in local recurrence.Interestingly, inhibition of let-7b in BSF promoted breast cancer tumor growth, EMT, stemness and angiogenesis in orthotopic humanized tumors, which indicates that let-7b has non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive functions. These could be mediated through several cancer-promoting factors such as IL-6 and IL-8.These results were strengthened through overexpression of let-7b by mimic in active CAF cells wherein phenotypes of normal breast fibroblasts were restored. Indeed, CAF cells became fusiform, they expressed lower levels of \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8, they were less migratory/invasive and proliferative, with strong reduction in their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects. These data further confirmed the tumor suppressive function of let-7b. Likewise, ectopic expression of miR-200s in CAFs partially restored normal features of breast fibroblasts. Similarly, re-expression of miR-31 in CAFs inhibited their capacity to promote endometrial tumor cell migration and invasion. This conversion from active CAFs to normal fibroblasts by miRNAs was also observed in ovarian CAFs. This indicates that several miRNAs are key players in suppressing the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts through post-transcriptional gene regulation.In summary, the present findings indicate that let-7b down-regulation is an important step toward the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. On the other hand, increase in the let-7b level by mimic normalizes active breast myofibroblasts, and consequently can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of the classical anti-cancer regimen.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and used as previously described. MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC and were authenticated at ATCC before purchase by their standard short tandem repeat DNA typing methodology, and were routinely tested for the presence of the relevant markers, and were cultured following the instructions of the company.

Cell migration and invasion were assessed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, 2x104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM-plate with thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration), and a complete media was added to the lower chamber wells used as a chemo-attractant. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24 h and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as a Cell index value which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Each assay was performed in triplicate.For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2\u00d7104) were seeded in E-plate with complete medium as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell index (CI) was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by the background value to represent cell status. Each assay was performed in triplicate.Immunohistochemistry staining on FFPE tissuesImmunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was performed using anti-Ki-67 and CD34 antibodies (Abcam) at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:150, respectively, and then slides were stained using automated staining platform (Ventana). Envision + polymer (ready to use; Dako) was used as a secondary antibody. Color was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and instant hematoxylin (Shandon) was used for counterstaining.Orthotopic tumor xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH&RC institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. 10 female nude mice were randomized into 2 groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by coimplantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2 \u00d7 106) with TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper using the following formula (Length X Width X Height).Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24 h, and then media were collected and briefly centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at -80\u00b0C until needed.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test and P values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant.QuantificationsThe expression levels of the immunoblotted proteins were measured using the Image J software. Protein signal intensity of each band was determined, and then dividing the obtained value of each band by the values of the corresponding internal control allowed a correction of the loading differences.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNo competing interests are declared by any of the authors.REFERENCESGlobal cancer statistics, 2012Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblasts in cancerThe inflammatory/cancer-related IL-6/STAT3/NF-kappaB positive feedback loop includes AUF1 and maintains the active state of breast myofibroblastsAberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors and its effects on the hallmarks of cancerDisrupting the pairing between let-7 and Hmga2 enhances oncogenic transformationLet-7 and miR-200 microRNAs: guardians against pluripotency and cancer progressionThe LIN28/let-7 pathway in cancerRegression of murine lung tumors by the let-7 microRNAlet-7 regulates self renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cellsPrognostic significance of let-7b expression in breast cancer and correlation to its target gene of BSG expressionMicroRNAs in cancerBreast cancer and microRNAs: therapeutic impactMicroRNA regulation of human breast cancer stem cellsMicroRNAs as mediators and communicators between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironmentEssential role of miRNAs in orchestrating the biology of the tumor microenvironmentmicroRNA-mediated regulation of the tumor microenvironmentMicroRNA regulation in cancer-associated fibroblastsSTAT3 activation of miR-21 and miR-181b-1 via PTEN and CYLD are part of the epigenetic switch linking inflammation to cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingMiRNA expression analysis of cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts in breast cancerMiR-26b is down-regulated in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts from ER-positive breast cancers leading to enhanced cell migration and invasionRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisp16(INK4A) Represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMicroRNAs reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts in ovarian cancerEpigenetic silencing of microRNA-149 in cancer-associated fibroblasts mediates prostaglandin E2/interleukin-6 signaling in the tumor microenvironmentMechanisms underlying differential expression of interleukin-8 in breast cancer cellsLet-7b is involved in the inflammation and immune responses associated with Helicobacter pylori infection by targeting Toll-like receptor 4Breast stromal fibroblasts from histologically normal surgical margins are pro-carcinogenicThe role of miR-31 and its target gene SATB2 in cancer-associated fibroblastsBreast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their counterparts display neoplastic-specific changesThe p16INK4a tumor suppressor controls p21WAF1 induction in response to ultraviolet light"

Chemotherapy is one of the cornerstone treatments in patients with breast cancer, which overall improves breast cancer outcome by 5\u201310% in patients with node negative disease. However, its use is increasingly affected by chemotherapy resistance and lack of effective predictors. Recently, emerging evidences have suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. As the most frequent component of stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, CAFs have been assumed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of breast cancer. Moreover, Farmer et al. reported that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), suggesting that stroma activation could be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, it was shown that CAFs mediated resistance to chemotherapy by releasing collagen I. Loeffler et al. have developed a vaccine that could target CAFs and allow reversing resistance to chemotherapy.Considering the interaction between CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, it would be reasonable that chemotherapy-induced damage could have an impact on CAFs and change the expression of some relevant factors, which could participate in chemotherapy resistance. In our study, we have cultured CAFs which were derived from surgically resected primary breast cancers and compared the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy. The goal will be to find candidate markers from tumor microenvironment that associate with breast cancer chemotherapy resistance and discuss the possibility that these markers could be used as predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and feasible for targeted therapy.Materials and Methods1. Ethics StatementThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent for using the samples for research purposes was obtained from all patients prior to surgery.2. Cell Culture of CAFs and Breast Cancer Cell LineTissues for primary cultures of CAFs were collected from 10 breast cancer patients who underwent complete surgical resection of their tumors at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Only tissues in excess of those required for clinical diagnoses were harvested for this study. Harvested tissues were placed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen Corporation) for immediate transportation on ice to the laboratory. Tissues were minced into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and digested for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in prepared reagent containing collagenase type I and Hyaluronidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension was filtrated with 100 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then the pellet was resuspended in the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell counting was performed with the Beckman Coulter Cell and Particle Counter Z1. The population doubling was estimated based on the increase in cell number counted at each passage time. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the breast cancer cell line, according to the normal procedure (Sigma-Aldrich).3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Primary antibodies for immunostaining included multi-cytokeratin (CK), Vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD34, and TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) (Labvision). CAFs were seeded in chamber slides and fixed in cold acetone. After antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature in a moist chamber for 60 min. Specific signals were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with 3,3/-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as a chromogen to create brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min, and the slides were coverslipped.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM)CAFs were collected and prepared as a single cell suspension by mechanical blowing with PBS at the concentration of 1\u00d7105/ml. The expression of CD34 and CD45 (MACS) was detected using FCM (FACSC alibar; BD).5. Cell Adhesion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber (Transwell; Corning). For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere (Sanofi). Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, until confluent. Matrigel (BD) was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and then 100 \u00b5l matrigel was added to each well in new 24-well plates. Two groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and transferred to 24-well plates coated with matrigel. After incubation for 1 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of MDA-MB-231 cells that adhered to the bottom of coated wells was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.6. Invasion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. Matrigel was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and 50 \u00b5l/cm2 matrigel was added to each filter. The filters were placed in 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each upper chamber, and CAFs were added to the lower chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.7. Proliferation Assay (MTT)The harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were treated with 0 ng/ml, 4 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml Taxotere, respectively. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. Assays were initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l MTT (2 mg/ml) to each well and incubating the cells for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 1 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. Finally, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate, which were read at a wavelength of 550 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum.8. mRNA Expression ProfilingTotally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). Total RNA was extracted from all cultured CAFs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Microarray studies were performed by Capital Medical University Microarray Centre, using Illumina humanHT-12 v4 expression BeadChip based on Illumina BeadStation500. The biotinylated cRNA preparation, hybridization, and scanning of microarrays were done according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Biological replicates have been used to reduce errors. Illumina Gene Expression Beaderchips have internal control features to monitor data quality. The GenomeStudio software (Ilumina) calculates and reports a detection p-value, which determines whether a transcript on the array is called detected. In our study, a detection p-value below the threshold of 0.01 indicated that a gene could be considered as expressed. Differentially expressed genes in CAFs before chemotherapy vs. after chemotherapy were also identified and analyzed with GenomeStudio. The output was filtered to include genes whose expression was altered at least two-fold. The dataset of the microarray analysis has been deposited in ArrayExpress, with the accession number E-MTAB-1614.9. Real-Time PCRReal-Time PCR was performed to confirm differential gene expression in cultured CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h), using BIO-RAD IQ5 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u00b5g total RNA, oligo (dT), and Superscript\u2122 III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesis was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the primers were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for thecandidate genes. Predicted PCR product sequences were verified by using BLAST for recognition of target and non-target sequences.10. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). Student\u2019s t test was used to test for statistical significance. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1standard error. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.Results1. Characterization of Primary-cultured CAFsBy using a study protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board, CAFs were cultured from 10 surgically resected primary breast cancers which were histologically confirmed. The cultured cells were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. The morphological and immunohistochemical pictures of CAFs were represented in Figure 1A. Additionally, FCM showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs (Figure 1B).Characterization of primary-cultured CAFs.A showed the cultured cells which were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. B showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs with FCM.2. CAFs Promotes the Function of Breast Cancer Cells after ChemotherapyWe assumed that chemotherapy-induced damage interacted with tumor microenvironment and hence compared the function of MDA-MB-231 cells after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere) co-cultured with CAFs and that without CAFs. By using cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. The representative pictures of cell functional studies were shown in Figure 2.The function comparison of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, when treated with Taxotere.By using cell adhesion assay (A), invasion assay (B), and MTT assay (C), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with cells without co-culture.3. Comparison of Gene Expression Profiling in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyTotally 24314 expressed genes were detected in the microarray assay and 35 differentially expressed genes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between CAFs after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were summarized in Table S1 and Figure 3A with clustering analysis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed genes were also annotated in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion (hsa04510), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010).Hierarchical clustering of gene analysis expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere).A showed the Heatmap plot of scaled gene-expression levels. The first 6 columns marked with \u201c1\u201d on top have represented the samples untreated with Taxotere, while the following 6 columns marked with \u201c2\u201d have represented the samples treated with Taxotere. Rows are genes with mean fold change between CAFs before and after chemotherapy. B and C revealed that these genes including up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity through GO analysis.4. Differential Expression of Candidate Genes in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyWe have picked up 6 genes from 35 differential genes and confirmed the different gene expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) via Real-Time PCR, using triplicate samples. The candidate genes included up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The pictures were represented in Figure 4.Differential expression of candidate genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy.The candidate genes were picked up from 35 differential genes, including up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. The differential expression of 6 genes in three pairs of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05).DiscussionAs is known, cancer is a systemic disease encompassing multiple components of both tumor cells themselves and tumor microenvironment. The notion is now widely accepted that the development and progression of cancer highly depends on the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Recently, many investigations have pointed to stromal cells as the major regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancers. However, the origin of CAFs has been a debate. Based on different theories, CAFs might arise from activated resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or other undetermined mechanisms. Correspondingly, CAFs were reported to exhibit different expression of multiple biomarkers such \u03b1-SMA, FSP-1, FAP, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b2), vimentin, CAV-1, PTEN, p21, or TP53 mutation. According to our study, CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) and negative expression of CK, CD34, as well as CD45, suggesting that these primary-cultured CAFs were more likely to arise from activated resident fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cells, endothelial cells or bone marrow. We are aware that the observation based on morphological characteristics is just weak evidence for explaining the origin hypothesis, which needs further and more fundamental studies. Moreover, our data showed that CAFs could promote the adhesion, invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, which was consistent with peer researches.Breast cancer is known as the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been considered as an effective way which could improve the outcomes especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. However, the resistance of tumor cells to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs and lack of useful predictive markers of response to NAC continue to be problems. Though the precise nature and molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still unclear, many current studies have focused on identifying novel predictors of chemotherapy efficiency. CAFs merit attention, in consideration of frequent association with chemotherapy resistance. Sonnenberg et al. reported highly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in CAFs from lung and breast, which could explain some levels of resistance in stroma-positive tumors where stroma would not be sensitive to chemotherapy. Furthermore, an oral DNA vaccine targeting fibroblasts activation protein (FAP) was developed to suppress primary tumor cell growth and metastasis of multidrug-resistant murine breast carcinoma and allowed reversing resistance to chemotherapy, by increasing intratumoral drug uptake. Based on our data, the comparison of gene expression profiling between CAFs before and after chemotherapy indicated the solid gene changes and provided candidate markers that might participate in chemotherapy resistance. Considering the correlation of breast cancer treatment and tumor microenvironment (especially CAFs), we suppose that the genes about membrane protein and secreted factors will be likely to associate with chemotherapy resistance. Then we have looked through the relevant literatures, to evaluate the research status and prospect of these genes, and eventually chosen CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 as candidate genes. The differential expression of these genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed by RT-RCR (p<0.05), suggesting potential predictors of response to treatment.CXCL2 is one member of a family of structurally related chemokines, which are also called ELR-positive subgroup of CXC-chemokines. It was reported that CXCL2 could enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro and differential expression of CXCL2 in colon cancer had impact on metastatic disease and survival. In addition, CXCL2 was found to show significantly different expression in 5-FU responder and nonresponder breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its relationship with chemotherapy response. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 has been focused on, in view of the association between its five polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Moreover, the study carried out by Li et al. established the relationship between TP and MMPs in cancer cell invasion. Recently, the up-regulation expression of MMP1 was observed during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude mice, indicating potential targets involved in the control of metastasis. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was indicated to correlate with the growth and progression of tumors. Some interesting observations were made with regard to the prognostic role of baseline plasma IL8 protein levels in breast cancer patients treated with weekly docetaxel. Besides, Snoussi et al. pointed out that the polymorphisms in IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2 are associated with increased breast cancer risk and disease progress, implying that IL-8 and CXCR2 might contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis and aggressiveness. Lee et al. found that increased expression of IL-8 in the tumor microenvironment enhanced colon cancer growth and metastasis, which is very inspiring for our research. All the above markers including CXCL2, MMP1 and IL-8 were up-regulated based on our study, while FGF1, RARRES1 and CXCR7 as follows were down-regulated.As is known, breast cancer cells overexpress fibroblast growth factor receptors. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was reported to be especially suitable as chemotherapeutic drug carrier in light of its biological activity. Additionally, FGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR could efficiently decrease breast cancer cell viability, suggesting the possibility for targeted therapy. According to these data, it could be assumed that decreased expression of FGF1 might be involved in the chemotherapy resistance. Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is a retinoid regulated gene, which is accounted as a tumor suppress gene and lost in many cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that the down-regulation of RARRES1 is related to tumor growth of colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The investigation on the role of RARRES1 in the chemotherapy resistance is still rare, therefore its decreased expression in CAFs after chemotherapy caused our attention. CXCR7, as well as CXCR4, have been known as the receptors of chemokine CXCL12. Liberman et al. considered that CXCR7 would elicit anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma. Recently Hernandez et al. found that CXCR7 impaired invasion of breast cancer, in contrast to CXCR4. We propose that CXCR7 would contribute to the chemotherapy resistance in the condition of treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in the abovementioned candidate genes, CXCL2, MMP1 and IL8 are recognized as secretory-type genes, which possibly could be tested in serum in the form of genes or proteins. Its relationship with prognosis will be studied.Overall, in this study we have primarily cultured CAFs, compared its gene expression profiling before and after chemotherapy, and picked up 6 candidate genes which are possibly associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. We hope that our study might supply the potential predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and possible targets for treatment, which could provide the patient with optimal therapeutic management and better prognosis. For further study, the molecular mechanism of these candidate markers will continue to be researched to elucidate their relationship with chemotherapy resistance.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer statistics, 2012Effects of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for early breast cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the randomised trialsImplication of tumor microenvironment in the resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patientsStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionRoots and stems: stem cells in cancerA stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancerRole of extracellular matrix assembly in interstitial transport in solid tumorsTargeting tumor-associated fibroblasts improves cancer chemotherapy by increasing intratumoral drug uptakeTumor microenvironment and breast cancer progression: A complex scenarioFibroblasts in cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor growth-bystanders turning into key playersA fibroblast-associated antigen: characterization in fibroblasts and immunoreactivity in smooth muscle differentiated stromal cellsEpithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer can provide a nonmalignant stromaBone marrow contribution to tumor-associated myofibroblasts and fibroblastsAdipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factorsp53 Attenuates cancer cell migration and invasion through repression of SDF-1/CXCL12 expression in stromal fibroblastsExpression of p21waf1/Cip1 in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast tumorsPten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary epithelial tumoursCaveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblastsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisImpact, mechanisms, and novel chemotherapy strategies for overcoming resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes in metastatic breast cancerAdvances in neoadjuvant (primary) systemic therapy with cytotoxic agentsResearch issues affecting preoperative systemic therapy for operable breast cancer17p12 deletion in breast cancer predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapyBRCA1 protein levels and PIK3CA mutations as predictive biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: An exploratory analysisHighly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from lung and breastThe role of CXC chemokines and their receptors in cancerDifferential expression of the chemokines GRO-2, GRO-3, and interleukin-8 in colon cancer and their impact on metastatic disease and survivalCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCurrent evidence on the relationship between five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) gene and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysisIncreased Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases Mediates Thromboxane A2-Induced Invasion in Lung Cancer CellsProtein expression changes during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude miceIncreased expression of MMP-9 and IL-8 are correlated with poor prognosis of Bladder CancerInterleukin-8 secretion by ovarian cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasionExpression of Angiogenic Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Treated with Weekly DocetaxelCombined effects of IL-8 and CXCR2 gene polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility and aggressivenessInterleukin-8 and its receptor CXCR2 in the tumour microenvironment promote colon cancer growth, progression and metastasisFGF-1 as a possible carrier for targeted drug deliveryFGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR efficiently decrease cell viability upon NIR irradiationTazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicityRole of the RARRES1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinomaRARRES1 expression is significantly related to tumour differentiation and staging in colorectal adenocarcinomaInvolvement of the CXCR7/CXCR4/CXCL12 Axis in the Malignant Progression of Human NeuroblastomaOpposing roles of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer metastasis"

Tumor microenvironment is a whole system which includes tumor cells, stroma cells (such as, adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the activated fibroblasts, which were named by Tlsty\u2019s group in the tissue of prostatic cancer in 1999, are the primary type of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were found in almost all solid tumor tissue (e.g. cancers of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer), and play an assignable role in tumor development by cell-cell interaction or cross-talk with tumor cells through secreting growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, CAFs are thought to be \u201cthe dark side of coin\u201d in tumor development.In contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs have some of phenotypical and functional abnormality. These alterations of CAFs may be due to its stable gene expression changes. So, whole breast carcinomas stromal by microdissection were explored to analyze the gene expression profiling. These studies have led to new classifications and risk stratification of breast carcinomas into several molecular subtypes based on their gene expression signatures. The global gene expression in the stromal cells has also been shown to powerfully predict prognosis and treatment response. A variety of differences have been identified between breast carcinoma-associated stroma and its paired normal mammary stroma, primarily resulting in increased expression of cytokines (EGF, HGF PDGF, TLL-12, SSP-1, POSTN, CXCL-12, and CXCL14), extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (FBN1, FB2M, SPARC, ADRA2A and ADM) and proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-13). These factors were involved in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells by directly or indirectly pattern to promote tumor cell proliferation, cell adhesion and invasion, ECM remodeling. Although, these studies give us the overall configuration of the tumor microenvironment, there are still poor on the role of each member in the tumor stroma, like CAFs, to contribute to the tumor development.Until most recently, the distinguishable features and gene expression profile of CAFs and NFs have been described in breast cancer by Bauer et al.. Their studies show that up-regulated WISP1, collagen type-X (COL10A) and TGF-\u03b2 isoforms in CAFs activate paracrine Wnt-1 signaling in human breast cancer cells or lead to abnormal ECM production in stroma separately. Loss of expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 may alter the hormonal milieu in breast carcinomas, and down-regulation of KLF4 participates in the differentiation of resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, there is still no systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between breast cancer CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of breast cancer CAFs feature and its roles to tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, whether these previous finding in CAFs derived from western country women are also existed in patients of other races.In light of these facts, the principal purpose of this work is to investigate the possible innate nature of biological and genetic heterogeneity between human breast CAFs versus matched NFs in Chinese women. We identified 824 differentially expressed genes: 809 of these were up-regulated, and 15 were down-regulated in CAFs, which included 8 cytokines. The abnormality of CAFs genes and its associated signaling pathways could be involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport, which were proved in CAFs of other tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we firstly discovered that the altered ATM signaling pathway, which was recently found related to reactive oxidative stress (ROS), is abnormally activation in the early stage of breast cancer. Cell cycle regulated signaling, such as P53 signaling pathway, RB tumor suppressor/checkpoint signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, Cdc25 and Chk1 regulatory pathway are identified to be changed in CAFs. A set of immune associated signaling are abnormality in CAFs, which include natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules. And more importantly, we found that CAFs would be able to promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture condition through up-regulated CCL18.Materials and MethodsTissue SamplesAll the human breast tumor tissues and its adjacent normal mammary tissues were collected at the time of surgical reaction at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy before surgery. Specimens used in this study were approved by the Ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation and Culture of Primary FibroblastsTumor tissue and paired normal mammary tissues were washed 3 times with sterile PBS with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin). The tissues were minced with sterile scissors in a fresh sterile culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (C0130, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, tissues were carefully pipetted up and down for a couple of times using culture medium. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. Then, the mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia) for about two days. Removed the suspending cells or tissue, the most adherent cells were fibroblasts. The primary fibroblasts isolated from tumor tissues were named \u201cCAFs\u201d, and from tumor paired normal tissues named \u201cNFs\u201d. Cell purity was identified by immunohistochemistry for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP following the standard described process previously and manufacture\u2019s protocols. Briefly, cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hours and fixed within 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% triton-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1\u2236150) for targeting fibronectin (F3648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam Cambridge) and FAP (ab53066, Abcam Cambridge, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were then stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1\u2236100, ZF-0311, Zhongshan Goldenbrdge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i microscope (Eclipse 80 i, Tokyo, Japan; magnification\u00d7100).MTT and Flow Cytometric AnalysisCell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plate at 5\u00d7103 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l of complete growth medium. Cell growth was measured every day. Incubating for the designed time, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of isopropanol with 0.04 N of HCl was added to each well, and the plates were shaken on a rotator for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. The independent experiments were repeated for five times.S-phase was analyzed by using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA as previously described. A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize the statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. Triplicate independent experiments were done.Preparation of Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 cells, CAFs and NFs were cultured in complete growth DMEM for 48 h to approximately 80% confluence. The medium was changed to 0.5% FBS DMEM and cells were kept in culture for another 30 to 36 h. For neutralization experiments, neutralizing antibodies against human CXCL-12 (500 ng/ml), CCL18 (10 \u00b5g/ml), CCL4 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) and control IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were separately preincubated at 37\u00b0C with supernatant for 1 h before performing migration assays. The medium was centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM).Cell Migration and Invasion AssayCell invasion or migration assay was measured via modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 \u00b5l serum-free medium were seeded in the wells of 8 \u00b5m-pore membrance modified Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with ECM (1\u22367.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10% FBS Medium, CM, CM with secreting factor CXCL-12 (100 nM), CCL18 (500 ng/ml) or CCL4 (100 nM) was separately added into the lower or upper chamber as the designed purpose. After 6 h or 12 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5%, cells adhered to the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton applicator. Stained with hematoxylin in methanol, the invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were counted. The data represent at least three experiments done in triplicate (mean\u00b1standard error).RNA Isolation, Quantitative Real-time PCR and Microarray AnalysisTotal RNA isolated from six paired CAFs and NFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA quantity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry. Probe synthesis and hybridization performed as the manufacture\u2019s instruction were used to probe the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (44 K; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were generated after scanning by using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The raw data were normalized using quantize normalization and then analyzed by GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Paired Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was applied to identify differentially expressed mRNA in CAFs and NFs. SAM output was filtered by q\u200a=\u200a0.1. Heatmap.2 function (R v2.14.0, gplots package v2.9.0) was used to plot the scaled expression data of differentially expressed mRNAs.An additional two expression datasets (GSE20086 and GSE29270) on breast cancer associated fibroblasts were downloaded from the GEO website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The raw data of six matched CAFs and NFs in GSE20086 were normalized using the R package gcRMA, GCRMA normalized. The author\u2019s processed data of 15 matched CAFs and NFs in GSE29270 were used in next analysis. Paired SAM were also used to analysis the different expression genes in CAFs versus NFs. In cytokines analysis process, the genes at least fold change >1.5 with an estimated FDR<10% were considered as dysregulated genes.RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). To confirm the differential gene expression pattern revealed by microarray analysis, 9 of randomly selected genes (CDC6, FLI1, S100A9, CDK1, PLK1, MMP9, PECAM1, SHC2 and C9ORF135) were re-proved by qRT-PCR assay. Specific Real-time PCR primers for each of selected genes were listed as Table 1. qRT-PCR was performed by a Bio-Rad CFX Manager instrument (Applied Biosystems) at 94\u00b0C for 15 Sec, Tm\u00b0C for 20 Sec and at 65\u00b0C for 30 Sec using SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II (Takara, Dalian, China). GAPDH were used as internal control for normalizing different samples.Primer sequences for qRT-PCR.Gene\tForward 5\u2018\u20133'\tReverse 5\u2018\u20133'\tSize (bp)\t \tFN\tAACTTCCTGGTGCGTTACTCA\tTGTGCTCTCATGTTGTTCGT\t156\t \t\u03b1-SMA\tGAGGCACCCCTGAACCCCAA\tATCTCCAGAGTCCAGCACGA\t153\t \tFAP\tTGTTCCAGCAATGATAGCC\tCTGCTTTCTTCTATATGCTCC\t186\t \tCDC6\tCCAGGCACAGGCTACAATCAGT\tACACGAGGAGAACAGGTTACGG\t126\t \tS100A9\tGCACCCAGACACCCTGAACC\tACCCTCGTGCATCTTCTCGT\t211\t \tFLI1\tCCACCCTCTACAACACGGAA\tATGTTATTGCCCCAAGCTC\t166\t \tCDK1\tGGATCTACCATACCCATTGAC\tTGGCTACCACTTGACCTGT\t120\t \tPLK1\tAATTACATAGCTCCCGAGGTG\tAGCCAGAAGTAAAGAACTCGTC\t118\t \tMMP9\tTCCCTGGAGACCTGAGAACC\tGGCAAGTCTTCCGAGTAGTTT\t307\t \tPECAM1\tACTCAAATGATCCTGCGGTA\tACTTAACATTTTGGCATGGGA\t98\t \tSHC2\tGCACCTGTATGTCAACACCCA\tTCCTCAAAGGGTCGCATGTCA\t90\t \tC9ORF135\tTCCCATGGATAGCCTTGACA\tGTGCCAGGAATACACCAAC\t160\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \tCCL18\tCCGCCTCGTCTATACCTCC\tCACTTCTTATTGGGGTCAGC\t141\t \tCCL4\tTTCCTCGCAACTTTGTGGTA\tCAGGTCATACACGTACTCC\t140\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \t\nNote: FN, Fibronectin; \u03b1-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; CDC6, cell division cycle 6 homolog; S100A9, S100 calcium binding protein A9; FLI1, Friend leukemia virus integration 1; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; PLK1, polo-like kinase 1; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; PECAM1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule; SHC2, SHC transforming protein 2; C9ORF135, chromosome 9 open reading frame 135; CXCL12, chemokine ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1);CCL18, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18; CCL4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4.ELISA AssaySupernatant from NFs or CAFs were harvested and subjected to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for measuring the immunoreactive levels of CXCL-12, CCL18 and CCL4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the instructions as supplied by the manufacturer. The ELISA assay was carried out in duplicate in three separate experiments.Gene Ontology and Pathway AnalysisFor detection of significantly over-represented GO biological processes, the Onto-Express analysis tool was used and the permutated P-value cut-off was set below 0.05. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was conducted through the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool and the significantly changed signaling pathways were selected based on P<0.01.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done using SPSS standard version 13.0 software. Data was shown as means \u00b1 SD from at least three independent determinations. Significance of difference was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant differences.ResultsIsolation and Identification of CAFs and NFsCAFs and their paired NFs were successfully isolated from six primary breast carcinomas and from adjacent normal breast tissue. The primary fibroblasts were successfully cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Both CAFs and NFs could be grown for at least 10 passages. Both CAFs and NFs showed spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A). But the senescence-like cell would be appeared when the cell culture was more than 6 passages (Data not shown).Characterization of fibroblasts isolated from human breast tissue samples.A. Representative cell morphology of CAFs and NFs. B. Identification of CAFs using fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, and CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP by immunofluorescence staining. C. The biomarker gene expression in CAFs and NFs was re-proved by qTR-PCR, and its relative fold change in CAFs and NFs was displayed. The CAFs and NFs are positive for fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP are high expression in CAFs (magnification 100\u00d7 (cell morphology); 200\u00d7 (Biomarker immunofluorescence staining).The purity of CAFs was identified by fibronectin, which is the fibroblast biomarkers, and CAFs-specific biomarkers including \u03b1-SMA and FAP, respectively. NF and CAFs were positive for fibronectin, more than 95% of CAFs were stained by \u03b1-SMA and FAP (Fig. 1B). These biomarker expression changes were reproved by qRT-PCR in 3 paired of CAFs and NF (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue.The Noticeable Heterogeneity of Proliferation, Migration and Invasion between CAFs and NFsThe cell growth assay revealed that CAFs were endowed a significantly growth rate than that of NFs in the same culture conditions (P<0.05; Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells in the S phases measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in CAFs (33.3\u00b17.1, N>3) compared with NFs (6.6\u00b12.5, N>3) (P<0.05). These data suggested that CAFs had a stronger capacity for proliferation than their paired NFs (Fig. 2B\u2013C). Similarly, CAFs had strong potent ability of migration (Fig. 3A\u2013B) and invasion (Fig. 3C) than its paired NFs.Significant difference of proliferation between CAFs and NFs.A. Cell proliferation determined by MTT assay for three of CAFs and NFs. B. Representative DNA content of CAFs and NFs were tested by flow cytometry. C. The percentages of cells in each of cell cycle phases shown by histogram for CAFs vs. NFs. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u22653 separate experiments (**P<0.01).The migration and invasion of CAFs compared with NFs.A. Cell migration capability was determined by wound healing assay. B. The distance of wound closure (compared with control at 0 h) was measured in four-independent wound sites each group after 24 h. C. The invasion capability of CAFs and NFs was determined by Transwell assay. D. The migrated cells of CAFs and NFs shown by a histogram. Data were shown as mean\u00b1SD of 5 repeats. (**P<0.01), (magnification A. 100\u00d7; C. 200\u00d7).CAFs Stimulate Tumor Cell Growth, Migration and InvasionIn order to understand the interaction cross-talk of CAFs with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, co-culture system was employed to display their role in the cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from NFs (NFs CM) and control, MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from CAFs (CAFs CM) had significant proliferation (P<0.05; Fig. 4A) assayed by cell growth curve. The proportion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase cultured in CAFs CM (29.8\u00b10.8, N\u200a=\u200a3) was obviously more than that in NFs CM (13.0\u00b12.2, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.01) and control (23.5\u00b11.4, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.05) (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Collectively these studies demonstrate that CAFs had a stronger capacity promoting tumor cell proliferation than their paired NFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the increasing cell invasion was found in the co-culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells with CAFs CM, as compared with the system containing NFs CM or control medium (Fig. 5A\u2013D).CAFs promote proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in co-culture system compared with NFs.A.

The histogram to show the average migrated cells each view (F). Data is representative of 5 views (**P<0.01), (magnification: A, B 100\u00d7; E 200\u00d7).To examine whether tumor cells play a role in the biologic behavior of fibroblasts in the stroma, the effect of MDA-MB-231 on the migration of CAFs and NFs was compared. As predicted, more migrated cells were tested in the co-culture of CAFs and CM from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5E\u2013F). These data indicated that different effects existed in the cross-talk of tumor cells and fibroblasts.Genes Differentially Expressed between CAFs and NFsTo reveal the essence of the heterogeneity of biologic characteristic between CAFs and NFs in the breast carcinoma microenvironment, gene expression profile was investigated by micro-array assay. Total RNA derived from six paired CAFs and NFs isolated from primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade \u0399\u0399 were used in this analysis. Gene expression profiles of pooled CAFs and their pooled normal counterparts were obtained by microarray analysis using the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (Fig. 6A). A total of 25,206 probe sets (transcripts) were present in human breast carcinomas-derived fibroblasts relative to their normal controls. Compared with the expression profile of NFs, 809 up-regulated genes (0.9%) and only 15 down-regulated genes (0.45%) were detected in CAFs using an arbitrary cutoff line of signal log ratio of \u22651.8 or \u2264\u22121.8. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6); Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1); S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP9), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) were predominantly over-expressed at high levels in CAFs whereas SHC transforming protein 2 (SHC2) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 135 (C9ORF135) were down-regulated with a high array intensity (Table S1 and Table S2).Gene heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs.A. HeatMap of gene expression data obtained by Agilent micro-arrays analysis from CAF and NF isolated from all six cases (BCa 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis. B. The mRNA levels of 9 genes selected randomly were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C. Signaling pathway analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathway in CAFs vs. NFs.The up-regulated genes encoded for secreted proteins were mostly classified into groups of extracellular region, cell proliferation, and signal transducer activity (Table S3). To validate the microarray data, the expression level of 9 randomly selected genes including 7 of up-regulated genes and 2 of down-regulated genes were re-proved by qRT-PCR between CAFs and NFs (Fig. 6B). Compared with NFs, the expression pattern of all differentially expressed genes in CAFs detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with the microarray results.The Unanimity Heterogeneity of Biological Characteristics and Genes Expressed in CAFsMicroarray assay displayed that most genes up-regulated in CAFs have oncogenic function, including growth factors (FGF2, VEGFC, PDGFC, CASC5, and HGFAC), transcription regulators (MKX, RUNX3, ATAD2, FOXM1, and PTTG1), cell proliferation-associated genes (CENPF, PLK1, BUB1, KIF15, and CRIP1) and members of the Wnt signal pathway (WNT1, WNT5A, LRP6, TCF4, and GBP4). Several genes encoding secreted proteins, such as CCL18, CXCL12, MCM10, ADAMDEC1, MMP9, and S100A9 were also significantly up-regulated in CAFs (Table S3). All of these secreted proteins are able to induce cell proliferation, implying that CAFs play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells.Additionally, microarray results suggest that CAFs may facilitate invasion and metastasis of breast tumor cells. The data listing in Table S1 shows that CAFs promote tumor cell invasion mainly via two of mechanisms: (a) altering tumor microenvironment interactions (tumor-stroma and tumor-tumor) by increasing cell adhesion (PECAM1, ITGAX, CCL4, LPP, and SIGLEC8) and cell-cell interaction signaling (CCL18, DLGAP5, C1QA, STAB1, and TEK), and (b) promoting extracellular region degradation (LYZ, C1QB, MMP9, IGLL1, and IGHG1) surrounding tumor cells (Table S3).Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathways showed that CAFs enriched many serviceable signaling pathways in contrast to NFs in human breast cancer. Maximum change pathways in CAFs were cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathways associated with cell cycle. Compared with NFs, the cell cycle and DNA replication signal pathway in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times, respectively. The alteration of the ATM signaling pathway was absolute significantly. It was recently reported that the ATM signaling was activated under oxidative stress. Our preliminary data indicated that activated ATM signaling was in responsible for cell proliferation of fibroblasts (Data not shown). The change of other pathways was also assignable, such as DNA replication signal pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, PI3k signaling pathways, abnormal activated p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6C). Herein, the heterogeneity of genes expressed between CAFs and NFs was consistent with their heterogeneity of biological characteristics.The Common Cytokines-CCL18 Obtained by Compared with Published Microarray DataTo compare the shared genes in current work with previous publication in breast cancer CAFs, the mRNA microarray data of breast cancer CAFs and its paired NFs stored in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE20086 and GSE29270) were used. As shown in Fig. 7, the dysregulated genes of CAFs are 136 (M Bauer), 1339 (M Basik), and 1102 in current work, respectively. The shared dysregulated genes among each of these data were 12 (Bauer\u2019s data vs. Basik\u2019s data), 7 (Local data vs. Bauer\u2019s data), and 93 (Local data vs. Basik\u2019s data). These data indicate that high heterogeneity is indeed existed in the CAFs of breast cancer. The similarity was found for cytokines and chemokines genes in the CAFs. The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained in comparing the current data with Basik\u2019s microarray data.The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained by compared with published microarray data.The number of dysregulated difference genes and shared genes from current work and two other studies in breast cancer associated CAF versus paired NF was displayed in each group. Dysregulated Cytokines in each study were listed. Only the common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained compared local data with Basik\u2019s microarray data (GSE29270).CAFs Provide a Suitable Microenvironment for Tumor Cell InvasionImmune-related genes, including various chemokines (CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18), are also differentially expressed in CAFs (Fig. 6C and 8A). Chemokines secreted by stromal cells surrounding tumor tissue have been associated with tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells. To understand whether CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18 involving in the cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells, tumor cell invasion was analyzed in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231, or NFs and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B and 8D, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 immunoneutralizing antibody in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 reduced tumor cell invasion by nearly 60%. However, Condition medium (CM) with neutralizing antibody CCL4 had no significantly affect on tumor cell invasion. On the other hand, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 ligand, not CCL4 ligand in the co-culture system of NFs and MDA-MB-231 enhanced transmigration of tumor cells by around 3-fold (Fig. 8C and 8E). Collectively, these studies indicate that the up-regulated chemokine genes in CAFs have contributed to suitable microenvironments for tumor cell invasion.CCL18 and CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promote tumor cell invasion in cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells.A. The mRNA levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. B. The protein expression levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by ELISA in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C-F. Transwell migration assays were used to determine the functional significance of cytokines secreted by CAFs on tumor invasion. Assays were conducted by using either immunoneutralizing antibody (C and E) or addition of ligands (D and F) in the co-culture system. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u200a=\u200a3 separate experiments (**P<0.01), (magnification 100\u00d7).DiscussionCancer-associated fibroblasts have been recognized for their impact on the carcinogenesis, promotion and progression of many carcinomas. Breast cancer is notoriously associated with tumor microenvironment stroma with activated fibroblasts. However, relatively little is known about the relationship of biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs in the stroma of human breast carcinoma. Herein, this study focused on the gene expression profile of human breast cancer-derived fibroblasts in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of how fibroblasts induce a favorable microenvironment to cancer development.CAFs had several pivotal biological characteristics compared with NFs in human breast cancer. Using the CAFs and its paired NFs isolated from breast cancer tissue, the proliferation, migration and invasion of CAFs themselves were memorably higher than that of NFs in breast cancer. And CAFs had the potential capacity for the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Furthermore, the invasion ability of CAFs and breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 could significantly be increased under the co-culture system of tumor cells and CAFs or NFs cells.In line with the finding of the biological difference between CAFs and NFs, the heterogeneity of genes expression profiles and signal pathways were highly consistent with the biological characteristics of CAFs and NFs. The huge heterogeneity of gene expression was found between CAFs and NFs (Table S1 and S2). For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cancer susceptibility candidate 5 (CASC5) took part in the regulating proliferation of CAF itself and tumor cell.Compared with NFs, over-expressed genes in CAFs afford several interesting insights into the dynamics of the carcinoma microenvironment through the special GO Catalogue. The gene ontology and signaling pathway analysis showed that the cell cycle and cell cycle regulated signaling pathways in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times respectively, compared with NFs. Traditionally, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were cancer suppressor gene, but p53 signaling pathway abnormal activated and over-expressed of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATR in CAFs may involve in other function in the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, ATM signaling pathway and cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathway may be related to cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress, although they were in responds to DNA damage or DNA strand break in traditionally. These data demonstrated that the vigorous proliferation of CAFs than NFs by some special activated signal pathway. However, the details will be further study for our next work.Moreover, the different invasion capacity between CAFs and NFs may be supported by other sets of genes expression (e.g. FOXM1, MMP9, PTTG1, IGHG1, TM4SF19, S100A9, SDCBP) in the CAFs and NFs. Heterogeneity of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) were involved in cancer invasion and migration. In breast cancer, the securin protein stability of PTTG1 was correlated with securin accumulation. Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) and transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19) were related to tumor immune invasion mechanisms and then made the tumor cells immunity. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) has been revealed as the metastasis-inducing protein. Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) was reported involving in cancer metastatic progression. These results support the function of fibroblasts in breast carcinoma to promote cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.Furthermore, CAFs recruited numerous cells related with tumor angiogenesis, infiltration, which promoted the tumor invasion and metastasis, through secreted some special chemical chemotactic factors. For example, CXCL14 derived from CAFs in prostate cancer and SDF1/CXCL12 derived from CAFs in breast cancer called up macrophages, endothelial cells derived from bone marrow source, M2 mononuclear cells to the tumor tissue respectively, which assisted the tumor formation new blood and lymph vessels. Chemokine signaling pathway and PI3k signaling pathways enriched in CAFs also illustrated that CAFs could promote itself and the cancer cell invasion and migration. These studies suggest that a close and frequent crosstalk between the CAFs and tumor cells exists during tumor invasion and metastasis process.In addition, a set of signaling associated with immune response, activation or immune escape were found in this study. For example, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules are abnormality compared with NFs. Although, its roles in the microenvironment to promote tumorigenesis and/or development for breast carcinoma are keeping study, these finding in current work indicate that CAFs may involve in immune response and/or immune escape of tumor cell.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinBreast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironmentBreast cancer\u2013one term, many entities?Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of a lingual carcinoma cell line by secreting keratinocyte growth factorCancer-associated orthotopic myofibroblasts stimulates the motility of gastric carcinoma cellsRole of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer to the liver and their expression profilesCasbas-Hernandez P, Fleming JM, Troester MA (2011) Gene Expression Analysis of In Vitro Cocultures to Study Interactions between Breast Epithelium and Stroma.

Despite the fact that most of our understanding of cancer centers on those events taking place within the cancer epithelium, the cancer-associated stroma also plays a co-dominant role in shaping the biological and clinical fates of the disease. Specifically, the carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) has been shown to be a major player in the stroma\u2019s influence on tumor growth. Many reports have focused on the role that CAFs have in regulating TGF-\u03b2 signalling and angiogenesis through secreted factors such as SDF-1 and VEGF. CAFs have shown the ability to both promote and repress MCF-7 cell growth in vitro, in addition to having no effect at all. Importantly, none of these studies took account of possible inter-patient CAF heterogeneity largely because, unlike tumor heterogeneity, little data exists about inter-patient CAF heterogeneity.In particular, one in vitro model using a series of breast cancer cell lines directly co-cultured with normal human fibroblasts demonstrated that human fibroblasts will induce a type-one interferon response when admixed with tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, this type-one interferon response signature was shown to be expressed in a large proportion of breast tumors contained in the NKI breast tumor microarray dataset and its expression in whole breast tumors was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis. In addition, this outcome was confirmed in an independent patient cohort in which immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-STAT1 was used as a proxy for the presence of the type-one interferon response.In this report we show that there exists a subset of CAFs which express a type one interferon response which is stable upon ex vivo cultivation. This interferon response can impart a paracrine growth-promoting effect on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Our findings suggest that an understanding of CAF molecular heterogeneity can be used to construct relevant preclinical in vitro models of tumor-stromal interactions.MethodsTissue culturePrimary tissue culture was carried out as previously outlined. Briefly, invasive breast carcinoma specimens were surgically resected from patients at the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Canada). CAFs were determined to be intratumoral by a certified pathologist. Tissues were minced with a sterile blade and resuspended in a solution of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 3% collagenase overnight at 37 degrees Celsius. The next day samples were filtered through an 8\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0mesh in order to remove undigested debris. The single cell suspension with viable fibroblasts was cultured in DMEM (10% FBS) for 2\u20133 weeks in a 24 well plate and then transferred to a T75 flask where it was continually maintained in a 2% FBS medium solution. All fibroblasts were harvested between passage doublings 3\u20135. Normal breast fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasties were collected at the same institution and in the same manner as the CAFs noted above. All fibroblast cultures underwent immunocytochemical analyses for pan-cytokeratin and vimentin as previously described by our group to confirm their mesenchymal identity. All protocols involving human tissues were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research of McGill University and were in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Furthermore, all tissues procured from both reduction mammoplasty and tumor resection surgeries were obtained with the written informed consent of all patients.DNA microarray expression profilingGene expression profiling was carried out as described previously. Briefly, fibroblasts were harvested from subconfluent cultures, cultivated in DMEM with 2% FBS. RNA was then extracted using the Mini RNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Five micrograms of total RNA was reversed transcribed with the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Aglient Technologies, Santa Clara, California). The resulting cDNA was then precipitated with 70% ethanol, air-dried, resuspended in 5\u00a0\u03bcL of coupling buffer, and dissolved at 37\u00b0C for 15\u00a0minutes. Five microliters of Cy3 or Cy5 dye were added to the universal reference (Aglient Technologies) or fibroblast cDNA, respectively, and allowed to incorporate for 30\u00a0minutes at room temperature. Labeled cDNA was cleaned-up using Fairplay columns (Aglient Technologies) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Labeled reference and fibroblast cDNA samples were combined and mixed with gene expression hybridization buffer and control targets supplied by the manufacturer and hybridized to a 4\u2009\u00d7\u200944\u00a0K two-color whole human genome gene expression array for 17\u00a0hours at 65\u00b0C. The array was then washed in a solution of 6\u00d7 SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine followed by a solution of 0.06\u00d7 SSPE, 0.005% lauroylsarcosine and scanned on the Agilent DNA Microarray scanner at a resolution of 5\u00a0\u03bcm. All images were extracted and normalized with Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The microarray data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE29270.Analysis of fibroblast and Co-culture expression profiling dataBreast carcinoma derived fibroblasts were cultured and expression profiled as outlined previously by our group. This dataset was analyzed using the straight-forward approach demonstrated by Sorlie and colleagues: any gene that was two-fold above the median value for that gene in at least 3 patient samples was retained. Unsupervised clustering (Pearson\u2019s correlation) was then performed using TIGR MeV version 4.1. In the case of the expression profiling on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, the three conditions (see below) were compared in a supervised 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 manner using the SAM algorithm. The samples were then clustered in the same way as the unsupervised manner. This was also carried out by using TIGR MeV version 4.1.Interferon-\u03b2 Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA)Subconfluent fibroblast cultures were allowed to incubate in DMEM (2% FBS) for 48\u00a0hours at which time the medium was collected and spun down for five minutes at 1500\u00a0rpm in order to remove debris. An ELISA assay was carried out as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the Human Interferon-\u03b2 kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota).In vitro co-culture modelAll experiments were carried out in DMEM media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. 5000 MCF-7 cells (American Tissue Type Collection, Manassas, Virginia) were plated into flat bottom 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. 600\u00a0\u03bcl of fresh media was then added and a semi-permeable insert with a 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm pore size (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) was placed over the media. 5000 fibroblasts were then seeded into the insert, re-suspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcl of media for a total co-culture volume of 1\u00a0ml/well. Monoclonal antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added at this time if necessary. After co-cultures had incubated for the appropriate time, inserts and fibroblasts were removed and MTT reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) was added to the media (1:10 ratio) and allowed to incubate for 2\u00a0hours after which the media was aspirated and 1\u00a0ml of DMSO was added. The absorbance was measured at 570\u00a0nm. For RNA or protein harvesting, co-cultures were performed in 6-well dishes with appropriate transwell insert (Millipore) using 25,000 of each cell type in a total co-culture volume of 4\u00a0ml. After the appropriate co-incubation time, cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA harvesting.Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-RT-PCR)Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Stratagene\u2019s AffinityScript Multiple Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u00a0\u03bcl of oligo(dT) primer was added to 5ug of total RNA and allowed to incubate at 65\u00b0C for five minutes. The reaction was subsequently cooled to room temperature. The following reactants were then added for a total volume of 20\u00a0\u03bcl : 2.0\u00a0\u03bcl of 10\u00d7 AffinityScript RT Buffer, 0.8\u00a0\u03bcl of dNTP mix (25\u00a0mM of each dNTP), 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl of RNase Block Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcl) and 1\u00a0\u03bcl of reverse transcriptase. The reaction was carried out at 42\u00b0C for one hour and terminated by a 15\u00a0minute incubation at 70\u00b0C. The parameters for the interferon-associated Q-RT-PCR were adapted from Buess et al.. PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcl. Two micrograms of synthesized cDNA, 5\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00d7 SYBR \u00aeGreen PCR Master Mix (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) and 1\u00a0\u03bcl (10\u00a0\u03bcM ) of each primer (sequences: OAS2, forward GGAATACCTGAAGCCCTACGAA, reverse CCTGCAGACGTCACAGATGGT; IFN\u03b2, forward ACCTCCGAAACTGAAGATCTCCTA, reverse TGCTGGTTGAAGAATGCTTGA; GAPDH, forward GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC, reverse GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC). Primers were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California) and adapted from Buess et al. All reactions were carried out in an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System using the following amplification conditions: 50\u00b0C for 2\u00a0minutes, 94\u00b0C for 10\u00a0minutes, followed by 40\u00a0cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 60\u00a0seconds. All reactions were carried out in triplicate.NKI295 database analysisPatients were split into high and low expressers of our IFN signature by hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean and Ward\u2019s algorithm. A univariate Kaplan Meier analysis was then carried out in order to assess the prognostic significance of the IFN signature. Secondly, patients in the NKI patient cohort were split into two groups (high and low) based on their expression of S100A2 using hierarchical clustering. The low and high S100A2 expresser groups were separately clustered with the IFN signature. Kaplan Meier curves were subsequently generated.ResultsGene expression profiling reveals the presence of a CAF subtype that is positive for a type one interferon responseHierarchical clustering of CAFs reveals interferon positive CAF subset. (A) Hierarchical clustering (HCL) of the 23 CAFs. DNA microarray data were filtered for genes that were 2-fold above or below the mean for that gene in a minimum of 3 samples. This resulted in a total of 2506 genes which are shown clustered above. (B) Magnification of the gene cluster highlighted by the red bar in Figure\u00a01A. Further inspection of this cluster shows the upregulation of many type-one interferon genes in addition to a host of cytokines in five of the CAFs analyzed. (C) An IFN-\u03b2 ELISA of DMEM (2% FBS) cultured with sub-confluent fibroblasts (3 normal breast fibroblast, 3 IFN-negative CAFs and 3 IFN-positive CAFs) for 48\u00a0hours. IFN-\u03b2 ligand was only detected in the 3 IFN-positive CAF supernatents. (D) Q-RT-PCR analysis on frozen whole tumor sections corresponding to two IFN-positive and two IFN-negative CAFs. The IFN-positive CAFs (T35 and T44) showed a greatly increased level of both IFN markers IFN-\u03b2 and OAS2 relative to the IFN-negative tumors (T77 and T79) (p\u2009<\u20090.001, by way of Bonferroni Multiple comparison test following a one-way ANOVA).Interrogation of the NKI295 breast cancer microarray dataset for the clinical significance of the IFN signature shown in Figure1. (A) the IFN signature was able to divide the cohort into two groups; one consisting of 154 patients (high IFN expressers) and the second consisting of 141 patients (low IFN expressers). Bars at the bottom of the figure indicate various histopathological characteristics of the tumors/patients whose microarray data appear in the corresponding column. \u2018Outcome\u2019: red denotes recurrence, white denotes no recurrence. \u2018Grade\u2019 refers to the histological grade of the breast carcinoma: red is grade 3, pink is grade 2 and white is grade 1. \u2018Lymph node\u2019: red indicates that the patient has axillary lymph node dissemination of the breast carcinoma, whereas white is negative for lymph node dissemination. \u2018HER2\u2019: orange indicates that the patient\u2019s carcinoma was positive for HER2 over-expression, and white indicates negativity. \u2018ER\u2019: green indicates estrogen positive disease and white indicates estrogen receptor negative disease. \u2018Interferon\u2019: red are patients who cluster in the interferon positive group and blue are patients who do not overexpress the interferon cluster of genes. \u2018Wound\u2019: red denotes patients who are positive for the wound response signature of Chang et al. and blue are those that do not overexpress the wound response. (B) These two distinct groups had a significantly different outcome with the high expressers of IFN displaying a greater rate of recurrence than the low IFN expressers.We carried out gene expression profiling of primary breast CAFs. This dataset consisted of 23 patient-derived CAFs that were cultured for a minimum of 3 doublings and a maximum of 6 doublings in low serum conditions. In these analyses the data were filtered for the most variably expressed genes; any gene that was 2-fold above or below the mean for that gene in at least 3 of the 23 samples was retained. This strategy yielded a filtered list of 2506 genes. Upon hierarchical clustering the CAF cohort was clearly subdivided into two distinct groups (Figure\u00a01A). Upon closer inspection it was evident that a group of 5 CAFs (T35, T63, T38, T44, T65) clustered tightly together and that this pattern was largely due to the overexpression of a coordinated gene cluster (Figure\u00a01B). This expression block consisted of 101 genes and has members such as MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS2, IFI27 and IFI30 greatly overexpressed within it, compared to the other CAFs, strongly suggesting that it represents an activated type one interferon response pattern. The type one interferon mediators were present in addition to several cytokine and chemokine transcripts (Figure\u00a01B). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of two key interferon response genes, MX1 and OAS2, validated microarray gene expression results (Additional file 1: Figure S1) showing significantly higher expression levels in CAFs found within the activated interferon response cluster. In addition, Q-RT-PCR analysis of the IFN-\u03b2 gene was correlated with RNA expression of MX1, suggesting that this particular type one interferon response was likely due to interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) ligand expression (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Specifically, by Q-PCR, the five highest expressers of IFN-b were T65, T63, T73, T44, T38 which had an average MX1/GAPDH QPCR ratio of 3.19 versus a ratio of 0.05 in the rest of the cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Four of these five CAFs grouped closely in the microarray clustering data with the one that did not (T73CAF) still showing positivity for much of the IFN gene expression cluster (Figure\u00a01). Next, by way of ELISA, we confirmed the presence of the IFN-\u03b2 ligand in the tissue culture supernatants of activated IFN-response CAFs and lack of the ligand in normal breast fibroblasts and IFN-negative CAFs (Figure\u00a01C). We then found that RNA extracted from two whole tumor sections whose CAFs were deemed negative for the type one interferon response via microarray and Q-RT-PCR analyses, showed considerably lower levels of both IFN-\u03b2 and OAS2 as compared to whole tumors from two patients from whom activated interferon response CAFs were obtained (Figure\u00a01D). These findings suggest that the interferon response we observed in our CAFs was unlikely due to an ex vivo tissue culture artefact. Finally, we used our 101 gene CAF-derived cytokine-enriched interferon signature to interrogate the NKI295 breast cancer microarray dataset (Figure\u00a02). Consistent with Buess et al\u2019s findings, our cytokine enriched interferon signature was deemed to be over expressed in 154 of the 295 patients and patients with tumors showing such over-expession showed a worse outcome than those with tumors that fell into the interferon negative group (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.56, p\u2009=\u20090.0037).Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts impart pro-cancer effects on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in an indirect heterotypic co-culture systemMCF-7-CAF co-culture phenotype. Three types of fibroblasts were involved in co-cultures with the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Normal breast fibrobasts are denoted in green, IFN-negative CAFs in blue and IFN-positive CAFs in red. All experiments were performed in triplicate. A single 120\u00a0hour time point is shown. Statistical differences were ascertained by an analysis of variance. Double asterisks represent samples that were deemed to be significantly different (p\u2009<\u20090.01) from the MCF-7 grown in mono-culture (post-hoc test: Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test). Five of six CAFs showed significant growth promotion of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in this model.In order to test the effects of IFN-positive CAFs on the growth of breast cancer cells we developed an in vitro co-culture model in which fibroblasts were indirectly co-cultured with the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line for 120\u00a0hours. The fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells were separated by a semi-permeable membrane (pore size of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm) with the MCF-7 cells being cultured on the bottom layer. At the desired time point, the transwell insert containing the fibroblasts was discarded and the MCF-7\u00a0s were either assayed by way of the MTT cell viability reagent or harvested for RNA and/or protein. Fibroblasts from three of each type of patient (IFN-negative, IFN-positive and normal reduction mammoplasty) were co-cultured with the breast cancer cell line. We found that co-culturing CAFs with MCF-7 breast cancer cells increased the proliferation rate of the latter, unlike co-culturing with normal breast fibroblasts (NBF) (Figure\u00a03). Interestingly, one of the IFN-negative CAFs (T48CAF) was not capable of promoting MCF-7 proliferation, while the other two IFN-negative CAFs increased MCF-7 cell proliferation to an equal or greater degree as compared to the three IFN-positive CAFs.The pro-MCF-7 effects by IFN-positive CAFs are dependent on the continued action of the IFN-\u03b2 ligand whereas this is not a requirement for the pro-MCF-7 effects of the IFN-negative CAFsIFN-\u03b2 is responsible for the positive effect of IFN-positive CAFs on MCF-7 proliferation. Three IFN-positive CAFs, T38, T44, T65, were co-cultured as previously described. In this experiment, two new conditions where added: once triplicate for each day was reserved for the addition of 20\u00a0\u03bcg of an IgG1 isotype control antibody (second darkest shade) and another for 20\u00a0\u03bcg of neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 antibody (darkest shade). A Bonferonni multiple comparison test was carried out after a one-way ANOVA was performed on the four conditions at 120\u00a0hours. The asterisks represent the significant difference between the co-culture with the IgG isotype control and the co-culture with the neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 antibody (*, p\u2009<\u20090.05; ***, p\u2009<\u20090.001).To determine if the type-one interferon response in CAFs is responsible for their ability to promote MCF-7 growth, we repeated the co-culture proliferation assays in the presence of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against the IFN-\u03b2 ligand in the co-culture medium (Figure\u00a04). When IFN-\u03b2 antibody was added to the culture medium, all 3 co-cultures involving the IFN-positive CAFs demonstrated a significant reversion of the phenotype, to proliferation levels very near that of MCF-7 cells cultured in the absence of CAFs. Thus the pro-proliferative effect on MCF-7 cells of the IFN-positive CAFs is dependent on the presence of IFN-\u03b2. Of note, the addition of the anti-IFN-\u03b2 antibody did not result in reversal of growth promoting effects in co-cultures with IFN-negative CAFs (Additional file 3: Figure S3).Microarray analysis of the IFN-positive-CAF-MCF-7 co-cultures reveals the presence of the candidate tumor suppressor gene S100A2 as a putative mediator of the pro-cancer heterotypic phenotypeGene expression analysis shows that S100A2 expression in MCF-7 cells is modulated by the activity of IFN-positive CAFs. (A) A 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 SAM analysis was carried out to compare MCF-7\u00a0s under three different conditions: MCF-7 monocultured with only the IgG1 antibody, MCF-7 co-cultured with two IFN-positive CAFs and the IgG1 antibody, and MCF-7 co-cultured with the same two IFN-positive CAFs in addition to the neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody. 995 modulated genes and corresponding clustering are displayed. (B) The 19 transcripts that are significantly different between the second condition and both the first and third conditions are magnified. S100A2 (red arrow) is highlighted. (C)S100A2\u2019s differential mRNA expression was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR. An ANOVA analysis followed by a Bonferonni multiple comparison test was performed to show that S100A2 expression rose when the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody was added to the IFN-positive co-culture. (D) The Kaplan Meir analysis on the NKI295 cohort when S100A2 expression is low (left) shows that IFN-positive patients (red) have a significantly shorter survival duration when compared to IFN-negative (blue) patients. Conversely, when S100A2 expression is high (plot on right), the IFN-positive and negative groups have statistically indistinguishable survival profiles.In order to gain a greater understanding of the molecular mediator(s) of the pro-proliferative effects of the IFN-positive CAFs, we carried out gene expression profiling of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line under various co-culture and mono-culture conditions. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was grown alone or co-cultured with the IFN-positive CAFs T38 and T44, in the presence of IgG1 or neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies for 72\u00a0hours at which point RNA was harvested from the breast cancer cell line. We carried out a supervised clustering approach comparing three different groups of samples in a 2x2x2 study design; MCF-7 breast cancer cell line with IgG1 isotype control antibody, MCF-7 co-cultured with the two IFN-positive CAFs and the IgG1 antibody and lastly, MCF-7 co-cultured with the two IFN-positive CAFs and treated with the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody. There were a total of 995 differentially expressed genes when a false discovery rate of 5% was applied to the SAM analysis (Figure\u00a05A). Notably, the overwhelming majority of differentially expressed genes were between mono-culture and co-culture conditions. There was however a group of genes that was significantly down-regulated under co-culture conditions but reverted back to higher expression levels when the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody was added to the co-culture. This group consisted of 19 transcripts of which 12 were annotated genes. Given that the lower expression of these genes correlated with the pro-growth phenotype (Figures\u00a04 and 5A) we reasoned that any putative effector gene in this cluster should function in a tumor-suppressor-like manner if it is to modulate the phenotype we observed. One of these genes , S100A2, had already been identified as a putative tumor suppressor in breast as well as in other types of cancers. These microarray finds were confirmed by way of Q-RT-PCR (Figure\u00a05C). We then interrogated the NKI295 database in order to evaluate the S100A2 gene as a univariate predictor; there was no correlation between outcome and expression levels (data not shown). Next, we separated the entire cohort into the respective high and low expressers of S100A2 according to the median values of S100A2 expression, and recalculated the Kaplan-Meir curves based on our interferon signature. In the low S100A2 group (Figure\u00a05D, left), the high and low IFN expressers were split precisely in half (n\u2009=\u200988 in each group), with the high expressers of the IFN signature showing a poorer prognostic outcome as compared to the low expressers (HR\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20090.023), consistent with our previous analyses. However, when S100A2 was relatively overexpressed this poor outcome associated with the interferon response was not observed, with the high and low expressers of the interferon signature showing a statistically indistinguishable survival outcome (Figure\u00a05D, right). In addition, regarding the molecular subtypes of breast cancers in the NKI295 database, the basal and HER2 positive subtypes carry a significantly increased proportion of IFN positive patients versus the other three classical subtypes (chi squared\u2009=\u200982.8539, df\u2009=\u20094, p-value\u2009<\u20092.2e-16). Interestingly, even after segregating the cohort based on IFN status, which enriches for HER2 and basal poor outcome patients, S100A2 status is still able to demonstrate survival differences in the cohort (Figure\u00a05D). Additional file 4: Figure S4 shows the overlap in molecular subtype, IFN status and S100A2 status in the NKI295 cohort. These above analyses are consistent with our in vitro findings (Figure\u00a05A and B) suggesting that lower S100A2 expression is associated with the pro-tumorigenic effects of the type one interferon response within the breast cancer microenvironment.DiscussionThe tumor microenvironment has been recognized as a major player in the development and progression of solid tumors, including breast cancer. Recently, targeting immune cells within the tumor microenvironment has led to spectacular successes in the treatment of melanomas. The role of interferons in modulating the immune response to viruses is well known, but the role of interferons in modulating the immune response to tumors is less well defined. Early experimental models have uncovered potent direct cytotoxic and/or anti-proliferative effects of interferons, although the translation of these findings into their use as anti-cancer therapeutics has been met with only limited success in breast cancer and other carcinomas. In fact, there were even early indications that the administration of IFN-\u03b2 to cancer patients could lead to an increase in the number of hormone receptors in the cancerous tissue. More recently, the presence of aberrantly expressed IFN-related genes in cancer were first noticed in the initial molecular portraits of breast cancer. Later an IFN signature was observed in several human cancers; 15% of childhood lymphoblastic leukemias, 20% of ovarian and 40% of breast cancers were positive for an IFN-related signature.In the current study we have shown that a subset of breast CAFs (5 of 23 tested CAFs) strongly expresses a type one interferon response and that this response, chiefly through the IFN-\u03b2 cytokine, can impart a pro-proliferative effect on MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro. It should be noted that direct fibroblast-breast cancer cell line contact was necessary when the interferon response was previously induced artificially in vitro. We show that an interferon response is identifiable even after ex-vivo culturing in some CAFs grown alone, and that its pro-proliferative effect on co-cultured breast cancer cells is mediated through the action of soluble IFN-\u03b2 ligand. Our IFN response can be detected in whole breast tumors as an expression signature conveying poor prognosis. Additionally, we showed that S100A2 is a candidate mediator of the IFN response\u2019s effect on patient outcome. S100A2 is a calcium binding protein that has been repeatedly shown to be down regulated in a variety of cancers such as breast, and prostate and is considered to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene.In light of recent findings that interferon positivity correlates with a poor clinical outcome in breast cancer, it is probable that interferons may actually be pro-tumorigenic, as suggested also by our findings. Type one interferon signaling has also been correlated with resistance to doxorubicin and topoisomerase-II inhibitors in vitro and confer resistance to DNA damage in cancer cell lines. Taken together, this would suggest that type one interferon neutralization within the tumor microenvironment should be pursued in lieu of their supplementation at least in cases in which interferon signalling is active and detectable in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, on close inspection of the interferon response gene set we have identified there are many cytokines present (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL6, IL8, CSF2, CCL11), any one of which could be mediating the phenotype seen herein.ConclusionWe have identified a subset of CAFs and perhaps breast tumors, which may be particularly vulnerable to such therapeutic approaches. These data will need to be further expanded to include in vivo models of human CAFs co-implanted with breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of the potential value of targeted anti-IFN-\u03b2 therapy in breast cancer patients whose tumors show a gene expression profile reflecting a type-one IFN response. Protein biomarkers such as S100A2, OAS2 and/or IFN\u03b2 RNA expression in breast tumors may prove to be useful guides in predicting the response of IFN-positive patients to anti-interferon therapeutics.Additional filesCompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors\u2019 contributionsANH: Conceived this study, designed and carried out experiments, analysed data and wrote the manuscript.

Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.IntroductionThe cooperative interactions among tumor cells and reactive stroma strongly contribute to cancer development and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been indicated as the main cellular component of the tumor microenvironment involved in cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. In breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics through multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of new blood vessels, mainly generated by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Indeed, mechanisms of cell sensing and adaptation to stressful environments are activated within the hypoxic tumor mass, leading to the growth and aggressiveness of malignant cells. The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) primarily mediates the cell responses to a low oxygen tension playing a crucial role in cancer development. In particular, HIF-1 activates a signaling transduction network which drives the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of the hypoxia-inducible \u03b1 subunit and the constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 dimerize upon exposure to hypoxia, generating a complex which binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of target genes. In this regard, it has been shown that HIF-1 is a leading regulator of tumor angiogenesis following hypoxia, as it regulates the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors, like the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Recently, we discovered a further HIF-1-regulated gene, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), which contributes to the adaptation to a low oxygen environment in breast cancer cells and in cardiomyocytes. In particular, we found that the cooperation between GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 upon exposure to hypoxia leads to the up-regulation of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which is a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER. Surprisingly, we also assessed that in CAFs derived from breast cancer malignancies GPER acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. On the basis of these data, GPER-mediated functions may be included among the mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment.Considering that hypoxia regulates HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of both GPER and VEGF in different model systems, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential involvement of GPER in the expression and function of VEGF in CAFs and breast cancer cells. In this regard, we demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates the up-regulation of VEGF as well as the endothelial tube formation, suggesting that this transduction pathway may be involved in the intricate stimulatory responses to hypoxia within the cancer stroma. Our data may open new perspectives towards innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the breast cancer microenvironment.Materials and methodsReagentsCobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Srl (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) was obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). Human CTGF was purchased from MBL International Corporation, distributed by Eppendorf, (Milan, Italy). Human VEGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC, CTGF and VEGF, which were solubilized in water.Ethics statementAll procedures conformed to the Helsinki Declaration for the research on humans. The experimental research has been performed with the ethical approval provided by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital in Cosenza, Italy.Cell culturesThe SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The murine cardiomyocyte-like cell line HL-1 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA). In particular, the HL-1 cell line was established from a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor excised from an adult female Jackson Laboratory-inbred C57BLy6J mouse (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). HL-1 cells were cultured according to the published protocol in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Bioscience, Sigma-Aldrich Srl), 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 0.1 mM norepinephrine (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). All cell lines were grown in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were treated with CoCl2 or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) in a HeraCell incubator (ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy). Cells were switched to medium without serum the day before experiments.Isolation, cultivation and characterization of CAFsCAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies as previously described. Signed informed consent from all the patients and IRB approval were obtained. In particular, tissues obtained were cut into smaller pieces (1 to 2 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for two minutes. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485 \u00d7 g for eight minutes, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham's F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) and cultured at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. In each patient, a second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. We used CAFs and fibroblasts passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. Primary cells cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001), all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy). In order to assess fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All experiments were performed in each CAF population obtained from six patients. Data presented were obtained in CAFs derived from one patient; however, results similar to those shown were found in CAFs derived from the other five patients.Gene reporter assaysThe 2.6 kb VEGF promoter-luciferase construct containing full-length VEGF promoter sequence (22,361 to +298 bp relative to the transcription start site) used in luciferase assays was a kind gift from Dr. Pal Soumitro (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). CAFs or SkBr3 cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u03bcL/well culture medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 h with control shRNA, shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER. Next, a mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was transfected within cells. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). After 8 h, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed to low oxygen (2% O2) for 12 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) normalized to the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as one-fold induction, from which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.Gene expression studiesTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not degraded and showed clear 18S and 28S bands under ultraviolet light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected genes was quantified by both real-time RT-PCR using Step One\u00ae sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Milan, Italy) and semiquantitative RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and are as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'-TGCATCTCCATCTTCTACCCAAGT-3' and Rev: 5'-CCGACTGTGAGTGCCACTGT-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'-ACACACCTGGGTGGACACAA-3' and Rev: 5'-GGAGCCAGAAGCCACATCTG-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ACCTGTGGGATGGGCATCT-3' and Rev: 5'-CAGGCGGCTCTGCTTCTCTA-3'; VEGF (human): Fwd: 5'- TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-3' and Rev: 5'- TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'- GGAGATCCTTCGAGGAGCACTT-3' and Rev: 5'- GGCGATTTA GCAGCAGATATAAGAA-3'; 18S (human, mouse) Fwd: 5'-GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-3' and Rev: 5'- GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT -3. The ribosomal protein 18S was used as a control gene to obtain normalized values.For semiquantitative PCR, primers were as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'- GCTGATTTGTGAACCCAT TC-3' and Rev: 5'- CTGTACTGTCCTGTGGTGAC-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'- CTGGGGAGTTTCCTG TCTGA -3' and Rev: 5'-GCTTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ATGGCATGAAGCCAGAGAGT-3' and Rev: 3'-GGTCAGTGAGCACGCTAAAA-3'; VEGF (human) Fwd: 5'-GAGCTTCAGGACATTGCTGT-3' and Rev: 5'-AGGAAGGTCAACCACTCACA-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3' and Rev: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3'; 36B4 (human) Fwd: 5'-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3' and Rev: 5'-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3'; GAPDH (mouse) Fwd: 5'-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3' and Rev: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'. 36B4 and GAPDH were used as control genes to obtain normalized values.Western blot analysisTo prepare lysates, CAFs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 50 mM Hepes solution, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to the Bradford method. Cell lysates (10 to 50 \u03bcg of protein) were electrophoresed through a reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary polyclonal IgG antibody for HIF-1\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Celbio, Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), CTGF (L-20), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), \u03b2-actin (C2), b-tubulin (H-235-2) and appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA). The levels of proteins and phosphoproteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and revealed using the ECL\u00ae System (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).Gene silencing experimentsCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected for 24 h before treatments with a control vector or an independent shRNA sequence for each target gene using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics). The shRNA plasmid for HIF-1\u03b1 and the respective control plasmids were purchased from SABioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA). The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by the construct which we have previously described and used.Immunofluorescence microscopyFifty percent confluent cultured CAFs, SkBr3 and HL-1 cells grown on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed for 12 h to low oxygen tension (2% O2). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments, cells were previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids (as described above) and then treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, or cultured under hypoxia as indicated. Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging System supported by quantification and image processing software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (Leica Microsystems CMS, GbH Mannheim, Germany) were used for experiment evaluation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCAFs were grown in 10-cm dishes to 60 to 70% confluence, serum deprived for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, USA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primer for the -1,216 to -883 region of the human VEGF promoter containing the HRE site is 5'-CACAGACCTTCACAGCCATC-3' (forward hHRE) and 5'-CCCAGCGTAGACAGTTGAGT-3' (reverse hHRE). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation. For knockdown experiments CAFs were previously transfected in serum-free medium for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and the respective control shRNA (as described above) and then treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2.Migration assayMigration assays were performed with CAFs in triplicate using Boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8 mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich Srl). CAFs were transfected with shRNA constructs directed against HIF-1\u03b1, GPER or with an unrelated control shRNA construct in regular growth medium. After 24 h, cells were exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 6 h in medium without serum. Then, cells were maintained for 24 h in normoxic conditions (20% O2) in medium without serum. This experimental condition has been designed in order to reproduce the unbalanced oxygenation occurring within solid tumors, where the irregular blood flow is responsible for hypoxia and reoxygenation phases. CAFs were, therefore, trypsinized and seeded in the upper chambers. CTGF (100 ng/mL) was added to the medium without serum in the bottom wells where applicable. Six hours after seeding, cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed and counted.Conditioned mediumCAFs were cultured in regular growth medium to 80% confluence. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with shHIF-1\u03b1, shGPER or control shRNA using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions for 12 h. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in HUVECs.Protein precipitation with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)Conditioned medium from CAFs (see above) was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and 10 \u03bcg/mL BSA (final concentration) was added as a control for precipitation efficiency. TCA (100% solution) was added to a final concentration of 20% to conditioned media. After a 20-minute incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 31,000 g for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C). Pellets were washed with cold acetone, centrifuged at 31,000 g for 30 minutes (4\u00b0C), air dried and resuspended in protein lysis buffer (described above). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford Method and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using 100 \u03bcg protein/lane.Tube formation assayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37\u00b0C in serum free medium (EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen, Inc., Helgerman Court, Gaithersburg, USA) was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates and left at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Invitrogen), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel\u00ae and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls' testing to determine differences in means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsHypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression in CAFsIn order to provide further insight into the response to hypoxia in main components of the tumor microenvironment like CAFs, we began our study showing that hypoxia induces the mRNA expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene GPER, as ascertained by real time PCR (Figure 1) and semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). In particular, CAFs were treated from 1 h to 24 h with the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2 (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 1a) or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1b). The induction of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mRNA expression was paralleled by increased protein levels of these factors in CAFs treated from 1 h to 24 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 1c) or exposed to a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1d). Next, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the induction of GPER by CoCl2 was abrogated (Figure 1e, Additional file 1a), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in CAFs exposed to hypoxic conditions. In order to assess the transduction signaling involved in the aforementioned responses, we determined the rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation (from 15 minutes up to 60 minutes) following the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 2a). Accordingly, we observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation culturing CAFs in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (Figure 2b). Next, the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 30 minutes in the presence of 300 \u03bcM of the ROS scavenger NAC did not induce the ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). Moreover, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER observed treating CAFs for 3 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 was no longer evident in the presence of 300 \u03bcM NAC and 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor PD (Figure 2d). On the basis of these results, it could be argued that hypoxia-induced ROS may trigger the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is involved in the up-regulation of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression.Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs. (a-d) The exposure to 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a, c) or low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 3 h) (b, d) up-regulate the mRNA (a, b) and protein (c, d) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER as evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In RNA experiments, values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. (e) The up-regulation of GPER observed treating CAFs for 6 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. Side panel shows densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.Hypoxia stimulates the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER through ERK1/2 activation in CAFs. The treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a) or the exposure to low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (b) induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is prevented by using 300 \u03bcM of the free radical scavenger NAC (c). (d) Immunoblots of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER from CAFs treated for 3 h with vehicle (-) or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 alone and in combination with 300 \u03bcM NAC or 10 \u03bcM ERK1/2 inhibitor PD. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to ERK/2 or \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cultured under normoxia vs cells treated with CoCl2 or cells cultured under hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the expression of VEGF induced by hypoxiaConsidering the ability of a low oxygen environment to trigger the production of pro-angiogenic factors in solid tumors, we aimed to evaluate whether hypoxia may promote the expression of an important HIF-1\u03b1 target gene like VEGF. As shown in Figure 3a, the treatment with CoCl2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF in a time-dependent manner in both CAFs and SkBr3 breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in a completely different model system, such as HL-1 cardiomyocytes (Additional file 2). Next, CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) activated a VEGF promoter reporter gene which was transfected in CAFs and SkBr3 cells (Figure 3b, c). Notably, the aforementioned transcriptional response to hypoxia was abrogated knocking-down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 3d, e and Additional file 1c, d). CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) promoted also VEGF protein expression in CAFs, as evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4). The induction of VEGF protein levels was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 5 and Additional file 1a, b), further highlighting their involvement in the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia. Analogously, the up-regulation of VEGF protein expression upon exposure to hypoxia in SkBr3 (Figure 6a) and HL-1 cells (Figure 7a) was no longer evident, knocking down the expression of GPER (Figures 6b and 7b and Additional file 1e) and HIF-1 \u03b1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the regulation of VEGF expression induced by hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF. (a) The mRNA expression of VEGF is up-regulated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as evaluated by real-time PCR. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle (-). Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. (b) The VEGF promoter plasmid (pVEGF) is transactivated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 12 h (b) or exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) for 12 h (c). The transactivation of the VEGF promoter observed in SkBr3 cells treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER expression (e). The luciferase activities were normalized to the internal transfection control and values of cells receiving vehicle or cultured under normoxia were set as one-fold induction upon which the activities induced by CoCl2 treatment or hypoxia were calculated. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Interestingly, GPER was required for the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of VEGF, as evidenced knocking-down the expression of GPER (Figure 8c). In parallel, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the recruitment of GPER to the HRE site within the VEGF promoter sequence (Figure 8d). Altogether, these findings suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER leads to the hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence. CAFs treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 were submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (a) or anti-GPER (b) antibodies. For knockdown experiments, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPER (c) or with control shRNA and shHIF-1\u03b1 (d), treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 and then submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (c) or anti-GPER (d) antibodies. The amplified sequences were evaluated by real-time PCR. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle vs CoCl2 treatment.On the basis of these data, we then examined whether conditioned medium from hypoxia-stimulated CAFs could promote in HUVECs the formation of tubule-like structures that represent a useful model system for the evaluation of the neoangiogenesis process. In particular, HUVECs were cultured on GFR-Matrigel\u00ae-coated plates which prevent the formation of capillary-like structures, as previously reported. Notably, HUVECs cultured in normoxic medium from CAFs did not assemble into cord-like structures, while HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs maintained in hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h) displayed a complex ramified network of tubules (Figure 9a). Moreover, in HUVECs cultured with hypoxic medium (2% O2 for 12 h) collected from CAFs, which were previously transfected with a shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER, tube formation was no longer observed (Figure 9b, c). The addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF to the hypoxic medium from GPER-silenced CAFs restored the ability to form tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure 9c). The aforementioned findings were quantified and recapitulated in Additional file 3. Next, we determined that the up-regulation of VEGF protein levels in hypoxic medium from CAFs is no longer evident, knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Additional file 4). Hence, these results clearly suggest that VEGF may be considered as a target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced tube formation. Tube formation was evaluated in HUVECs cultured for 2 h in medium collected from CAFs which were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). To this end, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA (a), shHIF-1\u03b1 (b) or shGPER (c) and exposed to hypoxia, as indicated. Tube formation is rescued in HUVECs treated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and cultured in medium from CAFs transfected with shGPER and cultured under hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). Data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFsIn order to further corroborate the stimulatory role exerted by HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in hypoxic conditions, we turned to a different model system. CoCl2 and low oxygen tension (2% O2) induced CTGF up-regulation at both mRNA (Figure 10a) and protein level (Figure 10b, c) in CAFs. Silencing HIF-1\u03b1 as well as knocking down GPER expression, the up-regulation of CTGF upon CoCl2 was abolished (Figure 10d, e). As a biological counterpart, the migration of CAFs cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2) was prevented, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression and rescued, adding CTGF (Figure 10f). Collectively, our data may suggest that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates different biological outcomes in CAFs exposed to hypoxia.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFs. (a) The mRNA expression of CTGF is induced after the stimulation of CAFs with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as indicated. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. The protein expression of CTGF is induced by 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (b) or low oxygen tension (2% O2, for 4 h) (c). The up-regulation of CTGF protein expression observed upon 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 treatment is abrogated silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER (e) expression. The migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) is prevented knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression. Cell migration is rescued in CAFs transfected with shGPER, exposed to hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) and treated with 100 ng/ml CTGF (f). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.DiscussionIn the present study, we provide novel evidence regarding the regulation of VEGF, which plays a fundamental role in mediating hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In particular, our results demonstrate that a low oxygen tension stimulates through the ERK1/2 transduction pathway the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent expression of GPER, which contributes to the regulation of VEGF in both CAFs and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that following hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter region and cooperatively act as a functional complex for the transcription of VEGF. As a biological counterpart, we evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mediate endothelial tube formation in HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs which were previously exposed to hypoxia. Further corroborating these findings, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER regulates the expression of the migratory factor CTGF, which has been acknowledged as a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.HIF-1 is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and acts as a survival factor in hypoxic tumor environment, mainly activating the transcription of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, oxygen consumption, cell migration and invasion. Besides, hypoxia stimulates through HIF-1 the expression of anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic factors that drastically change the biological properties of tumor cells towards malignant features. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that GPER may be included among the HIF-1 target genes as the up-regulation of GPER induced by hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in breast cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. In particular, GPER-mediated the antiapoptotic effects exerted by estrogens in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the adaptation of cancer cells to a low oxygen environment.GPER may be considered as a predictor of cancer malignancy and aggressiveness considering that its expression has been associated with negative clinical features and poor survival rates in diverse types of tumors. Therefore, huge efforts are currently underway to unravel the mechanisms that rule its regulation and function. Indeed, the development and characterization of drugs that target key players of cancer progression like GPCRs, and particularly GPER, are currently innovative topics under investigation.In this context, estrogenic GPER signaling has been shown to trigger relevant biological effects like proliferation and migration in diverse cancer cells and in CAFs derived from breast tumors. Notably, GPER exhibited the peculiar property to act in CAFs as a transcriptional regulator together with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hence leading to the up-regulation of Cyclin D, which has been largely involved in cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has suggested that CAFs may drive cancer phenotype mainly through a paracrine action exerted by the production of various growth factors and chemokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the stromal contribution to the development of a wide variety of tumors has been supported by animal models of cancer pathogenesis and extensive clinical studies. In this vein, it has been shown that malignant cells recruit into the tumor mass diverse stromal components like CAFs, inflammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate towards cancer progression. In particular, CAFs elicit in breast carcinomas relevant biological activities, including the stimulation of new blood vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth, metastasis and poor prognosis. In this context, our present data add a further mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment may promote angiogenesis, as the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling was shown to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Considering that VEGF is one of the most important factors mediating the complex process of angiogenesis, its action has been widely involved in the development of many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been shown that the ectopic expression of VEGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may promote tumor growth in vivo , whereas the blockade of VEGF has been associated with the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude mice. Thus, given the crucial role exerted by VEGF in tumor development and prognosis, a great deal of interest is currently addressed to a better understanding of its regulation and function. In this regard, VEGF was shown to be regulated by hypoxia mainly through HIF-1\u03b1, which may interact with numerous factors to boost VEGF expression. Further extending the current knowledge on the complex regulation of VEGF, our data suggest that GPER may contribute to the HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional responses in hypoxic tumor microenvironment towards new blood vessel formation. Notably, an increased VEGF production was recently shown to parallel an elevated GPER expression in endometrial cancer patients with low survival rates. These data in combination with our findings may suggest that in estrogen-dependent cancer cells diverse molecular mechanisms could converge on the production of cytokines and growth factors, promoting an enhancement of malignant epithelial growth and invasion through autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Interestingly, we have determined that the up-regulation of VEGF relied on HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling also in HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this transduction mechanism may be implicated in additional pathophysiological conditions, such as the hypoxic myocardium. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective role exerted by GPER in stressful conditions following hypoxia. These data in combination with the results obtained in the present study may indicate that GPER could elicit cardiotropic effects also through its ability to regulate the expression of VEGF, which mainly contributes to adaptive responses following myocardial ischemic injury.As it concerns the signaling cascades activated by hypoxia, we here demonstrate that the ROS-mediated ERK1/2 activation is involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression upon low oxygen tension. In this regard, it should be mentioned that ROS play a relevant role in the biological responses to re-oxygenation; however, decreased oxygen levels may be sufficient to trigger HIF-1-dependent gene expression through the ROS production. In addition, the rapid responses to hypoxia are mediated by multiple transduction pathways activated also upon GPER stimulation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the functional cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER, particularly following both hypoxic and estrogenic stimulations. For instance, estrogens regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression and function in a stressful environment, indicating an intricate cooperation between these two main factors mainly involved in tumor progression. Interestingly, in the current investigation, the biological interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER upon hypoxic conditions was corroborated by the up-regulation of an important migratory stimulator and GPER target gene like CTGF. Accordingly, the migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression, hence confirming their contribution to this relevant cell response.The results obtained in the current study may also disclose a unique ligand-independent action elicited by GPER. This issue could be a further attractive topic which remains to be elucidated in future studies.Altogether, our findings recapitulate in CAFs exposed to hypoxia the engagement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling towards the regulation of pivotal genes involved in angiogenic and metastatic processes. Anyway, further studies are required to better define the role exerted by this transduction pathway in diverse pathophysiological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia through the functional interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.ConclusionsWithin the tumor microenvironment exposed to hypoxia, CAFs have been involved in the generation of new blood vessels which mainly support cancer progression. Our current data highlight the stimulatory role exerted by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the multistep process of tumor neoangiogenesis fostered by CAFs. Considering the crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma, the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway may be pointed out as a further biological target towards innovative treatments in breast cancer.AbbreviationsCAFs: Carcinoma activated fibroblasts; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; DAPI: 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EGM: endothelial growth medium; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAP\u03b1: fibroblast activated protein \u03b1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GPER: G-Protein estrogen receptor; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; HREs: hypoxia-responsive elements; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TCA: trichloroacetic acid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEMDF designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the paper.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features.

The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.  Biglycan correlates biological features and clinical outcomesThe correlation between BGN and immune features. a, Heatmap showing the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes. b, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and ESTIMATE stromal and immune scores. c, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and CIBERSORT-derived immune cell scores. Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

        "title": "Interactions with fibroblasts are distinct in Basal-like and luminal breast cancers.",
        "content": "Basal-like breast cancers have several well-characterized distinguishing molecular features, but most of these are features of the cancer cells themselves. The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of basal-like breast cancer, we performed cocultures of several basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these with cocultures of luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL3, and TGF\u03b2.

The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of Basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of Basal-like breast cancer we performed cocultures of several Basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these to cocultures of Luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between Basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL3, and TGFbeta. Under the influence of fibroblasts, Basal-like breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro. Migration was less pronounced for Luminal lines, but these lines were more likely to have altered proliferation. These differences were relevant to tumor biology in vivo, as the gene set that distinguished Luminal and Basal-like stromal interactions in coculture also distinguishes Basal-like from Luminal tumors with 98% accuracy in 10-fold CV and 100% accuracy in an independent test set. However, comparisons between cocultures where cells were in direct contact and cocultures where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct cell-to-cell contact. The phenotypes and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with fibroblasts support the microenvironment and cell-cell interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer subtypes.INTRODUCTIONThe heterogeneity of human breast tumors is well established, with Basal-like breast cancer (BBC) widely recognized as a particularly aggressive subtype of disease. Several molecular features that distinguish Basal-like breast cancers from other breast cancer subtypes have been identified including higher rates of p53 mutations, BRCA1 mutations and methylation, EGFR-RAS-MEK pathway defects, and retinoblastoma (RB1) LOH. These molecular defects are characteristics of the cancer cells themselves. However, higher local recurrence rates for BBC relative to other breast cancer subtypes suggests that these tumors may also be characterized by field defects arising either from epithelium, stroma, or from altered stroma-epithelium interactions.The importance of stroma-epithelial interactions is well established [reviewed in Bissell and Radisky ]. Stroma plays a critical role in epithelial proliferation and organization through production of extracellular matrix, paracrine signaling and direct cell contact. Fibroblasts are a major component of the stroma and their numbers are greatly enriched in tumors. These cancer-associated fibroblasts also are qualitatively different than normal fibroblasts and can facilitate the progression of cancer. Some studies have suggested that normal fibroblasts may inhibit breast cancer, but other work by Wadlow et al. demonstrated that the phenotypic effects of stroma-epithelial interaction vary widely across a panel of cancer cell lines and fibroblasts derived from different anatomic sites. Gene expression lists reflective of stromal-epithelial interactions in breast cancer have previously been obtained using a variety systems (i.e. fibroblasts responding to serum, fibroblast-epithelial cocultures, microdissected tumor stroma and adjacent normal stroma, desmoid-type fibromatosis and solitary fibrous tumors to identify stromal reaction patterns, and endothelial-epithelial cocultures). Many of these stromal signatures, when evaluated in tumor microarray datasets, show prognostic value and correlate with tumor subtype. However, as recognized by a recent panel convened to identify gaps in breast cancer research, \u201cthe stroma-derived signals are poorly understood, as is the reciprocal communication between epithelium and stroma\u201d.We hypothesized that Basal-like and Luminal breast cancers have distinct and characteristic interactions with stroma. We therefore performed cocultures where different breast cancer cell lines were grown in contact with fibroblasts, the predominant stromal cell type in breast tissue. The relevance of the observed gene expression changes from coculture were tested in vivo by evaluating the expression of these genes in patient samples. These results establish a model system for studying the molecular dynamics that govern stroma-cancer cell interactions and document novel and important interactions between Basal-like and Luminal cancers and their microenvironments.METHODSCell linesSKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in ATCC-recommended media and conditions. MDA-MB-231 was from ATCC and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 50 units per mL penicillin and 50 units/mL streptomycin. SUM102, SUM149, SUM159 cells were a gift from Steve Ethier of the Karmanos Cancer Center at Wayne State University. SUM102 was maintained in HuMEC (Invitrogen). SUM149 and SUM159 were maintained in Ham\u2019s F-12 (GIBCO) supplemented with 5% FBS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin, 1 \u03bcg/mL hydrocotisone, 5 \u03bcg/mL Gentamycin (GIBCO/Invitrogen) 0.5 \u03bcg/ml Amphotericin B (Sigma). MCF7, ZR-75-1, ME16C were procured and cultured as described previously. T47D, HCC1937, and RMF (htert-immortalized fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasty,) were maintained in RPMI1640 with L-glutamine (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 50U/mL penicillin and 50 units/mL streptomycin (GIBCO). SKBR3 was maintained in McCoy\u2019s 5 (Cellgro [http://www.cellgro.com/]) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 50U/mL penicillin and 50U/mL streptomycin (GIBCO). All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tissue Culture Facility. Cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide, except where ATCC protocols suggested ambient carbon dioxide (MDA-MB-231 only). Cultures were two-dimensional, grown on plastic.Coculture ConditionsCancer cell lines and fibroblasts cells were grown in the appropriate cancer cell media (e.g. MCF-7 in RPMI) for the duration of the 48 hour coculture studies, after performing growth curves to ascertain that the RMFs maintained doubling times in each media similar to the doubling times observed in RPMI1640. Two types of cocultures were performed. First, we refer to direct cocultures, defined as a coculture where the two cell types are grown in physical contact, in the same well. The following RMF:cancer cell ratios were plated for most direct cocultures: 0:1, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 1:0, and cells were maintained in coculture for 48 hours prior to harvesting cells for RNA isolation. Second, we refer to interaction cultures, defined as a coculture where fibroblasts and cancer cells are grown separated by a membrane, but where they are in contact via soluble factors. Interaction cocultures were plated at a 1:1 ratio in 6 well transwell plates and were maintained in coculture for 48 hours prior to harvesting cells for RNA isolation. These studies were performed by seeding one of the two cell types in the insert layer of Corning Transwell plates with 0.4 \u03bcm pore polycarbonate membranes while the other cell type was grown in the bottom well.Cell Based AssaysMTT cell proliferation assays (Promega) were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol in the bottom well of transwell plates with an 0.4 \u03bcm pore polycarbonate membrane after 48 hours of exposure to fibroblasts grown in the upper insert. The following RMF:cancer cell ratios were plated for 48 hours in 96-well interaction cocultures: 0:1, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 1:0. Sixteen wells were performed per condition and triplicates experiments were performed. Absorbance at 570 nm minus absorbance at 490 nm was measured on an EL800 BioTek plate reader. Percent change in absorbance relative to control was calculated as the sample absorbance divided by the average absorbance of the control without fibroblasts, multiplied by 100.Migration assays were performed using a 6-well transwell plate with an 8 \u03bcm pore polycarbonate membrane. The bottom well contained 2\u00d7105 fibroblasts or media alone and cultures were maintained for 48 hours. The insert was then seeded with 1\u00d7105 cancer cells and cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 6 hours. The chamber was disassembled and membranes were fixed in 10% formalin for 5 minutes. The membranes were rinsed in distilled water and then stained in 0.2% crystal violet for 15 minutes, followed by two washing steps in distilled water. The cells on the upper side of the membranes were scraped off and pictures were taken of the cells on the bottom of the membrane with an Olympus IX81 at 10X magnification. Four fields were counted per well using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). All migration assays were replicated 3\u20135 times.Scratch Assays were performed using a 6-well transwell plate with a 4 \u03bcm pore polycarbonate membrane. In the bottom well, 2\u00d7105 Basal-like cells or 5\u00d7105 Luminal cells were plated and allowed to grow for 48 hours with either media or RMF cells plated at a 1:1 ratio in the insert. The chamber was disassembled and a wound was made with a pipette tip. Cells were cultured to allow wound closure for 6 hours, at which time pictures were taken with an Olympus IX81 at 4X and 10X magnifications. Scratch assays were performed in triplicate.RNA and Expression MicroarraysCells were harvested by scraping in RNA lysis buffer. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and RNA quality was analyzed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using an RNA6000 nano chip. Quantification was performed on a ND-1000 Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Microarrays were performed according to Agilent protocol using two-color Agilent 4\u00d744K (Agilent G4112F) human arrays and 244K (Agilent G4502A) custom human arrays. Only probes present on the 4X44K array were utilized and all 4X44K probes were present on the 244K custom array. We used the Agilent Quick Amp labeling kit and protocol to synthesize Cy3-labeled reference from Stratagene Universal Human Reference spiked at 1:1,000 with MCF-7 RNA and 1:1,000 with ME16C RNA to increase expression of breast cancer genes. The identical protocol was applied to total RNA from cocultured or monocultured cell lines to label these samples with Cy5. Labeled cDNAs were hybridized to arrays overnight and washed prior to scanning on an Agilent G2505C microarray scanner. All array data are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSEXXXX, pending).Flow CytometryCell were grown to 80% confluence and dyed with 5 uM of Invitrogen Cell Tracker (Green CMFDA for RMF; Red CMTPX for MCF7 and SUM149 cells). Cells were washed with PBS and grown in media for two hours before plating as monocultures or direct cocultures which were grown for 48 hours as previously described. Cells were trypsinized and kept on ice and sorted on a MoFlo by Beckman. Cells with high green expression were separated as the fibroblast population. RNA was isolated from green and non-green populations as described above.Coculture data normalization and analysisWe selected three Basal-like and three Luminal breast cancer cell lines as a training set for identifying Basal-like specific coculture interactions. The Basal-like and Luminal cell line representatives were selected such that they met both of the following: (1) they were identified as Basal-like or Luminal when all of our monoculture cell line microarray data was median centered and the PAM50 assay was applied, and (2) this classification by PAM50 matched the classification by Neve et al.. The Basal cell lines meeting these criteria were SUM149 and HCC1937 and the Luminal lines were MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and T47D. To select a third Basal-like line, we added SUM102 which is a CK5/6 positive cell line that is Basal-like according to the PAM50 assay but was not assayed by Neve et al. The PAM50 and Neve predictions for each of the 11 cell lines studied in this manuscript are listed in Table 1.Data from 99 microarrays (25 monocultures, 49 direct cocultures, and 25 interaction cocultures representing 11 different cell lines) were included in this study. Only those genes where more than 70% of microarrays had signal in both channels >10 dpi were included. Data were Lowess normalized and missing data were imputed using k-nearest neighbors\u2019 imputation. For the direct coculture analyses, we excluded genes that did not have at least 2-fold deviation from the mean in at least one sample and the method of Buess et al. was used to normalize cocultures to appropriate monocultures performed in the same media and under identical conditions. The Buess method is an example of an expression deconvolution approach applied to coculture data; these methods have been widely used to analyze microarray data, yielding important insights for a variety of problems. This method estimates the percent of fibroblasts and cancer cells in each coculture, followed by calculating a coefficient of interaction for each gene. The percent of fibroblasts and the percent of cancer cells were estimated by computing the percentage of monoculture gene expression from each cell type required to achieve the observed coculture gene expression using equations as described in Buess et al. The most extreme 20% of values for fibroblast percentage were excluded and the remaining 80% were averaged to obtain an estimate of fibroblast content. The percentages of cell types were used to compute the expected gene expression for each gene. The Buess interaction coefficient, I, was then calculated as the ratio of observed to expected gene expression. The estimated I can be thought of as an indicator of the fold-change in a given gene\u2019s expression level relative to the expected level based on the monocultures alone. For interaction cultures, we compared their expression data to the matching monocultures performed under the same conditions and computed the interaction fold change (FC) for all genes. The I-matrix as well as the interaction FC across all samples and genes was analyzed using Significance of Microarrays (SAM) and Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM).Buess interaction coefficients were computed and used to perform a two-class, unpaired SAM analysis comparing cocultures in which fibroblasts and Basal-like (SUM102, SUM149, HCC1937) cancer cells were grown together to those in which fibroblasts and Luminal (MCF7, ZR-75-1, T47D) cancer cells were grown together. The same analyses were performed comparing interaction FC for Basal-like to Luminal, examining the expression of the cancer cells and the fibroblasts separately for each interaction coculture. To identify predictive gene sets for distinguishing cell line subtypes based on coculture data, PAM was applied 100 times in ten-fold cross validation to identify the median class-specific predictive accuracy for a given number of genes in the predictor. The number of genes that provided the maximum class-specific predictive accuracy in both classes (Basal-like and Luminal) was selected. This set of genes was then applied to the test set cell lines that had been preprocessed using identical methods, and these gene sets were also applied to tumor data from public datasets. Functional and pathway analyses were done using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Redwood City, California), with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction to identify significant functions and pathways with p-values less than 0.05.Patient microarrays and subtype predictionPublic datasets were analyzed for this study, specifically using data from 295 tumors samples from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI295) and 227 samples from the University of North Carolina (UNC227). In both datasets the PAM50 algorithm was applied as follows: First, to median center the data the largest possible subset of microarrays consisting of 50% ER positive and 50% ER negative tumors was sampled from each dataset. The median was calculated from this group and applied to median center the entire dataset. This median centering method improves comparability across datasets by median centering given similar subtype composition. Second, the PAM50 single sample predictor, with parameters as described in Parker et al., was used to identify subtype. This PAM50 subtype was used for comparison against all culture-derived subtype predictors.To identify a coculture-based subtype predictor, the probes that distinguished Basal-like and Luminal cocultures were filtered to identify genes that were (1) up-regulated in Basal-like cocultures and above the median for at least 60% of the Basal-like tumors or (2) up-regulated in Luminal cocultures and above the median for at least 60% of Luminal tumors. This criterion ensured that only those genes identified in coculture that share the same direction in tumors were included. This gene set was further refined to identify the minimum number of predictive genes that had maximum class-specific predictive accuracy in ten-fold cross validation using PAM. To identify a fibroblast-derived or cancer-cell derived interaction signature we performed the same filtering methods to the interaction culture data representing fibroblast or cancer-cell responses to coculture. Each of these PAM models was trained on a dataset from NKI consisting of 45 Basal and 217 Luminal breast cancers. Genes from the training dataset were applied to identify subtype on the independent test sets described above.RESULTSBasal-like vs. Luminal gene expression in fibroblast coculturesTwo different types of cocultures were employed: direct cocultures where cells are in physical contact and interaction cocultures using transwell plates. Using established methods for identifying gene expression interactions in direct cocultures, we performed two-class Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to identify interactions that were distinct between Basal-like and Luminal cocultures. A total of 1320 probes showed statistical evidence of distinct interaction given a false discovery rate less than 0.001. Among these 1320 probes, we eliminated genes that behaved idiosyncratically in one cell line (rejecting genes that were not uniformly up-regulated in Basal-like or Luminal cell lines) to yield 488 probes representing 369 genes. A hierarchical cluster of these genes, displaying their coculture interaction coefficients, is shown in Figure 1 and the complete list of genes and their interaction coefficients is provided in Supplemental Table 1. In Figure 1, 140 genes are upregulated specifically in Luminal lines compared to Basal-like, and 229 genes are upregulated in Basal-like lines relative to Luminals. This suggests that interactions with fibroblasts are distinct between Basal-like and Luminal cancer cells.To confirm the gene expression changes identified by computational deconvolution in Figure 1, we performed direct cocultures using dye-labeled cells and then separated cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression analysis. Microarrays were performed using RNA from the sorted cells and Table 2 (and Supplemental File 1) illustrates that 94\u201395% of the expression changes identified by deconvolution were observed in either fibroblasts, cancer cells, or both.Several pathways were enriched specifically in Basal-like or Luminal direct cocultures. By Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), Luminal cocultures showed signaling changes in amino acid metabolism, DNA replication, nucleic acid metabolism, and post-translational modification (Supplemental Table 2). Interestingly, many of these categories are those that are upregulated in cellular proliferation. The Basal-like cocultures were enriched for pathways in hepatic fibrosis, activation of IRF, TREM1 signaling, LXR/RXR Activation, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, IL-6 Signaling, p38 MAPK Signaling, LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR Function, and Growth Hormone Signaling (Supplemental Table 3). Thus, enrichment for pathways involved in immune response was observed in Basal-like cocultures. We had previously observed an increased wound response signature in the normal tissue adjacent to breast tumors. Our analyses of cocultures show that this wound response signaling is up-regulated in this model system, with both Basal-like and Luminal cocultures showing altered expression of genes in the 200-probe/130 gene wound response signature. However, consistent with our previous observations in vivo, in coculture different genes appeared to be upregulated in each cancer subtype with CCL2, CSF3, CXCL1, LAMC2 TLR2, TNFRSF6B and TREM1 up-regulated in Basal-likes and CEACAM6, RECK, S100A8 and TMC5 up-regulated in Luminals. Relative to monocultures comparing Basal-like and Luminal cancer cells, cocultures produced a broader range of expression differences. Comparing the expression of the three mono-culture Basal-like cell lines against the three Luminal cell lines using the same methods and FDR thresholds, we found only 10 probes corresponding to 8 genes. These genes were TFF3, PDZK1, KRT19, FLJ12650, EFHD1, CD109, FLJ10134 and MGC34923. Thus fibroblast interactions appeared to enhance the differences between Basal-like and Luminal cancers.Cell proliferation and migration phenotypes for cancer cells in fibroblast coculturesBased on our observation from gene expression that proliferation-related processes were upregulated due to interactions between Luminal cells and fibroblasts, we performed MTT assays to evaluate change in growth rate for Luminal and Basal interaction cocultures. While there was no net difference considering all luminal cell lines as a group (vs. all basal-like cell lines as a group), all three Luminal cell lines showed statistically significant differences in proliferation in coculture, and were more likely to display altered proliferation (Figure 2A). MCF-7 and T47-D increased cell number by 22% (p=1.0\u00d710\u22126) and 14.4% (p=5.0\u00d710\u22127) relative to monocultures. Only the Luminal line ZR-75-1 showed a significant decrease in proliferation (\u22128.7%, p=0.02). Among the Basal-like lines, only one line showed a significant change in proliferation with coculture; the SUM149 cells appeared to increase growth by approximately 15% (p=5.0\u00d710\u221216), while the SUM102 and HCC1937 had non-significant decreased growth rates of 6% and 0.5%, respectively.In contrast, all three Basal-like lines showed increased cellular migration in interaction cocultures. Although these cell lines display migration capacity in monoculture, the number of migratory cells increased substantially when cocultured in a transwell migration assay (Figure 2B). In addition the ability of the Basal-like lines to close a wound was enhanced in the presence of RMF cells (Figure 2C). These results show a functional change in the cellular behavior in response to coculture. These results mirror observations based on gene expression data, where the Basal-like cells showed upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related pathways such as HGF signaling (hepatic fibrosis in Supplemental Table 3), and also upregulated genes like TGFB1 and TWIST.Direct vs. Interaction Coculture DifferencesThe direct cocultures suggested phenotypes that we were able to confirm using interaction cocultures phenotypic assays (MTT and Transwell migration assays), but we hypothesized that there may be differences in the character and strength of the response to coculture depending upon whether the cells were in direct contact or interacting only through soluble factors. Figure 3 shows that few of the genes expressed in direct coculture (Figure 3A) were similarly expressed in interaction cultures [The heatmap in Figure 3B is based on two Basal-like (SUM102, SUM149), and two Luminal breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D)]. Despite the small percentage of genes that showed strong overlap (such as those in Figure 3C), it cannot be excluded that important interactions are mediated through soluble factors, because the interaction cocultures were able to induce the phenotypic effects of increased proliferation and migration. In fact, TWIST, IL6, IL8, CXCL3, and SOD2 are induced in both direct and interaction Basal-like cocultures.SAM analysis of direct cocultures to identify genes differentially expressed in the fibroblasts under the influence of Basal-like vs. Luminal cancer cell lines identified 233 probes that were differentially expressed (with FDR<0.001), and 204 of these probes (representing 152 genes) were consistently expressed across both Basal-like or both Luminal cocultures. Likewise, for cancer cell lines in interaction cultures with fibroblasts, 279 probes (with FDR<0.001) overall and 248 probes (189 genes) uniformly expressed by cell type were identified. Only three genes were common to the fibroblast and cancer cell lists and changed in the same direction in response to coculture: PGK1, MGC21688 and PTX3. Two genes were regulated in opposite directions in fibroblasts and cancer cells (TNFAIP2, ARID5A). The remaining genes were significant in either fibroblasts or cancer cell lines, but not in both. The direct cocultures appear to have a broader transcriptional response, enriched for more Gene Ontology (GO) functions and more signaling pathways than the transwell cultures. But both the direct and interaction coculture gene lists were enriched for common GO terms such as cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, and cell death. The coculture gene list is additionally enriched for cell morphology, cellular development, cell growth and proliferation, and drug metabolism (Supplemental Table 4) as well as signaling pathways such as hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation, role of macrophage, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, antigen presentation pathway, oncostatin M signaling and glucocorticoid receptor signaling (Supplemental Table 5).Independent Validation In Vitro and Subtype Prediction In VivoTo test whether these results were generalizable to other cell line models of breast cancer, we next employed direct cocultures with 5 additional cell lines as a test set. The test set included: SUM159, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, ME16C. Several fibroblast:epithelial ratios were performed for each cell line. Using our training samples and the 369 genes selected by SAM analyses as significantly associated with subtype, we performed 10-fold cross validation with PAM to identify a set of 14 genes that could reliably distinguish Basal-like from Luminal cocultures. We then applied this set of 14 genes, \u201cthe Coculture14\u201d (Supplemental Table 6) to predict the subtype of the test set cocultures. The predicted subtype for each coculture is shown in Table 1. The enrichment for cytokines in the predictive signatures suggests that high expression of cytokines is a key feature in predicting Basal-like-fibroblast interactions.To evaluate whether these genes were differentially expressed in vivo as a function of breast cancer subtype, we used the coculture derived lists to distinguish Basal-like and Luminal cancers. Supplemental Figure 1 shows the heat map of 140 genes from the coculture 369-gene list that passed an interquartile range (IQR) filter (IQR>1.0) across the 295 samples from the NKI. From this supervised cluster, it is evident that Basal-like and Luminal breast cancers differentially express the genes identified in Basal-like vs. Luminal cocultures. The fourteen genes in our Coculture14 predictor derived from the cell lines mapped to the NKI dataset and this gene set showed 91% training accuracy in identifying Basal and Luminal tumors (Table 3), but the class-specific accuracy was low for Basal-like breast cancers. We also rebuilt a second predictor using 105 genes that mapped to the dataset that were concordant between tumor and cell lines as described in Methods. Using this approach we identified a signature of 29 genes, \u201cCoculture29\u201d, (Supplemental Table 6) which had 98% cross-validation accuracy in predicting Basal vs. Luminal subtype, and good class-specific accuracy for both Basal-like and Luminals. Testing this signature on UNC227 [24] gave similar predictive accuracy (Table 3). Interestingly, the HER2 tumors were more likely to be classified as Luminal than Basal-like, suggesting that these tumors share some emergent features with Luminal cancers.Predictive Value of Fibroblast-Derived and Cancer-Cell Derived Gene Lists In VivoHaving established the relevance of the direct coculture signatures in predicting subtype in vivo, gene expression in interaction cultures was used to evaluate the significance of fibroblast-derived and cancer-cell derived gene expression in characterizing tumor subtype. We found that signatures derived from the interaction cocultures had poor predictive accuracy in vivo relative to signatures derived from direct contact. Using 189 genes that were differentially expressed by Basal-like vs. Luminal cells when under the influence of fibroblast-derived soluble factors, a set of 18 epithelial-derived genes (CancerCell18) were identified that had maximum overall (97%) and class-specific accuracy (89\u201399%) in identifying Basal-like and Luminal cancers. However, in testing this gene set, overall accuracy dropped to 90% and Basal-like accuracy dropped to 72%. Likewise, using the 152 genes altered in fibroblasts under the influence of cancer cells, a 30-gene list (Fibroblast30) was identified that had 97% overall accuracy and 84% accuracy in identifying Basal-like tumors. However, testing this signature on a second dataset (UNC227) resulted in only 40% accuracy among Basal-like tumors. The interaction coculture gene sets (Supplemental Table 6) were not as relevant to in vivo subtype as the direct coculture signatures.DISCUSSIONThe microenvironment features that are unique to Basal-like vs. Luminal breast cancer have not been well characterized. Cancers develop and evolve through interaction with the microenvironment and thus the disease ultimately represents molecular features that accommodate both tumor cell and stromal cell characteristics. In other words, the tumor in vivo is more than the sum of its parts and represents the product of reciprocal interactions. The stromal-epithelial interactions may be targetable to slow growth or reduce metastases, so characterizing these interactions has translational relevance. To better understand the stromal cell interactions of breast cancer subtypes, we studied representative cell lines using fibroblast-cancer cell cocultures. Across 11 different cell lines, emphasizing six that were selected a priori as the representatives of Basal-like or Luminal cancers, we identified stromal interactions that distinguish Basal-like and Luminal breast cancers. This signature had a high degree of predictive accuracy (>98%) in distinguishing Basal from Luminal breast tumors in independent data. In fact, the direct coculture signatures (relative to interaction coculture signatures) resulted in predictors with the highest accuracy in predicting tumor subtype. The biological relevance of direct interaction is supported by studies in mouse xenograft models, where co-injection of cancer cells and fibroblasts or injection of cancer cells pre-treated with direct coculture-conditioned media results in tumor growth promotion. This suggests that cell-cell contact in the microenvironment is a fundamental characteristic of breast cancer subtype.Our observations are consistent with the idea that a tumor is more than the sum of its parts. The gene expression signatures we report represent an \u201cemergent\u201d property of breast cancer subtypes, defined as properties that cannot be identified through functional decomposition. By using a computational deconvolution process that preserves cell-cell contact and more closely approximates functional composition in vivo, we were able to identify biological signatures with implications for breast cancer. We confirmed that changes identified by computational deconvolution were also changed in the same direction in physically separated cells. As our result show, even if soluble interactions are preserved, such as in transwell interaction cultures, the gene expression differs markedly from that observed in direct cocultures where cell-cell contact is intact. However, the interaction cultures preserved some important signals involved in migratory phenotypes (e.g. IL6, IL8, etc.) and induced migratory behavior. Thus both systems have applicability for studying different aspects of the heterotypic interactions between cell types.The role of fibroblast-cancer cell interactions in mediating many of the Basal-like pathways we identified had not previously been demonstrated. For example, oncostatin M dysregulation and alterations in hepatic fibrosis-associated genes were significantly altered in Basal-like coculture. Oncostatin M is a proinflammatory mediator that induces transmigration of human neutrophils through endothelium by stimulating expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with oncostatin M has previously been shown to reduce proliferation and induce cellular morphology changes and EGFR expression, the latter of which is known to be a common occurrence in Basal-like breast cancer. Oncostatin M signaling also plays a critical role in differentiation and death of mammary epithelial cells. Thus, this pathway merits further investigation in relation to Basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis, emphasizing the role of cell-cell communication in modulating that pathway. STAT1 is a component of several of the significant pathways and this is noteworthy because this gene and interferon-gamma signaling were previously shown to be dysregulated in fibroblast-breast cancer coculture systems. Thus our results for STAT1 are consistent with previous literature, but also demonstrate that STAT1 alterations vary with subtype. The observed association between high STAT1 protein expression and poor disease specific survival may be due to STAT1 expression acting as a surrogate biomarker for Basal-like breast cancer. Our objective was to identify how patterns of interactions differ between two important breast cancer subtypes. While some of these specific genes and pathways may be targetable, future studies should explore mechanism in greater detail for some of these pathways. However, the patterns we observed show that our coculture studies rediscovered some well-established biology of Basal-like breast cancer, but generated new insights and information regarding the role of stromal cell interactions in these pathways.Basal-like cells respond to stromal interactions in our systems by increasing migration, while Luminal lines more frequently showed altered proliferation. One Basal-like cell line and a representative of the most aggressive, inflammatory breast cancers, SUM149, increased both proliferation and migration. Interestingly, the increased migratory capacity and upregulation of TWIST and TGF-beta, are characteristics consistent with increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in Basal-like breast cancer cells interacting with fibroblasts. The induction of EMT/stem cell phenotypes by stromal interactions have been reported previously in other cancers and merits further investigation in breast cancer. These data also raise the hypothesis that invasive Basal-like breast cancers may progress by distinct microenvironment-mediated cellular mechanisms relative to Luminal cancers. For example, \u201cself-seeding\u201d, wherein circulating tumor cells colonize their tumors of origin and thereby increase their size, has been demonstrated compellingly with mouse xenograft models using the MDA-MB-231 (Basal-like or Basal B) cell line model. This phenomenon was observed in the presence of stroma and many of the pathways that were altered specifically in Basal-like cocultures (e.g. IL-6, IL-8, oncostatin M signaling, and CXCL1) were important mediators of this effect. IL-8, in particular, has previously been associated with estrogen receptor negative cancers and facilitates invasion among cell lines that possess cancer stem cell properties, however, its regulation has largely been studied in monoculture systems. A recent study has shown that regulation of IL-8 may occur through heterotypic signaling involving microRNA 17/20. This suggests that coculture systems may represent important and convenient in vitro models for some of the cellular capabilities (e.g. migration) relevant to self-seeding phenomena. Because the genes involved in self-seeding appear to be upregulated by heterotypic interactions with Basal-like and not Luminal cell lines, this also raises the hypotheses that self-seeding may be characteristic of the more aggressive Basal-like breast cancer subtype. More broadly, these results suggest that targeting cancer cell capabilities other than mitosis, such as migration, may be an important strategy for halting progression of Basal-like breast cancer.Future work should examine HER2-enriched (HER2E) subtype-specific interactions and also interactions between stroma and the emerging Claudin-low subtype of breast cancer. Our results suggest, based on both the SKBR3 coculture predictions and the predictions for HER2E tumors, that HER2E breast cancers may be associated with microenvironment conditions that are more similar to Luminal breast cancer microenvironments. However, a two-class predictor requires that a tumor be made to fit one of these categories, where certain signatures may be unique or unrecognized without explicitly studying this subtype. Likewise, the MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 may share some of the mesenchymal features of Claudin-low breast cancer and so may be a strong model for this subtype. As models for this breast cancer subtype become more well-established, it will be possible to define unique microenvironment characteristics for Claudin-low tumors. It will also be important to study interindividual variation in fibroblasts and how other mesenchymal cell types and endothelial cells interact with cancer cells.Coculture systems serve as convenient in vitro models for studying molecular dynamics governing breast cancer subtype progression. Previously, we have used many of these cell lines to study chemosensitivity with proliferation as our primary endpoint. For drugs that target mitosis, gene expression profiles of drug-treated monocultures have been good predictors of mechanisms and sensitivity. However, as our appreciation for the importance of stem cells, microenvironment, and angiogenesis have grown and as new drugs targeting these pathways develop, novel approaches for understanding mechanism and predicting response will be needed. Coculture models have substantial advantages over monocultures for recapitulating many of the biological dynamics relevant to the mechanisms of action of these drugs. Pairing cocultures, computational deconvolution, and appropriate phenotypic endpoints (e.g. migration or invasion) allows important insights about mechanisms relevant to breast cancer biology and treatment.Supplementary MaterialFigures and TablesBasal-like and Luminal Cocultures Show Distinct Gene Expression ProfilesHierarchical clustering shows 369 genes that were significantly and consistently differentially expressed between Basal and Luminal breast cancer, when interacting with fibroblasts. The heatmap shows the log2(R/G) of the Buess interaction coefficient, so the color represents the fold change relative to monoculture. A complete list of genes and their interaction coefficients across these samples are available in Supplemental Table 1.Basal-like vs. Luminal Differences in Proliferation and Migration in Response to CocultureInteraction cocultures were used to measure proliferation using an MTT assay (A), migration using a Transwell migration assay (B) and wound healing using a scratch assay (C). Relative to monoculture, cocultures induced significant proliferation changes for all three Luminal lines and for one of the three Basal-like lines. Migration and wound healing were more pronounced both at baseline and following coculture for the Basal-like breast cancer cell lines.Gene Expression Differences Observed in Direct Coculture are Not Fully Recapitulated in Interaction (Transwell) CoculturesThis 1-dimensional (genes clustered only) cluster of the 369 genes from coculture included direct (A) and interaction (B) cocultures where either fibroblasts alone (but under the influence of Luminal or Basal-like breast cancer cell lines) or breast cancer cell lines alone (but under the influence of fibroblasts) were used to harvest RNA for microarrays. The color bars along the top indicate which cell type was represented in the microarray: orange indicates fibroblasts, blue indicates Luminal cells, and red indicates Basal-like cells. A small percentage of genes (C) show strong overlap between direct and interaction cocultures.Breast Cancer Cell Lines Cocultured with Reduction Mammoplasty Fibroblasts and their Subtype

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Fibroblasts are the most abundant and active stromal cells, which exhort cancer cells all over the various carcinogenic steps. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-related pro-carcinogenic effects are mediated through paracrine factors, which are under the control of several tumor suppressor genes such as p16 and p53. In addition to their cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function, these proteins possess also non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive effects that they manifest from stromal fibroblasts.CHEK2 is another tumor suppressor gene, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of sporadic tumors and is a low penetrance-predisposing gene to sarcoma, brain tumors and familial breast cancer. The two most studied breast cancer predisposing variants of the CHEK2 gene are the 100delC deletion in the kinase domain in exon 10, and the 470\u00a0T\u2009>\u2009C (I157T) missense mutation in the fork-head-associated (FHA) domain in exon 3. These 2 mutations are associated with approximately 2- fold increased risk of breast cancer. A novel recurrent CHEK2 Y390C mutation has been recently identified in high-risk Chinese breast cancer patients. This mutation impairs CHEK2 activity and is associated with increased breast cancer risk.CHEK2 is a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene that encodes a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase. CHEK2 enables the link between ATM/ATR kinases and downstream checkpoint effectors such as p53 during DNA-damage response. When activated Chk2 phosphorylates various proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, p53 signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, CHEK2 plays also a major role in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Indeed, the expression of several SASP-related cytokines, particularly the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, is under the control of a pathway involving CHEK2. Therefore, in addition to its capital role in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing fixation of potentially carcinogenic mutations, CHEK2 is also involved in regulating cellular communication with its microenvironment. Like senescent cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts have also a secretary phenotype responsible for their procarcinogenic effects. Therefore, we sought to investigate the potential role of CHEK2 in the secretory phenotype of breast stromal fibroblasts and their activation.We have shown that CHEK2 inhibits the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts and has a non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive function through repressing the expression/secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6.MethodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Breast tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center. Signed informed consent was obtained from all the patients under the Research Ethical Committee Project number RAC#2031091. While CAFs derived from tumors, TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2\u00a0cm away from tumors (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of breast cancer tissues was performed after routine examination by certified anatomical pathologist using hematoxilin and eosin (HE)-stained sections. NBF-1 cells were developed from healthy age-matched female who performed breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, in the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). MDA-MB-231and MCF-10A cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were authenticated before purchase by their standard short tandem repeat DNA typing methodology, and were routinely tested for the presence of the relevant markers, and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotics and antimycotics solutions, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in humidified incubator with 5\u00a0% CO2.Anti-SDF-1 (MAB310) and IgG (6-101-C-ABS) from R&D systems; anti-IL-6 (17901) from Sigma, USA. Blocking antibodies were used at 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.RNA purification and quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was purified using the TRI reagent (Sigma) and single stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained from reverse transcription of 1\u00a0\u03bcg of RNA using RT-PCR kit (BD Biosciences) and following the manufacturer protocol. cDNA was then amplified with 1U Taq polymerase, dNTPs (50\u00a0mM), and primers (25 pmol each). For real time RT-PCR Syber green and platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) were used and the amplifications were performed utilizing the Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor Real time PCR detection system. All reactions were performed in triplicates and the data were analyzed using the 2(\u2212Delta Delta C(T)) method.CHEK2: 5\u2032-TGTCCCTCCCAAACCAGTAGTTGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTCACAGCCCCATGGCAGCG-3\u2032IL-6: 5\u2032-GACAAAGCCAGAGTCCTTCAGAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGATCT-3\u2032GAPDH: 5\u2032-GAGTCCACTGGCGTCTTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGT-3\u2032SDF1: 5\u2032-TAGTCAAGTGCGTCCACGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGACACACCACAGCACAAAC-3\u2032The primers are:Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5-1.104/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48\u00a0h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt WST-1 colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The WST-1 reagent was added to each well, and the plates were then incubated for 4\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified using ELISA reader at 450\u00a0nm of absorbance.Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. Antibodies directed against alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), Stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), Twist-1, Vimentin (RV202), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and N-cadherin were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); E-cadherin (24E10), EpCam (UV1D9), Chk2 (2662) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); p53 (DO-1) and Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, FL-335) was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).ELISA assaysSupernatants from 24\u00a0h fibroblast cell cultures were harvested, and ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (R&D Systems). The OD was used at 450-nm on a standard ELISA plate-reader. These experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least twice.Chemotaxis and invasion assayThe 24-well BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers were used as per the manufacturer guideline (BD Bioscience). 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells separated by an 8 \u03bcm pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick stain (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane with Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil, and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification; 40x). Each assay was performed in triplicate.siRNA transfectionCHEK2-siRNA (SIH600921A) was obtained from SABiosciences, and the transfection was performed using lipofectamin (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer.Viral infectionLentivirus based vectors bearing CHEK2-ORF and the control (Origene, RC212127L1) were used to prepare lentiviral supernatant from 293FT cells. Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48\u00a0h post-transfection, filtered and used for infection. 24\u00a0h later, media were replaced with complete medium and cells were grown for 3\u00a0days.Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24\u00a0h, and then medium was collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until needed.Quantification of protein expression levelProtein signal intensity of each band was determined using ImageQuant TL Software (GE Healthcare). Next, dividing the obtained value of each band by the values of the corresponding internal control allowed a correction of the loading differences.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test (two tailed and unpaired) and p-values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant.ResultsCHEK2 is down-regulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts\nCHEK2 expression is down-regulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and 50\u00a0\u03bcg of proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. b Total RNA was extracted from the indicated cells and the amount of the\u00a0CHEK2 mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.DWe started the present study by assessing the level of the Chk2 protein in CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (tumor counterpart fibroblasts) isolated from the same patients. To this end, we prepared whole cell lysates from 12 CAF/TCF pairs, and then we performed immunoblotting analysis using specific Chk2 antibody and GAPDH was used as internal control. Figure\u00a01a shows that while Chk2 was undetectable in both CAF-180 and TCF-180 cells, the level of the protein was reduced in all the other CAFs as compared to their corresponding TCF cells. The level of Chk2 was also very low in TCF-87 and TCF-148 (Fig.\u00a01a). Next, we assessed the expression of the CHEK2 mRNA level in CAFs and their counterpart TCFs. Total RNA from the same 12 CAF/TCF pairs was purified and the CHEK2 mRNA was amplified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using specific primers, and GAPDH was used as internal control. Figure\u00a01b shows that the CHEK2 mRNA level was lower in 11 out of 12 CAFs (92\u00a0%) as compared to their corresponding TCF cells. On the other hand, CHEK2 mRNA level was similar in TCF-900 and CAF-900\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a01b). Therefore, Fig.\u00a01a and b shows that, in general, there is correlation between the mRNA and protein expression levels among the CAF/TCF pairs. For 3 pairs TCF/CAF-118, TCF/CAF-180 and TCF/CAF-900 there was no correlation between the mRNA and protein levels of CHEK2. This shows that CHEK2 is down-regulated in most CAFs as compared to their corresponding TCFs at both the mRNA and protein levels.CHEK2 induces p53 but represses the expression of \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1 and IL-6 in breast stromal fibroblasts\nCHEK2 represses the expression/secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6.\na Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting analysis. The numbers below the bands indicate the corresponding expression levels after loading correction against GAPDH. b Total RNA was extracted from the indicated cells and used to assess the mRNA levels of SDF-1 and IL-1 using qRT-PCR and specific primers. c Conditioned media from the indicated cells were collected after 24\u00a0h and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by ELISA, and were presented in the respective histograms. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D, *, p value\u2009<\u20090.0001After showing the reduced level of CHEK2 in CAFs as compared to their respective TCFs from the same patients, we sought to investigate the potential effect of CHEK2 specific down-regulation on the activation of these cells. To this end, we knocked-down CHEK2 in TCF-169 cells and the obtained results were compared with those of the corresponding CAF-169 cells. Figure\u00a02a shows efficient down-regulation (6 fold) of Chk2 in TCF-169 by CHEK2-siRNA as compared to the corresponding control. This mirrors the expression of Chk2 in TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Interestingly, while the 3 markers \u03b1-SMA, IL-6 and SDF-1 were undetectable in TCF-169 and control-siRNA cells, they were strongly up-regulated upon CHEK2 down-regulation, reaching levels similar to those observed in CAF-169 (Fig.\u00a02a). On the other hand, CHEK2 knock-down down-regulated p53 (6 fold) as compared to control cells, reaching a level similar to that observed in CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Next, we assessed the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on the expression of SDF-1 and IL-6 at the mRNA levels using qRT-PCR. Figure\u00a02b shows 2 fold increase in the level of SDF-1 and 3 fold up-regulation of IL-6 in TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells as compared to controls. This parallels the levels of SDF-1 and IL-6 in TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02b). This suggests that CHEK2 represses the expression of these genes in breast stromal fibroblasts, indicating that CHEK2 down-regulation may represent an important step towards the activation of these cells.CHEK2 represses the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6 from breast stromal fibroblastsTo further show the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on the expression of important secreted cytokines, we assessed the effect of CHEK2 Knock-down on the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6. To this end, serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) was collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA and their corresponding control cells, and then the secreted levels of SDF-1 and IL-6 was assessed by ELISA. Figure\u00a02c shows that the down-regulation of CHEK2 increased the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6 by 3.3 and 2 fold, respectively. This mirrors the secreted levels of SDF-1 and IL-6 in TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02c).CHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts\nCHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts. TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells and their controls (a), NBF-1-CHEK2-siRNA cells and their controls (b) as well as CAF-169 and TCF-169 cells (c) were seeded with SFM in the inserts of BD bio-coat\u2122 chambers (BD biosciences) (without matrigel, for migration) or coated with matrigel layer (for invasion), while complete media was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers. After 24\u00a0h of incubation, cells were stained with Diff-Quick stain then counted. Upper panels: images of the invaded and migrated cells. Histograms: Average numbers of invaded and migrated cells. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D, *, p value\u2009<\u20090.0001Next, we examined the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on the migratory and invasiveness abilities of stromal fibroblasts. To this end, TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells as well as their respective controls were seeded with SFM in the upper inserts of BD bio-coat\u2122 chambers (BD biosciences) (without matrigel, for migration) or coated with matrigel layer (for invasion), while complete media was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers. Cells were then incubated overnight to allow migration and invasion. Figure\u00a03a shows that TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells were 2- and 3- fold more motile and invasive than their controls, respectively. Similar results were obtained when CHEK2 was knocked-down using the same siRNA in the normal breast stromal fibroblasts NBF-1 (Fig.\u00a03b). These results mirror the migration/invasion abilities of TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 (Fig.\u00a03c). This indicates that CHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts.CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts enhances the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner\nCHEK2 deficient fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner. SFCM were collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells and their controls, and then were added to MCF10A (a)\u00a0or MDA-MB-231 (b)\u00a0cells that were seeded on 96-well plates. The proliferation was measured at the indicated times using the WTS-1 assay. Error bars represent\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, p value\u2009<\u20090.0001To confirm the active status of CHEK2-defective fibroblasts, we tested the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of these fibroblasts. To this end, we first examined the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation in stromal fibroblasts on the proliferation of epithelial cells utilizing indirect co-culturing. Therefore, SFCM was collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells and the corresponding control cells, and were used for culturing the non-cancerous MCF-10A and the cancer MDA-MB-231 epithelial cells seeded in 96 well plates. Cell proliferation was assessed using the WST-1 reagent. Figure\u00a04 shows that after 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h of incubation, SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA enhanced cell proliferation as compared to SFCM from control cells, in both cell lines. This indicates that CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts enhances their ability in increasing the proliferation of breast epithelial cells via paracrine signaling.CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts promotes the migration/invasion abilities of breast cancer cells in an SDF-1/IL-6-dependent manner\nCHEK2-deficient fibroblast secretions stimulate invasion/migration in an SDF1- and IL-6-dependent manner and enhance mesenchymal features in breast cancer cells. a SFCM were collected after 24\u00a0h of incubation from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA and their control cells, and were added to MDA-MB-231 cells (105) that were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24\u00a0h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells were presented in histograms. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. *: p value <0.001, as compared to the control lane 1. b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as indicated, and then the migration and invasion abilities were assessed as described in A. c MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with SFCM from the indicated cells for 24\u00a0h, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodiesWe have next studied the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation in stromal fibroblasts on the migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, these cells were seeded in the upper inserts of the migration and invasion chambers in the presence of SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA and control cells, while the lower inserts of the chambers contained SFM. Cells were incubated overnight to allow migration and invasion under the attraction force of the chemo-attractants that are present in the SFCM. MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated/invaded were fixed, stained and counted in 5 random fields. Figure\u00a05a shows that MDA-MB-231 cells that were exposed to SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA had higher migration/invasion activities as compared to cells exposed to SFCM from the corresponding control cells. Indeed, SFCM from CHEK2-deficient cells enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells 2- and 7- fold as compared to control cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a05a). These results provide evidence that CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts increases the paracrine pro-migration and -invasion of cancer cells, which further confirms the active status of CHEK2-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts.Next, we sought to investigate the possible role of SDF-1 and IL-6 in the paracrine effects of CHEK2-deficient cells. To this end, both cytokines were inhibited either separately or simultaneously using specific neutralizing antibodies in the SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA. Anti-IgG was also used as negative control. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with these media, and then the migration/invasion abilities of these cells were studied as described above. Figure\u00a05b shows that the inhibition of SDF-1 reduced by 2 fold the migration potential of breast cancer cells as compared to cells exposed to anti-IgG. Interestingly, the inhibition of IL-6 was more potent, reducing the migration to a level similar to that obtained by the double inhibition (7 fold lower as compared to the control). In addition, the inhibition of SDF-1, IL-6 or both in SFCM collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA reduced the invasion potential of breast cancer cells 2.5, 5 and 6 fold, respectively (Fig.\u00a05b). This shows that the paracrine IL-6 effect on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells is stronger than that of SDF-1, and that the pro-migratory/-invasiveness effects of CHEK2-deficient stromal fibroblasts is mediated through increase in the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6, which are in normal situations repressed by CHEK2.CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts enhances the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells in a paracrine mannerTo further study the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on breast cancer cells, we investigated the paracrine effect of CHEK2 deficient fibroblasts on the mesenchymal and epithelial markers of MDA-MB-231 cells. These cells were treated with SFM conditioned with TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA or TCF-169-control-siRNA for 24\u00a0h. Subsequently, protein extracts were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies for EMT markers. Figure\u00a05c shows that the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and Epcam were reduced 2.3 and 12 fold in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA as compared to SFCM from control cells. On the other hand, the levels of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, Twist1 and vimentin were 2.3, 12 and 3 fold higher in breast cancer cells treated with SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA as compared to SFCM from control cells (Fig.\u00a05c). This indicates that SFCM from CHEK2-deficient fibroblast cells can enhance the EMT process in breast cancer cells.Ectopic expression of CHEK2 suppresses the procarcinogenic features of cancer-associated fibroblasts\nCHEK2 upregulation represses breast stromal fibroblasts and their paracrine procarcinogenic effects. CAF-169 cells transfected with CHEK2-ORF (CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF) or control plasmid (CAF-169-control). a Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting analysis. The numbers below the bands indicate the corresponding expression levels after loading correction against GAPDH. b Assessment of the migration/invasion abilities of CAF-169 cells expressing either CHEK2 ORF or control plasmid as described in Fig.\u00a03. c SFCM were collected after 24\u00a0h of incubation from CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells (SFCM-CHEK2-ORF) and control cells (SFCM-control), and then were added to MDA-MB-231 cells. The migration and invasion abilities were assessed as described in Fig.\u00a05a. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. *: p value <0.001In an effort to further confirm the role of CHEK2 in suppressing the procarcinogenic features of breast stromal fibroblasts, we next investigated the effects of CHEK2 ectopic expression in CAF-169 cells, wherein CHEK2 level was shown to be very low (Fig.\u00a01a). Therefore, CAF-169 cells were transfected with a lenti-virus-based plasmid bearing CHEK2-ORF (CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF), and an empty vector was used as control. Whole cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis. Figure\u00a06a shows that the Chk2 level was 2.3 fold higher in CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells as compared to the controls. Interestingly, ectopic expression of the CHEK2 gene in CAF-169 cells strongly reduced the level of both SDF-1 and IL-6 (Fig.\u00a06a). These levels mirror the SDF-1 and IL-6 levels observed in TCF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02b). This finding further supports the role of CHEK2 in suppressing the expression of SDF-1 and IL-6. Next, we studied the migratory and the invasiveness abilities of CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells, using BD chambers. While complete medium was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells were added to the upper wells in the presence of SFM. Figure\u00a06b shows that ectopic expression of CHEK2 reduced the motility (40\u00a0%) and the invasiveness (34\u00a0%) of active CAF-169 cells as compared to control cells. This confirms that CHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities in breast stromal fibroblasts.To further show the role of CHEK2 in suppressing the procarcinogenic effects of CAFs, we investigated the paracrine effect of CHEK2 expression on the migration/invasion capacities of MDA-MB-231. Cells were seeded in the inserts of BD chambers, and SFM conditioned with CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells (SFCM-CHEK2-ORF) as well as control cells (SFCM-control) were placed in the lower wells of the chambers. Cells were incubated overnight to allow migration and invasion. Figure\u00a06c shows that SFCM-CHEK2-ORF reduced the motility (3 fold) and the invasiveness (2.5 fold) of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to SFCM-control. This further confirms that CHEK2 represses the paracrine pro-migration/invasion effects of breast stromal fibroblasts. Together, these results indicate that ectopic expression of the CHEK2 gene in the active CAF-169 fibroblasts transforms these cells to a normal state.DiscussionMyofibroblasts actively contribute to the growth, expansion and dissemination of neoplastic epithelial cells. However, the genes and pathways controlling myofibroblast-related tumor-promoting effects are not fully delineated. Several lines of evidence indicate the implication of tumor suppressor genes in controlling the procarcinogenic effects of stromal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. In the present study we have shown that the tumor suppressor Chk2 protein plays an important role in controlling mammary stromal fibroblast autocrine and paracrine signaling. Indeed, CHEK2 is down-regulated in CAFs as compared to their corresponding TCFs, isolated from the same patients. In addition, we have seen inter-individual variation in the CHEK2 expression among TCF cells. This could be due to different tumor features such as the stage or the grade. Similar differences were previously observed for p16. The CHEK2 decrease suggests a role of cancer cells in suppressing CHEK2 expression in fibroblast cells present in their vicinity, either directly or indirectly. In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that neoplastic cells have the ability to affect their microenvironment and modulate gene expression through secreted factors. This in principle leads to the activation of stromal cells, which in turn fuel the carcinogenic process and promote tumor growth and spread through functional cross-talk with tumor cells. To study the role of CHEK2 down-regulation in these processes, we specifically down-regulated this gene in breast stromal fibroblasts using specific siRNA, and we studied the consequent autocrine and paracrine effects. We have shown that CHEK2 down-regulation activates breast stromal fibroblasts and enhances their paracrine procarcinogenic effects. Indeed, CHEK2-defective cells exhibited higher migratory and invasive capacities, expressed lower levels of p53 and higher levels of the myofibroblast markers \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1, and enhanced the migration/invasion abilities of breast cancer cells and their mesenchymal features in a paracrine manner. Indeed, CHEK2 down-regulation in fibroblasts paracrinaly induced the three major mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, Twist-1 and vimentin, and decreased two major epithelial markers E-cadherin and Epcam in breast cancer cells. This indicates that CHEK2-defective breast stromal fibroblasts enhance the pro-metastatic EMT process in epithelial cells in a paracrine manner. On the other hand, ectopic expression of CHEK2 repressed the migratory/invasiveness abilities of active breast stromal fibroblasts as well as their paracrine effects on breast cancer cells. This confirmed the suppressive role of CHEK2 in the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts.The present data showed also that in addition to its autonomous tumor suppressor function, CHEK2 has also a non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressor activity. This paracrine effect is mediated through controlling the expression/secretion of the pro-carcinogenic cytokines SDF-1 and IL-6, may be through p53 down-regulation. Indeed, p53 represses the expression of both SDF-1 and IL-6, which\u00a0are important promoters of tumor growth and progression. Furthermore, specific inhibition of secreted SDF-1 or IL-6 suppressed the pro-migratory/invasiveness effects of CHEK2-deficient stromal fibroblasts. Interestingly, the double blockage had an inhibitory effect similar to that obtained by the inhibition of IL-6 alone, which was stronger than SDF-1 inhibition (Fig.\u00a05). This indicates that the effects of IL-6 and SDF-1 inhibition were synergistic despite the fact that the 2 molecules act through different receptors and pathways, however, a potential functional interaction between the activated pathways is possible.In addition to Chk2, other important tumor suppressor proteins such as p16, p21, p53, PTEN and CAV-1 are also implicated in repressing the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. This clearly shows that these tumor suppressor proteins represses breast carcinogenesis in both epithelial as well as stromal cells.ConclusionsThe present findings have shown that in addition to its well-known cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function within incipient pro-carcinogenic epithelial cells, stromal fibroblast CHEH2, like other tumor suppressor genes, exerts also non-cell-autonomous effects in breast tumorigenesis. Therefore, stromal fibroblast CHEK2 might constitute a valid therapeutic target to stop tumor progression and/or recurrence.AbbreviationsATCC, American type culture collection; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; siRNA, small interfering RNAReferencesMolecular characterisation of the tumour microenvironment in breast cancerRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisp16(INK4A) Represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsOrigin and function of tumor stroma fibroblastsCHK2 kinase: cancer susceptibility and cancer therapy - two sides of the same coin?CHEK2*1100delC genotyping for clinical assessment of breast cancer risk: meta-analyses of 26,000 patient cases and 27,000 controlsThe CHEK2 I157T variant and breast cancer susceptibility: a systematic review and meta-analysisWang N, Ding H, Liu C, Li X, Wei L, Yu J, Liu M, Ying M, Gao W, Jiang H, et al.

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment.

Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

We therefore demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated mechanism underlying the dynamic regulation of the TME.IntroductionSolid malignancies contain many non-transformed stromal cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In breast cancer, a significant proportion of auxiliary cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), pericytes, myoepithelial and endothelial cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and other immune cell types, cooperate to promote pro-tumorigenic processes such as metastasis and drug resistance. Dramatic gene expression changes in stromal cells are associated with the transformation of normal breast tissue to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and progression from DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is marked by upregulated expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases, revealing an important role of TME components in breast cancer initiation and progression.Among TME cell types, CAFs constitute the major stromal component of many breast cancers and have recently emerged as potential therapeutic targets. Fibroblasts are the main producers of ECM and play fundamental roles in tissue repair, during which they acquire an activated myofibroblast phenotype characterized by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression. Fibroblasts are highly responsive to their microenvironment, interacting with and influencing a wide range of cells. For example, fibroblasts promote angiogenesis through the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), coordinate immune response through cytokine and chemokine release, and influence epithelial stem cells. Ligands from the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) family are well-known fibroblast activators, as are cytokines and proteins involved in ECM remodeling. Extracellular factors, such as cytokines and ECM proteins, mediate the pro-tumorigenic behaviors of CAFs. For instance, CAF-derived CXCL12/stromal derived factor (SDF-1) can mobilize endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to increase vascularization of MCF-7 xenografts. Moreover, subsets of CAFs can increase tumorgenesis and breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) enrichment by secreting interleukins (IL) IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2. Several recent studies have demonstrated that CAFs are heterogeneous and can be derived through activation of tissue-associated fibroblasts, as well as the recruitment of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In fact, up to 20% of CAFs were derived from MSCs in a CXCL6/CXCR6-dependent manner in a mouse model of gastric cancer. An orthotopic breast cancer model revealed that MSCs can be recruited to primary tumor sites and that TGF-\u03b21 is involved in this process. MSCs also acquire CAF-like phenotypes when cultured in tumor conditioned media or mixed with cancer cells in mouse xenografts. The mechanisms underlying MSC recruitment are not fully understood, but it is becoming increasingly clear that this population may contribute to the CAF compartment in the TME.Limited genetic alterations have been described in breast cancer-associated stromal cells, suggesting that changes in gene expression observed in these cells are mainly due to epigenetic reprogramming. For instance, breast cancer cells induce fibroblasts to secrete the ECM protein degrader ADAMTS1 through epigenetic changes, demonstrating that epigenetic reprogramming in stromal cells can be induced by cancer cells. The cancer secretome plays a vital role in the pro-tumorigenic effects of the TME, recruiting stromal cells and reprogramming them to support tumor progression.Several studies have uncovered tumor promoting roles for the secreted TGF-\u03b2 superfamily member and embryonic morphogen NODAL. NODAL expression, while primarily restricted to embryonic development and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), has been observed in melanoma, glioblastoma, breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular cancers, amongst others. In breast cancer, NODAL clinically correlates with stage and vascularization. Moreover, NODAL expression emerges in breast cancers as they transition from DCIS into IDC, wherein interactions between cancer and stromal cells are critical. NODAL inhibition reduces breast cancer-induced neovascularization and mitigates BCSC frequency, tumor growth, and invasion. NODAL may also play an essential role in remodeling the TME. For example, NODAL seems to induce a breast cancer secretome that promotes angiogenesis through regulation of the angiogenic factors platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Furthermore, NODAL expression is inversely correlated with susceptibility to gamma delta (\u03b3\u03b4) T cell cytotoxicity, at least in part through decreased surface expression of the immune activating danger signal MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A/B (MICA/B). CAFs from a gastric cancer mouse model have recently been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation and resistance to doxorubicin via NODAL secretion and NODAL appears to induce CAF-like phenotypes in mouse and human fibroblast cell lines. The extent to which NODAL may affect CAF phenotypes in the breast TME has not, however, been explored.In this study, we investigated the impact of NODAL on CAFs and MSCs within the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) TME. We demonstrate that NODAL strongly correlates with CAFs in breast cancer patients and that this morphogen can directly signal to fibroblasts (but not to MSCs) to induce a CAF-associated phenotype. In addition, mass spectrometry-based proteomics of conditioned media derived from triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and triple-negative inflammatory SUM149 breast cancer cells demonstrated that NODAL is a potent regulator of the breast cancer secretome. Our analyses revealed cancer cell-type-specific alterations in several novel NODAL-regulated factors, including CXCL1, CXCL8, IL-6 and colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1), suggesting that NODAL may impact the ability of breast cancer cells to recruit a variety of stromal cell types. Accordingly, we found that MSC chemotaxis towards breast cancer cells is affected by NODAL-regulated factors such as IL-6. Collectively, these data reveal a previously unknown role for NODAL in the regulation of breast cancer TME.Materials and methodsPatients and tissuesWe assessed 41 samples from 20 surgically resected TNBC tumors from cancer patients diagnosed at the Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, AB in 2017. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Research Ethics Guidelines, Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta \u2013 Cancer Committee with written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.ImmunohistochemistryNODAL and \u03b1-SMA staining in TNBC tissues was performed as previously described for NODAL. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer pH 6.0, followed by peroxidase and serum-free protein blocking. After incubation with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table S8), slides were rinsed in TBS-T and treated with Envison+ HRP anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Color was produced with 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate and counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. Samples were dehydrated in graded alcohol and cover slipped with permanent mounting medium.Evaluation of NODAL and \u03b1-SMA stainingNODAL and \u03b1-SMA evaluation by immunohistochemistry.Table 1\t \t\tn (%)\t \tNODAL score \u2013 median (range)\t2 (0\u20133)\t \t0\t3 (7.3)\t \t1\t10 (24.4)\t \t2\t19 (46.3)\t \t3\t9 (22.0)\t \tNODAL percentage (%) \u2013 median (range)\t50 (5\u2013100)\t \tNA\t3 (7.3)\t \t5\u201320\t12 (29.3)\t \t30\u201340\t7 (17.1)\t \t60\u201380\t14 (34.1)\t \t90\u2013100\t5 (12.2)\t \tNODAL distribution\t\t \tNA\t3 (7.3)\t \tDiffuse\t17 (41.5)\t \tScattered\t20 (48.8)\t \tFocal\t1 (2.4)\t \t\u03b1-SMA score \u2013 median (range)\t2 (1\u20133)\t \t1\t3 (7.3)\t \t2\t29 (70.7)\t \t3\t9 (22.0)\t \tIntensity Association\t\t \tNA\t3 (NA)\t \tYes\t36 (94.7)\t \tNo\t2 (5.3)\t \tLight microscopy and semi-quantitative scoring were performed by 2 pathologists. The entirety of each slide was assessed. Scores for NODAL were 0, absent; 1, weak or very focal staining; 2, strong but focal or moderate intensity; and 3, strong and extensive staining. The score reflects the intensity of staining observed in the majority of cells. When scored 1 to 3, NODAL distribution was further identified as focal, diffuse or scattered, and an estimated proportion of tumor cells staining with NODAL was calculated (NODAL percentage in Table\u00a01). \u03b1-SMA was scored in the same manner on serial sections from the same cases. Intensity association was measured based on the extent to which \u03b1-SMA staining was increased in areas with NODAL-positive cells. Representative images were taken from a Nikon DS U3 camera on Nikon eclipse 80i microscrope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 400 x (500 px bar\u202f=\u202f40 \u03bcm).Cell cultureMDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing scrambled control (shControl) or NODAL targeting (shNODAL) short hairpin RNAs as previously described and validated were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 500ng/mL puromycin. To generate SUM149 cells stably expressing an empty vector (EV), green fluorescent protein (GFP) or NODAL, cells were transduced with lentiviral particles (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD) overnight then selected and maintained in HAM's F10 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5\u00b5g/mL insulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), 1 \u00b5g/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 100 ng/mL puromycin. Human BM-MSC lines were maintained in AmnioMAX with C100 supplement (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA); these lines were previously confirmed to express characteristic stromal markers (>95% CD90+, CD105+, and CD73+) and exhibit multipotent differentiation. HFFs (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and HDFs (ATCC, Manassas, VA) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For SILAC labelling, shControl and shNODAL MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM F12 supplemented with dialyzed FBS (Life Technologies) containing light (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY) or heavy (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA and Silantes GmbH, Germany) isotopes of arginine (0.398 mM) and lysine (0.274 mM) for at least nine days to achieve >90% label incorporation. SILAC media was additionally supplemented with 400 mg/L of proline (Sigma-Aldrich) to limit arginine to proline conversion. CM was prepared by plating equal cell numbers onto flasks in culture media (Corning, Corning, NY). After 24 h (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 48 h (SUM149 cells), media was removed, and cells were thoroughly rinsed 3 times in PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) to remove serum components. Cells were incubated in serum-free media (SFM) with 0.5% BSA for an additional 24h to generate CM (BSA was omitted for LC-MS samples). Conditions used to stimulate cells with rhNODAL and rhIL-6 are specified in the main text.Sample preparation for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)CM (without BSA) were concentrated using 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) Amicon ultracentrifugal units (Millipore, Burlington, MA) and lyophilized overnight. The following day, CM was reconstituted in lysis buffer (8M urea, 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 2% SDS), sonicated (3\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5 s pulses) with a probe sonicator (Level 1; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and quantified using a Pierce 660 nm assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with ionic detergent compatibility reagent. For SlLAC samples, light shControl and heavy shNODAL CM were pooled based on equal cell numbers and \u223c100\u00b5g protein were fractionated using SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide tris-glycine gels. In-gel digestion with trypsin (1:25 enzyme:protein ratio) was performed on 16 to 17 slices (fractions) from each lane in biological triplicate as previously described. For label-free samples, \u223c50\u00b5g protein from SUM149 CM were precipitated in chloroform/methanol, digested overnight with trypsin (1:50 ratio) on a water bath shaker and fractionated on SCX StageTips as previously described. Peptides were dried in a SpeedVac, reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid (FA; Fisher Scientific) and a volume corresponding to one tenth of the total material recovered or 1 \u00b5g as determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Waltham, MA) was injected for each in-gel and SCX fraction, respectively.LC-MSIn-gel and SCX fractions were analyzed using a Q Exactive or Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Samples were injected using a nanoAcquity HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) and initially trapped on a Symmetry C18 Trap Column (5 \u00b5m, 180 \u00b5m x 20 mm) for 4 or 5 minutes in 99% Solvent A (Water/0.1% FA)/1% Solvent B (acetonitrile/0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5l/min. Peptides were separated on an ACQUITY Peptide BEH C18 Column (130\u00c5, 1.7\u00b5m, 75\u00b5m X 250mm) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min maintained at 35\u00b0C. The LC-MS gradient for in-gel digests consisted of 1% to 7% B over 1 minute and 7% to 37.5% B over 79 minutes. SCX fractions were separated using gradient consisting of 7.5% B over 1 minute, 25% B over 179 minutes, 32.5% B over 40 minutes and 60% B over 20 minutes. Column washing and re-equilibration was performed following each run and settings for data acquisition are outlined in Supplementary Table S9.Data analysis and statisticsRaw MS files were searched in MaxQuant (1.5.2.8) with the Human Uniprot database (reviewed only; updated May 2014 with 40,550 entries). Missed cleavages were set to 3 and I\u202f=\u202fL. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation (M), n-terminal acetylation (protein), and deamidation (NQ) were used as variable modifications (max. number of modifications per peptide\u202f=\u202f5) and min ratio count was set to 1. All other settings were left at default. The match-between-runs feature was utilized to maximize proteome coverage and quantitation between samples. Datasets were loaded into Perseus (version 1.5.5.3) and proteins identified by site, reverse and potential contaminants were removed. Protein identifications with quantitative values in \u22652 biological replicates were retained for downstream analysis unless specified elsewhere. Missing values were imputed using a width of 0.3 and down shift of 1.8 for label free datasets. Statistical analysis was performed in Perseus or GraphPad Prism version 6.01 (San Diego, CA). All experiments were carried in at least 3 biological replicates unless specified otherwise. Where specified, replicate treatment values were normalized to the control group and relative fold-changes were reported. Two-tailed, 1 sample and 2-sample t tests (P < 0.05) were performed to determine statistical differences unless more than 2 conditions were being compared and a 1-way ANOVA using Dunnett's multiple comparison test (P < 0.05) was performed instead.Chemotaxis and invasion assaysMSCs were rinsed in warm PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and serum starved for \u223c2h in AmnioMAX prior to dissociation with trypsin for chemotaxis assays. In parallel, 8 \u00b5M transwells (Falcon, Corning, NY) were coated with 10 \u00b5g/cm2 of bovine fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 \u00b5L of PBS for 2 h. After coating, excess solution was aspirated and 40K MSCs in 0.5 mL of DMEM F12+0.5% BSA were plated in each transwell. HFFs were serum starved 24h prior to dissociation and plated at a density of 50K cells/transwell. For HFF chemotaxis and invasion assays, fibronectin and Matrigel (Corning) were omitted and included, respectively. To the bottom chamber, 1 mL of DMEM/F12\u202f+\u202f0.5% BSA or CM was added \u00b1 rhNODAL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rhIL-6 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), isotype or IL-6 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (R&D Systems). After \u223c24 h, transwells were rinsed in warm PBS and placed in cold methanol for 20 minutes to fix migrating cells. After fixing, transwells were rinsed in PBS and the inside membrane was thoroughly wiped with a cotton swab to remove non-migrated cells. Membranes were excised and mounted onto glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Migrated cells were counted from at least 5 to 10 high power fields uniformly distributed across the entire membrane for each condition.Western blotting and immunodetectionCells were thoroughly washed with PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and directly lysed on tissue culture plates in lysis buffer. Lysates recovered by pipetting were sonicated with a probe sonicator (20\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.5 s pulses) to shear DNA and reduce viscosity. Equal protein amounts (15\u221225 \u00b5g) were separated on hand cast 8-20% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels then transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were stained with amido black and rinsed in ddH2O for 5 minutes followed by blocking for 1h on rocker in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) and overnight incubation in primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using film or a VersaDoc CCD camera with Clarity Western ECL Substrate and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the next day. Antibody information is available in Supplementary Table S8. Actin and Tubulin were used as loading controls. PVDF membranes were stippled in 0.2 M NaOH and re-probed when possible, otherwise western blots were run in duplicate.DensitometryImmunodetection signals were quantified in Image Studio Lite v. 5.2 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) following the software manufacturer's instructions. Signals from all proteins of interest were normalized by the housekeeping control and phosphorylated proteins were normalized by their respective total protein. Relative expression to control group was calculated where indicated. Statistical analysis was performed for immunoblots with 3 or more replicates.Real-time RT-PCRRNA was isolated from cells and treated with DNAse using a PerfectPure RNA cultured cell kit (5PRIME). RNA was quantified by NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2\u00b5g was reverse transcribed with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR was performed with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a Bio-Rad CFX96/384 thermocycler. HPRT1 or RPLPO were used as housekeeping genes to monitor variations between biological replicates. TaqMan primer probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems and are listed in Supplementary Table S10.Flow cytometryMSCs dissociated in 10mM EDTA/PBS solution for 5 to 10 minutes were resuspended in 5% FBS/PBS, counted, and pelleted at 450xg. Excess buffer was aspirated and MSCs were divided into 50-100K cell aliquots in 100 \u00b5L of 5% FBS/PBS. Isotype controls and primary antibodies (Supplementary Table S8) were added to cell suspensions and incubated for \u223c45 minutes in the dark on ice. Cell suspensions were washed in excess 5% FBS/PBS and pelleted to remove unbound antibody. Flow cytometry data was acquired on an LSR II (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using FACSDiva (Becton Dickinson) at the London Regional Flow Cytometry Facility and analyzed with FlowJo (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR, Version 10.0.8r1). The gating strategy for live singlets was based on forward and side-scatter and is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S7. The CellTrace Violet Cell Proliferation assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was performed as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, MSCs were labeled in suspension with CellTrace Violet dye. After 20 min incubation at 37\u00b0C in the dark, MSCs were incubated for 5 min with culture medium to remove any free dye remaining in the solution. MSCs were pelleted, resuspended in fresh pre-warmed complete culture medium, and plated onto 6-well plates prior to incubation with CM.ELISAsELISA kits were purchased from eBioscience (IL-6) or R&D Systems (CXCL1, CXCL8 and CSF1) and performed according to the manufacturer's specifications using CM derived from MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cell lines.Gene expression profilingHDFs were cultured until \u223c40% to 60% confluence, washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight in DMEM+0.5%FBS. The following day, cells were\u00a0treated \u00b1 rhNODAL (10 ng/mL) for 6 h and RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was subjected to expression profiling at the London Regional Genomics Centre essentially as previously described. RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) prior to preparing single stranded complimentary DNA (sscDNA) from 200 ng of total RNA (Ambion WT Expression Kit for Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript WT Expression Arrays; Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) according to the Affymetrix User Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). In total, 5.5 \u00b5g of sscDNA was synthesized, converted into cRNA, end labeled and hybridized\u00a0(16 h at 45\u00b0C) to Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Liquid handling steps were performed by a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and GeneChips were scanned (GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G; Affymetrix) using Command Console v1.1 to generate Probe level (.CEL file) data. Gene level data was generated using the RMA algorithm. Partek Genomics Suite v6.5 (St. Louis, MO) was used to determine gene level ANOVA P values and fold-changes. Fold-changes were obtained by averaging data from 2 experiments (GeneSpring, Agilent). Fold-changes exceeding 1.7 in response to rhNODAL were required to identify a transcript as being altered (P < 0.05).\u00a0Altered genes were annotated using DAVID (version 6.7) and lists enriched >3.5 fold and comprised of >10 genes were reported.ResultsCancer cells expressing NODAL associate with \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal cells in triple-negative breast tumorsBreast cancer cells expressing NODAL reside adjacent to \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal cells. Representative images are shown wherein NODAL (A, C, E) and \u03b1-SMA (B, D, F) are stained in serial sections of tissue from triple-negative breast cancer patients. (A-D) NODAL-positive breast cancer cells are surrounded by diffuse \u03b1-SMA+ stromal cells (for example in square). (E, F) In NODAL-negative sections, \u03b1-SMA is localized only to basement membranes (arrows). Bar equals 100 \u00b5m.Fig 1Because fibroblast activation (demarcated by \u03b1-SMA expression) and NODAL expression occur early during breast cancer progression, we investigated whether these events could be correlated. We evaluated the expression and localization of NODAL and \u03b1-SMA in 41 primary tumor tissue samples from a cohort of 20 TNBC cases (Table\u00a01). Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a01A-F. NODAL expression was observed in 92.7% of samples (38/41) (Table\u00a01), while \u03b1-SMA was detected in all slides. Stromal-associated \u03b1-SMA (Fig.\u00a01B, D) was observed in all 38 NODAL-positive samples and the intensity of \u03b1-SMA staining was found to be increased in 94.7% (36/38) of regions with NODAL-positive cells as compared to NODAL-negative regions (Table\u00a01). Notably, \u03b1-SMA was also detected in areas that were negative for NODAL; however, in these instances, \u03b1-SMA delineated myoepithelial cells (Fig.\u00a01E, F). Overall, these results reveal a strong association between NODAL and \u03b1-SMA expression in the stroma of TNBC patients, suggesting NODAL could have an impact on CAF phenotypes in breast cancer.NODAL induces fibroblast activation and chemotaxisNODAL directly promotes phenotypes associated with activated fibroblasts in HFFs. (A) NODAL expression in MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing scrambled (shControl) or NODAL knockdown (shNODAL) shRNA cultured in SFM, SFM+0.5%BSA (0.5%BSA), or complete media (10% FBS). (b) HFF chemotaxis towards CM from MDA-MB-231 cells (n\u202f=\u202f6). (C-E) Exposure to rhNODAL (10 and 100ng/mL) significantly increased HFF chemotaxis, proliferation, and invasion (n\u202f=\u202f3); Dunnett's multiple comparison test, *P < 0.05. (F) HFFs upregulated transcripts (a-SMA, DESMIN and CTGF) associated with activated fibroblasts following treatment with rhNODAL (10 and 100ng/mL; n\u202f=\u202f3, n\u202f=\u202f2 for \u03b1-SMA from 100 ng/mL treatment). (G) NODAL expression in GFP- or NODAL-overexpressing SUM149 breast cancer cells. (H) NODAL overexpression increased HFF chemotaxis towards CM from SUM149 cells compared to GFP control (n\u202f=\u202f6); Two-sample t test, ***P < 0.001. (I) Total genes (bars) upregulated by NODAL (10 ng/mL) more than 1.7-fold in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and their corresponding enrichment (black dots) following GO analysis in DAVID.Fig 2Since we found a consistent spatial association between NODAL and stromal \u03b1-SMA in human TNBC tissues, we decided to examine whether NODAL affects, directly or indirectly, breast cancer-induced fibroblast phenotypes (Fig.\u00a02). MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells express high basal levels of NODAL, therefore we investigated if serum-free conditioned media (CM) of MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing scrambled control (shControl) or NODAL knockdown (shNODAL) shRNA (Fig.\u00a02A, Supplementary Figs. S1A and S2A) can differentially impact primary fibroblasts. We also explored the effects of recombinant human NODAL (rhNODAL) on these cells. We detected a small, but statistically insignificant reduction in primary human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) chemotaxis towards CM from shNODAL vs shControl MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a02B), while rhNODAL (10 and 100 ng/mL) increased HFF chemotaxis (Fig.\u00a02C), proliferation (Fig.\u00a02D) and invasion (Fig.\u00a02E). Further addressing fibroblast activation by NODAL, real-time RT-PCR revealed that rhNODAL (10 and 100ng/mL) induced expression of the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA, Desmin, and Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) (Fig.\u00a02F). As a corollary we overexpressed NODAL in SUM149 triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer cells, which express low basal levels of NODAL (Fig.\u00a02G, Supplementary Fig. S1A). In accordance with NODAL's ability to directly activate fibroblasts, CM from NODAL-overexpressing SUM149 cells significantly increased HFF chemotaxis compared to the GFP-expressing control (Fig.\u00a02H). Finally, we performed gene expression profiling on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) treated with 10ng/mL rhNODAL for 6 h. Transcripts upregulated by at least 1.7 fold were analyzed in DAVID; gene clusters associated with the GO terms \u201cwound healing\u201d, \u201ccell motion\u201d, \u201cextracellular matrix\u201d, and \u201cgrowth factor\u201d were significantly enriched (Fig.\u00a02I; Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that fibroblasts are indeed activated by NODAL. The NODAL-regulated genes included factors such as IL6, which are known to impact the TME at large. Hence, we determined that NODAL, derived from breast cancer cells, can directly activate fibroblasts toward a CAF phenotype.The NODAL-regulated MDA-MB-231 secretome impacts MSC chemotaxisConditioned media from NODAL-knockdown MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells indirectly modulates MSC chemotaxis. (A-D) Human bone-marrow derived MSC lines (MSC1-4) were plated onto fibronectin-coated transwells in the presence of CM (shControl or shNODAL \u00b1100 ng/mL rhNODAL). MSC chemotaxis was significantly lower towards shNODAL CM compared to shControl CM after 24 h and was not rescued by rhNODAL; ****P < 0.0001, Dunnett's multiple comparison test.Fig 3The fibroblast population in breast cancer is highly heterogeneous and likely derived from different cell types. Given the involvement of MSCs in tumor growth and neovascularization, and their probable contribution to the CAF population, we examined how NODAL affects the capacity of breast cancer cells to promote chemotaxis by comparing the ability of CM from shControl and shNODAL knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells to influence MSC chemotaxis (Fig.\u00a03). Several primary human bone marrow-derived (BM-)MSC lines were utilized herein, some of which have been previously shown to form tubes in vitro and stimulate islet regeneration and revascularization in vivo . In 3 out of 4 MSC lines, chemotaxis was significantly decreased (\u223c1.8 to 3.5-fold) towards shNODAL CM as compared to shControl CM (Fig.\u00a03A-D). We did not observe appreciable differences in proliferation or viability of MSCs cultured in CM for 24h, suggesting that the effects observed were not due to alterations in cell numbers, but rather a result of altered chemotaxis (Supplementary Fig. S3A).NODAL signaling in MSCs. (A) Real time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for NODAL, ALK4 and CRIPTO in MSCs. Data are presented as mean Ct values \u00b1 SD from three biological replicates except for CRIPTO (n\u202f=\u202f2 for MSC2). High Ct values indicate low transcript expression with the horizontal dotted line corresponding to a Ct value of 35 or the reliable limit of detection. (B) Western blots showing expression of NODAL and ALK4 (receptor) in 4 MSC lines. shControl and shNODAL MDA-MB-231 cells were used as positive controls. (C) Serum-starved MSCs treated with varying concentrations of rhNODAL had no effect on downstream SMAD2 (p-SMAD2) or ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) activation. TGF-\u03b2 treatment and cell culture media were used as positive controls for SMAD2 and ERK1/2 activation, respectively. (D) Stimulation of HFFs with rhNODAL activates SMAD2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion. Western blots are representative images taken from three biological replicates.Fig 4The reduction in MSC chemotaxis observed when NODAL was knocked down could not be rescued by the addition of 100 ng/mL of rhNODAL (Fig.\u00a03A, B, D), suggesting that MSCs are unable to sense this morphogen, perhaps due to an absence of receptor components. Hence, we performed real-time RT-PCR and western blotting for NODAL, its receptor (ALK4) and co-receptor (CRIPTO) on MSC lines (Fig.\u00a04A, B; Supplementary Fig. S2B). MSCs expressed moderate levels of NODAL and high levels of ALK4 at the transcript and protein level (Fig.\u00a04A, B). CRIPTO mRNA expression approached the reliable limit of detection by quantitative real-time PCR (35 cycles) (Fig.\u00a04A). Hence, while MSCs appear to make NODAL and to express NODAL receptors, they may not express enough CRIPTO to sense NODAL. Stimulation with 10 and 100 ng/mL rhNODAL did not affect canonical or non-canonical signalling through SMAD2 or ERK1/2 phosphorylation, respectively (Fig.\u00a04C; Supplementary Figs. S1B and S2C). In contrast to MSCs, which appeared unresponsive to NODAL, we found that rhNODAL (10 and 100 ng/mL) caused an increase in both SMAD2 and ERK1/2 activation in fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a04D; Supplementary Figs. S1C and S2E). Collectively, our results suggest that breast cancer derived NODAL may affect stromal cells directly, through the activation of fibroblasts, and indirectly by modulating factors secreted by breast cancer cells.NODAL regulates the breast cancer secretomeNODAL knockdown alters the MDA-MB-231 secretome. Extracellular proteins from serum-free shControl and shNODAL CM were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. (A) Venn diagram highlighting total protein identifications, number of \u201cextracellular\u201d and quantified proteins, and significantly different proteins between shControl and shNODAL CM (two-tailed, one sample t test, P < 0.05). (B) Number of significant proteins (bars) matching to a subset of significantly enriched (Benjamini Hochberg (BH) FDR threshold<0.02) GO biological processes (GOBPs). Mean log2 fold-changes in GOBPs are indicated by black dots. Blue and red bars highlight GOBPs decreased and increased in MDA-MB-231 CM following NODAL knockdown, respectively. (C) Volcano plot of quantified \u201cextracellular\u201d proteins. Negative and positive Log2 Heavy/Light ratios indicate proteins decreased and increased in MDA-MB-231 CM following NODAL knockdown, respectively (n\u202f=\u202f3). All proteins matching to corresponding GOBPs mentioned are highlighted in blue and red. Several cytokines and chemokines altered by NODAL are labelled in black. Vertical and horizontal dotted lines indicate log2 fold-changes \u22652 and the \u2013log10P-value cut-off corresponding to P < 0.05, respectively.Fig 5Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for proteomic characterization of cancer cell lines and tissues. To further elucidate the mechanisms through which NODAL may influence stromal cells, we employed high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify NODAL-regulated factors in serum-free CM from breast cancer cells. Stable isotopic labelling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) was combined with SDS-PAGE fractionation to determine relative changes in secreted proteins from shControl and shNODAL MDA-MB-231 cells. In total, this approach identified over 3200 proteins, which were reduced to \u223c1300 entries after filtering for proteins annotated with Gene Ontology Cellular Component (GOCC) terms containing \u201cextracellular\u201d and quantified in at least 2 out of 3 biological replicates (Fig.\u00a05A, Supplementary Table S2). Of those, 122 proteins were significantly different (P < 0.05) between shControl and shNODAL CM (Fig.\u00a05A, Supplementary Table S2). From this list, 1D annotation enrichment in Perseus revealed a significant decrease in proteins involved in GO Biological Processes (GOBPs) associated with cell migration, inflammation and cytokine signalling following NODAL knockdown (Fig.\u00a05B, Supplementary Table S3). Alternatively, proteins matching to GOBP terms mRNA processes, protein localization and macromolecular complex disassembly were significantly increased. This observation was attributed to higher levels of ribosomal proteins (RPS and RPL members) shed by shNODAL MDA-MB-231 cells. We plotted Heavy/Light ratios (shNODAL/shControl) and their corresponding \u2013log10P values for the \u223c1300 filtered extracellular proteins found in MDA-MB-231 CM (Fig.\u00a05C). All proteins annotated with the aforementioned GOBP terms were highlighted in blue (depleted) or red (enriched); there was a clear trend towards a reduction in the secretion of inflammatory and chemotactic proteins following NODAL knockdown and an opposing increase in transcriptional and translational proteins. CXCL chemokines (CXCL1/3/8), IL-6 and CSF1 were significantly lower in shNODAL CM (p<0.05). Interleukin 11 (IL-11), on the other hand, was significantly higher (\u223c1.85 fold, P < 0.05). These factors have been associated with malignant phenotypes and may contribute to MSC chemotaxis given that they can promote chemotaxis of various immune cells and, in some cases, MSCs. Similar to previous findings, PDGFA was significantly lower in shNODAL CM (-2.31 fold). Proteomic findings were verified by ELISAs with CM from MDA-MB-231 cells for CXCL1, CXCL8, IL-6 and CSF1 (Supplementary Fig. S4A).NODAL overexpression alters the SUM149 secretome and affects MSC chemotaxis. Extracellular proteins from SUM149 serum-free CM (GFP or NODAL) were analyzed by mass spectrometry.

(B) Number of significant proteins (bars) matching to subset of significantly enriched GOBPs (BH FDR threshold<0.02). Mean log2 fold-changes in GOBPs are indicated by black dots. Blue and red bars highlight GOBPs decreased and increased in SUM149 CM following NODAL overexpression, respectively. (C) Volcano plot of quantified \u201cextracellular\u201d proteins. Negative and positive log2 fold-changes indicate proteins decreased and increased in SUM149 CM following NODAL overexpression, respectively (n\u202f=\u202f3).

Vertical and horizontal dotted lines indicate log2 fold-changes \u22652 and the \u2013log10 p-value cut-off corresponding to P < 0.05, respectively.

Data are presented as mean fold-changes relative to controls from a minimum of three biological replicates \u00b1 SD. Black dots indicate replicate values and asterisks indicate significance differences (1-way ANOVA, Dunnett's multiple comparison test) in MSC chemotaxis compared controls (*** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001). (E) Overlap in proteins differentially expressed (increased or decreased) in MDA-MB-231 (shControl vs shNODAL), SUM149 (NODAL vs GFP) and HDF (rhNODAL-treated vs untreated) datasets.Fig 6As a corollary we used the NODAL-overexpressing and GFP control SUM149 cells (Fig.\u00a02G) from which Strong Cation Exchange (SCX)-fractionated CM digests were obtained for label-free quantitative proteomics. Approximately 1500 proteins were annotated as \u201cextracellular\u201d and quantified in at least 2 out of 3 biological replicates, and 344 proteins were significantly different between NODAL- and GFP-expressing SUM149 cells (Fig.\u00a06A, Supplementary Table S4). GOBPs that were significantly enriched or depleted included terms associated with inflammation, cell migration/locomotion, translation, and transcription (Fig.\u00a06B, Supplementary Table S5). Unexpectedly, GOBPs depleted in shNODAL MDA-MB-231 samples were also depleted in NODAL-overexpressing SUM149 CM. For instance, proteins matching the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway had a mean log2 fold-change of -2.28 and -2.44 following NODAL knockdown and overexpression, respectively (Fig.\u00a05B and 6B). Conversely, proteins matching \u201cmRNA metabolic process\u201d were increased significantly by NODAL knockdown in MDA-MB-231 and NODAL overexpression in SUM149 with mean log2 fold-changes of 1.51 and 1.88, respectively. We also plotted log2 protein fold-changes for SUM149 secretomes (NODAL-GFP) vs \u2013log10P values and highlighted all proteins annotated with the aforementioned GOBPs (Fig.\u00a06C). Several inflammatory and migratory factors decreased following NODAL overexpression while translational and transcriptional proteins were elevated. As in NODAL knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells, CXCL1, CXCL3, IL-6 and CSF1 levels also decreased following NODAL overexpression in SUM149 cells. Highly similar proteomic results were also observed when comparing CM from NODAL overexpressing SUM149 cells to cells expressing an empty vector (EV) (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). In line with results suggesting that NODAL affects MSC chemotaxis indirectly by reprogramming the breast cancer secretome, CM derived from NODAL-overexpressing SUM149 cells induced less chemotaxis in MSC2 cells compared to CM from the GFP-expressing control cells (Fig.\u00a06D). We confirmed by flow cytometry that differences in chemotaxis were not due to altered proliferation or viability (Supplementary Fig. S3B; data not shown).Effects of NODAL manipulation on signaling pathways in MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells. Western blotting revealed similarities and differences in activation of downstream pathways. NODAL expression (NODAL and shControl cell lines) was associated with increased phosphorylation of STAT3, SMAD2 and SMAD3. Basal levels of p-SMAD2 and p-ERK1/2 were substantially higher in SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. p-ERK1/2 decreased slightly following NODAL overexpression in SUM149 cells. Western blots are representative images taken from three biological replicates and asterisks denote high contrast image settings.Fig 7In total, 56 proteins were significantly altered by NODAL in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 datasets; however, only a handful were associated with NODAL expression in a positive (CLU and CLSTN3) and negative (leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF] and neuropillin-2 [NRP2]) manner in both cell lines. Moreover, NODAL promoted a pro-angiogenic phenotype in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells. For example, although PDGFA was not detected in SUM149 CM, the angiogenic factors angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) and angiogenin (ANG) were significantly elevated in CM from NODAL-overexpressing SUM149 cells (Fig.\u00a07D, Supplementary Tables S4 and S6). In a Venn diagram to assess relationships among differentially expressed proteins from MDA-MB-231, HDF, and SUM149 proteomics and microarray datasets, we found several factors consistently altered by NODAL, albeit some inversely correlated with NODAL levels (Fig.\u00a06E). IL-6, LIF, and NRP2 were shared amongst all 3 datasets; however, CXCL1/3 appeared to be exclusively modulated in breast cancer cells. Hence, NODAL may indirectly affect MSC chemotaxis by altering the breast cancer secretome, and by inducing fibroblast activation concomitant with increased levels of proteins such as IL6.Our data demonstrate that the effects of NODAL are highly context-dependent. These differential responses may be due, in part, to which signal transduction pathways NODAL induces. Indeed, ELISAs showed that CXCL1 and IL-6 levels were substantially higher in GFP expressing SUM149 cells compared to MDA-MB-231 cell lines grown to similar confluence (Supplementary Fig. S4B, C), suggesting different regulatory mechanisms between these cell lines. Canonically, NODAL triggers phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 via binding to its receptors ActRIIB/ALK(4/7) and co-receptor CRIPTO. Phospho-SMAD2/3-SMAD4 heterodimers subsequently translocate into the nucleus to regulate the epigenetic status and transcription of target genes. NODAL can also signal non-canonically to activate ERK1/2, which is required for the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion.Given the disparate effects of NODAL on cytokine secretion in MDA-MB-231 vs SUM149 cells, we hypothesized that NODAL may activate different signaling mediators like TGF-\u03b2 in a cell-type dependent manner. Accordingly, the activation of 2 documented mediators of NODAL signaling (SMAD2/3 and ERK1/2) were measured by Western blotting in breast cancer cells wherein NODAL levels had been modified (Fig.\u00a07; Supplementary Figs. S1E and S2F). NODAL knockdown in MDA-MB-231 resulted in an expected and previously described reduction in both SMAD2/3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. While overexpression of NODAL in SUM149 increased SMAD2 phosphorylation, a small reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed. Moreover, constitutive SMAD2 activation was higher, while ERK1/2 was lower in SUM149 compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, we examined STAT3 activation, which occurs downstream of IL-6. In accordance with reduced IL-6 levels, NODAL knockdown reduced STAT3 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. However, NODAL overexpression did not appear to affect STAT3 activation in SUM149 cells, perhaps due to the highly inflammatory nature of this cell line. These results suggest that some of the observed cell-type-specific effects of NODAL may relate to differential levels of SMAD2/3 and ERK1/2 activation induced by this ligand; MDA-MB-231 cells have higher ERK1/2 and lower SMAD2/3 basal activation compared to SUM149 cells. Hence, NODAL may preferentially signal through SMAD2/3 in SUM149 and ERK1/2 in MDA-MB-231 cells.IL-6 promotes MSC chemotaxisIL-6 promotes MSC chemotaxis. (A) Flow cytometry showing nearly homogenous expression of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) by MSCs. (B) Stimulation with rhIL-6 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in MSC2, which could be blocked by pre-incubation with an IL-6 neutralizing mAb. (C) MSC chemotaxis towards rhIL-6 after 24h (n\u202f=\u202f4\u22128). Low concentrations (1-10 ng/mL) of rhIL-6 significantly induced MSC chemotaxis (Dunnett's multiple comparison test, *P < 0.05). (D) IL-6 neutralizing mAb significantly attenuated MSC chemotaxis. (E) Exogenous rhIL-6 significantly increased MSC chemotaxis towards shNODAL CM. Flow histogram and western blots are representative images from three biological replicates. Data are presented as mean fold-changes relative to controls \u00b1 SD. Black dots indicate replicate values and asterisks indicate significance differences (one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's multiple comparison test for IL-6 dose response and two-tailed, two sample t test for MDA-MB-231 treatments) in MSC chemotaxis compared to controls (*P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01).Fig 8Given that NODAL consistently altered CXCL1 and IL-6 levels in CM, which were associated with differential MSC chemotaxis, we sought to determine whether receptors for these ligands were expressed by MSCs. While 3 MSC lines were highly positive for IL-6R based on flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a08A; Supplementary Fig. S5A, B), surface CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression could not be detected in any of the MSC lines by real-time PCR or flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S5C; data not shown). Accordingly, treatment with 10 and 25 ng/mL recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) induced STAT3 phosphorylation in MSC2 cells, which could be blocked by the addition of an IL-6 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb, Fig.\u00a08B; Supplementary Figs. S1D and S2D). Moreover, low doses of rhIL-6 (1 and 10 ng/mL) significantly increased MSC2 chemotaxis by \u223c1.6 fold (P < 0.05) although higher concentrations had no effect (Fig.\u00a08C). Neutralizing IL-6 in shControl CM resulted in a small, but significant, decrease in MSC2 chemotaxis (Fig.\u00a08D), while supplementing shNODAL CM with rhIL-6 (1 ng/mL) increased MSC2 chemotaxis (Fig.\u00a08E). These findings suggest that IL-6 may be involved in promoting MSC recruitment to breast cancers.DiscussionThe TME facilitates pro-tumorigenic processes, among which fibroblast activation \u2013 a common trait of many cancers, including breast carcinomas \u2013 plays an important role. Many factors activate fibroblasts, such as TGF-\u03b2, CXCL12/SDF-1, PDGFA/B, and IL-6. NODAL has been shown to directly induce migration and invasion of breast, pancreatic, and hepatocellular cancer cell lines in vitro. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of NODAL in breast cancer cells indirectly promotes endothelial tube formation by increasing the expression of pro-angiogenic proteins such as PDGFA. Recent efforts have shown that NODAL alters breast cancer cell susceptibility to \u03b3\u03b4 T cell killing by acting on cancer cells to decrease recognizable antigens on the cell surface. Furthermore, long-term NODAL stimulation reduced V\u03b42 T cell antigen receptor expression, suggesting activation of an as-of-yet unidentified signaling pathway in primary \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. We build upon these studies by showing that NODAL may affect TME function and composition directly or indirectly by broadly regulating the breast cancer secretome. Specifically, we show that NODAL activates fibroblasts directly, but that it affects MSC chemotaxis indirectly, by reprogramming secreted factors, such as IL6.We have shown herein that cells expressing the CAF marker \u03b1-SMA are spatially correlated with NODAL-positive cancer cells in human TNBC tissues, and that NODAL expression levels positively correlate to those of stromal \u03b1-SMA in these tissues. We demonstrate for the first time that NODAL signals directly on fibroblasts to induce an activated phenotype, characterized by increased proliferation rates, invasive capacity, and the expression of transcripts of known CAF markers. The origin of CAFs has been extensively debated over the years, with evidence pointing to diverse sources such as resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived MSCs, hematopoietic stem cells, epithelial cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and endothelial cells. A recent study has shown that the MDA-MB-231, but not MCF-7, secretome activates MSCs, converting them into tumor-associated MSCs. We similarly show that although MSCs are unable to sense and respond to NODAL signals, they still undergo chemotaxis toward the NODAL-regulated breast cancer cell secretome.Our robust proteomics approach allowed us to uncover dozens of secreted proteins that are affected by NODAL expression in breast cancer cells and may impact MSC recruitment to the breast TME. For these studies, we knocked down NODAL in claudin-low MDA-MB-231 cells that express high basal levels of NODAL, and overexpressed NODAL in SUM149, which represent inflammatory breast cancer cells and express low levels of NODAL. Consistent with the effects of NODAL in vitro and in vivo, the levels of several pro-angiogenic factors (PDGFA, ANGPT1, and ANG) in breast cancer CM were positively correlated with its expression. However, we also made the seemingly paradoxical discovery that the expression of NODAL in MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 breast cancer cells oppositely regulates cytokines involved in chemotaxis. This difference may be coincident with the models chosen: MDA-MB-231 express relatively low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to SUM149, and thus the epigenetic regulation of the genes encoding these proteins may vary dramatically between the 2 cells lines.Our discordant results are not uncommon for studies involving members of the TGF-\u03b2 family, which function in a context-dependent manner. TGF-\u03b21, for example, induces IL-6 production in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells via SMAD2/TGFBRII and p38 MAPK. Moreover, in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, TGF-\u03b21 stimulates IL-8 (CXCL8) and IL-11 secretion via SMAD3/TGFBRI and p38 MAPK. However, in the Polyomavirus middle T antigen transformed mouse mammary carcinoma model, loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling results in the upregulation of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CCL20. Remarkably, these factors decreased substantially in SUM149 CM following NODAL overexpression (Supplementary Tables S4 and S6), thus suggesting negative regulatory roles for both NODAL and TGF-\u03b2. We did not observe significant differences in the levels of TGF-\u03b21/2 between breast cancer lines (Supplementary Tables S2, S4, and S6), hence the effects of NODAL were not likely mediated via alterations in TGF-\u03b21/2. Taken together, both NODAL and TGF-\u03b2 may differentially regulate chemokine and cytokine expression in cancer, depending on the context. This difference should be considered as treatment modalities designed to target these pathways evolve.Genes regulated by NODAL appear to be dictated, at least in part, by the accessibility of genomic regions, and NODAL induces histone modifications to affect gene expression. Hence the differential effects of NODAL in MDA-MB-231 vs SUM149 cells may be due to differences in chromatin accessibility in the areas surrounding chemotactic and inflammatory cytokines. The differences observed may also be due to the ability of NODAL to activate ERK signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in SUM149 cells. Several studies have demonstrated the role of ERK signaling in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Hence the effects of NODAL knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells may be due to reduced ERK signaling.While IL-6R was detected on MSC, CXCR1 and CXCR2 were not. Heterogeneity in MSC receptor expression has been reported in multiple studies and may be a product of culture conditions and donor heterogeneity. For reference, Ponte et\u00a0al observed CXCR4 and CXCR5 but not CXCR1 or CXCR2 on human BM-MSC. Chamberlain et\u00a0al also reported high expression for CXCR4 and CXCR5 but low to intermediate expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively. Conversely, Ringe et\u00a0al extensively profiled chemokine receptors on human BM-MSC and detected CXCR1 and CXCR2 but noted loss of expression following 10 passages. While these pathways may play a role in MSC recruitment to tumors in breast cancer patients, we were unable to test this possibility.In our hands, MDA-MB-231 cells produced less IL-6 and CXCL1 than those studied by Hartman et\u00a0al, who investigated the role of cytokines in TNBC cell growth. Notwithstanding, neutralizing IL-6 in MDA-MB-231 CM was sufficient to attenuate MSC chemotaxis. We did not neutralize IL-6 in SUM149 CM; however, CM from either SUM149 or SUM159 breast cancer cells was previously shown to promote migration of aldehyde dehydrogenase-high MSC or macrophage-educated MSC in an IL-6 dependent manner.Although CXCR1/2 was not detected on MSC, differences in CXCL1 and CXCL8 levels following NODAL knockdown/overexpression remain important for cancer progression and trafficking of additional cell types and justify additional interrogation. For instance, CXCL1-mediated recruitment of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells enhanced breast cancer cell survival, chemoresistance, and metastasis. Moreover, obesity-associated CXCL1 expression in prostate tumors was linked to adipose-derived stromal cell migration in vitro and tumor engraftment in vivo . Given the importance of NODAL-regulated cytokines in the TME, future studies interrogating the extent to which NODAL may modulate TME composition are warranted.Proposed model for NODAL signaling in the breast cancer microenvironment. NODAL signals directly to breast cancer cells and CAFs, and indirectly regulates secretion of inflammatory, chemotactic and angiogenic factors by breast cancer cells, which act on endothelial and mesenchymal stromal cells and possibly immune cell types. Collectively, NODAL promotes tumorigenic phenotypes including tumor growth, neovascularization, cell migration and cell fate specification.Fig 9In summary, we demonstrate that NODAL directly activates stromal fibroblasts and that it reshapes the breast cancer secretome, affecting the deposition of factors such as IL-6, which may regulate the recruitment of MSCs, as well as other TME cell types (Fig.\u00a09). Expanding our previous discovery that NODAL induces secretion of PDGF and VEGF by breast cancer cells, our present findings illuminate a hitherto unappreciated role for NODAL in the orchestration of the tumor microenvironment.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Dean Betts, Dr. John Di Guglielmo and Dr. Dwayne Jackson from Western University for providing access to PCR and imaging equipment and Paula Pittock for technical support.Competing interestsAll authors declare that they have no competing financial or nonfinancial interests that might have influenced the performance or presentation of the work described in this manuscript.Authors\u2019 contributionsDDC: Conceptualization; Methodology; Data curation; Formal analysis; statistical analysis; Writing \u2013 original draft.

This study demonstrated that, across estrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1\u2011positive and \u2011negative cell lines, recombinant human IL\u20116 (rhIL\u20116) mimicked most of the CAF\u2011conditioned medium (CM)\u2011induced changes in protein expression patterns; however, in most cases, it failed to recapitulate CAF\u2011CM\u2011triggered alterations in ERK1/2 and AKT activities. The ability of rhIL\u20116 to induce fulvestrant resistance was dependent upon the culture conditions. In 3D, but not in 2D cultures, rhIL\u20116 increased the survival of fulvestrant\u2011treated cells, although not to the same extent as observed with CAF\u2011CM. In 2D cultures, rhIL\u20116 acted in a pro\u2011apoptotic manner and decreased the expression of ATP\u2011binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2). The inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway had similar effects on apoptosis and ABCG2 expression, linking the failure of rhIL\u20116 to induce fulvestrant resistance to its inability to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. In 3D cultures, both CAF\u2011CM and rhIL\u20116 acted in an anti\u2011apoptotic manner. These activities are likely independent on the PI3K/AKT pathway and ABCG2. Experiments on ER\u03b1\u2011negative breast cancer cells revealed a growth\u2011inhibitory effects of both CAF\u2011CM and rhIL\u20116, which coincided with a reduction in the c\u2011Myc level. These data suggest that IL\u20116 plays a role in several effects of CAF\u2011CM, including alterations in protein expression patterns, fulvestrant resistance in 3D cultures and growth inhibition. By contrast, IL\u20116 is unlikely to be responsible for the CAF\u2011CM\u2011induced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and fulvestrant resistance in 2D cultures.",

In 3D cultures, both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 acted in an anti-apoptotic manner. These activities are likely independent on the PI3K/AKT pathway and ABCG2. Experiments on ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells revealed a growth-inhibitory effects of both CAF-CM and rhIL-6, which coincided with a reduction in the c-Myc level. These data suggest that IL-6 plays a role in several effects of CAF-CM, including alterations in protein expression patterns, fulvestrant resistance in 3D cultures and growth inhibition. By contrast, IL-6 is unlikely to be responsible for the CAF-CM-induced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and fulvestrant resistance in 2D cultures.IntroductionBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among women worldwide. Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease which can be divided into immunohistochemical and molecular subtypes. The most frequent subtype expresses estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1), which can be targeted by anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors. Less frequent subtypes are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2)-positive breast cancers, which are vulnerable to Her2 inhibitors and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which are devoid of ER\u03b1, Her2 and progesterone receptor. For TNBCs, selective drugs are still not available. Breast cancers also exhibit intratumoral heterogeneity, part of which is caused by cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have been linked to tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance.Drug resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. Different mechanisms leading to drug resistance are known. Endocrine resistance often involves the activation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and/or Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK-1)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-1)/ERK1/2 pathways, which are both able to activate ER\u03b1 independently of estrogen. The activation of these pathways can occur intrinsically or extrinsically. By interacting with breast cancer cells, stromal cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), can extrinsically activate these pathways and thereby promote the development of endocrine resistance.Recently, the authors demonstrated that MSCs and CAFs are able to induce resistance to the selective ER\u03b1 down-regulator, fulvestrant, in breast cancer cells by increasing the expression of the atypical inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB (I\u03baB) family member B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3 (Bcl-3). Bcl-3, whose expression can also be induced by the withdrawal of estrogen, has been associated with higher metastatic activities in breast cancer. Bcl-3 is a potent activator of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway, a pathway that has also been linked to endocrine resistance. In addition, the activity of Bcl-3 is positively regulated by the PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathways.The stromal cell-induced increase in Bcl-3 expression has been shown to be causally linked to a prior downregulation of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) level. A main function of IGFBP5 is to regulate the availability of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) for the interaction of this growth factor with its receptor, IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). In addition, IGFBP5 can also act without targeting IGF. Such an IGF-independent effect may be responsible for the regulation of Bcl-3 by IGFBP5. There is evidence to indicate that IGFBP5 plays an important role in breast cancer progression and that it is of prognostic value. Notably, IGFBP5 expression is higher in ER\u03b1-positive tumors.The stromal cell-induced desensitization of MCF-7 cells to fulvestrant does not require direct contact between stromal and breast cancer cells; however, it can be fully recapitulated by conditioned medium (CM) derived from stromal cells. CM can also mimic all effects of stromal cells on signaling pathways, namely the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), PI3K/AKT and the Ras/Raf/MEK-1/ERK1/2 pathways, as well as on the expression of proteins, namely Bcl-3, integrin \u03b21, IGF1R and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). This suggests that factors secreted by stromal cells are responsible for the desensitization to fulvestrant and for alterations in protein expression.Interleukin (IL)-6 belongs to the IL-6 family of cytokines. By forming a complex with the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130), IL-6 activates JAKs. Downstream targets of JAKs are STATs, MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways, whereby the activation of STAT3 is a major cellular response to IL-6. Soluble IL-6R allows trans signaling. In trans signaling, an extracellular complex of IL-6 and IL-6R activates gp130-expressing targets cells. Since, in this case, the target cells do not need to express IL-6R by themselves, the number of cells that can respond to IL-6 increases. IL-6 is primarily secreted by leukocytes to regulate hematopoietic cells involved in inflammation and adaptive immunity. In addition, IL-6 acts on non-hematopoietic cells, such as fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells and may, when deregulated, lead to the development of certain diseases, such as fibrosis. Epithelial cells benefit from the survival-promoting activity of IL-6, helping damaged epithelia to be repaired. Intriguingly, IL-6 also supports the survival of premalignant epithelial cells, which links IL-6 to cancer progression. Strikingly, IL-6 has often been found to be upregulated in the bodily fluids of cancer patients and activated STAT3 is a common feature of numerous cancer types. IL-6 has been associated with inflammation and multidrug resistance in cancer. In breast cancer, IL-6 has been found to induce resistance to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and the Her2 antibody trastuzumab and has been shown to contribute to chemoresistance. Evidence for a role of IL-6 in maintaining cancer stem cell activity in breast cancer has also been provided. IL-6 is able to increase the cancer stem cell population and, along with it, the expression of crucial stemness factors, such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4). IL-6 also induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which promotes cancer stem cell activity. The ability of IL-6 to induce drug resistance has been found to be linked to its stemness-supporting activity. IL-6 has further been shown to be involved in a cytokine network between MSCs, CSCs and non-CSC breast cancer cells. Based on the assumption that CSCs are the likely drivers of metastasis, it is noteworthy that IL-6 serum levels are higher in breast cancer patients with metastatic disease.Given its multiple effects on cancer progression, IL-6 has been discussed as a promising target for drug intervention in breast cancer. IL-6- or IL-6R-directed drugs are already routinely used for treatment of diseases with excessive IL-6 expression, such as inflammatory arthritis and could therefore be made available for cancer treatment. Since the major source of IL-6 are MSCs and CAFs in cancer, in this study, the potential of recombinant IL-6 to mimic the effects of stromal cells on fulvestrant resistance and on the expression and activities of those proteins which may be involved therein was examined.This study demonstrates that IL-6 is the mediator of the majority of the CAF-CM-induced effects on protein expression and on STAT3 phosphorylation, although not on PI3K/AKT pathway activity. It is further demonstrated that IL-6 participates in CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 3D spheroid cultures, but not in 2D adherent cultures. In addition, it was found that IL-6 likely contributes to the growth-inhibitory effects of CAF-CM on ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells.Materials and methodsCell lines and agentsMCF-7, BT474, T47D, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which were authenticated by SNP analysis (Genolytic), were propagated in RMPI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech). The MCF-7 subline, AnD5 cells, and the generation of CAF-CM have been described previously. One part CAF-CM was mixed with four parts fresh medium/serum (20% CAF-CM). Recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) was purchased from PeproTech and reconstituted in water as recommended by the provider. Fulvestrant (LKT Laboratories) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M.RNA interferenceThe p110\u03b1 (pik3ca)-specific siRNA siPIK (5\u2032-GUACAGGACUUCCGAAGAA-3\u2032), siBcl-3 (5\u2032-UGGUC UUCUCUCCGCAUCA-3\u2032) and the control siRNA and Firefly luciferase-siRNA siLuc (5\u2032-CUUACGCUG AGUACUUCGA-3\u2032), were purchased from Eurofins MWG. Transfections were performed by electroporation by using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-Cell as previously described. Briefly, following electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-cell (250 V, 800 \u00b5F), cells were seeded on a 10 cm culture dish and incubated for 3 days to allow the siRNA to downregulate its specific target.Western blot analysisProtein extractions and western blot analysis were carried out as previously described. Blots were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The primary antibodies used are listed below. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies: Anti-p(S473)-AKT (1:2,000, D9E, #4060, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Bcl-3 (1:1,000, C-14, sc-185, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ER\u03b1 (1:2,000, HC-20, sc-543, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p(Thr202, Tyr204)-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 (both 1:2,000, #9101 and #9102, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-IGF1R\u03b2 (1:2,000, #3027, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1; 1:2,000, C-20, sc-208, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p(Tyr705)-STAT3 (1:1,000, D3A7, #9145, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-STAT3 (1:1,000, 79D7, #4904, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit monoclonal antibodies: Anti-PI3 linase p110\u03b1 (1:1,000, C73F8, #4249, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Her2 (1:1,000, 29D8, #2165, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-NF-\u03baB1 p105/p50 (1:1,000, D4P4D, #13586, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p21 Waf1/Cip1 (1:1,000, 12D1, #2947, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-integrin \u03b21 (1:2,000, EPR1040Y, ab134179, Abcam), anti-ABCG2 (1:1,000, EPR20080, ab207732, Abcam), anti-Ki67 (1:2,000, EPR3610, ab92742, Abcam), anti-c-Myc (1:500, EP121, AC-0116, Epitomics) and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1; cleaved 25 kDa; 1:10,000, #1051-1, Epitomics); mouse monoclonal antibodies: Anti-(pan) AKT (1:2,000, 40D4, #2920, Cell Signaling Technology). Anti-CAIX antibody was kindly provided by Professor S. Pastorekova (Slovak Academy of Sciences). Secondary antibody conjugates (anti-rabbit/anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase, 1:2,000, #7074 and #7076) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein loading was examined by either staining proteins with Coomassie Blue (Blue G, SERVA Electrophoresis) or with Fast Green (MERCK). Incubations with either staining agent were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Antibodies against housekeeping proteins were not used for this purpose, since they are not reliable markers for protein loading.ImmunocytochemistryImmunocytochemical analysis of formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded 3D cell aggregates was carried out as previously described.Growth/survival assaysIn 3D and high-density 2D cultures, the mass of living cells was determined by an ATP-based assay (Vialight Plus kit, Lonza). For spheroid formation in 3D suspension cultures, the cells were incubated in ultra-low attachment 96-well microplates (Corning) at a density of 5\u00d7103 cells/well. For incubation in high-density 2D cultures, the cells were seeded at a density of 1\u00d7104 per well (24-well plate). The cells were then exposed to fulvestrant and/or CAF-CM or left untreated for 3-7 days as indicated. Following the removal of the growth medium, the 2D-cultured cells were lysed by the addition of a mixture of 100 \u00b5l PBS and 50 \u00b5l lysis buffer to each well. After mixing 50 \u00b5l of the lysate with 50 \u00b5l luciferase stock solution, the luciferase activity was measured in a Sirius luminometer (Berthold). For measuring ATP in 3D-cultured cells, 50 \u00b5l of the lysis buffer was directly added to the 100-\u00b5l culture medium the cells were grown in. For examining cell growth in low-cell density 2D cultures, the cells were seeded at a density of 3\u00d7104 cells per \u00f8 10 cm dish. Following treatment either the average size (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells) or the average cell number (SKBR3 cells) of individual colonies was determined. Colony size was measured using an AxioCAM MRc5 camera and the AxioVision R 4.5 imaging software (Zeiss) as described previously. For each condition, 50 randomly selected colonies were examined. For measuring spheroid/aggregate size in 3D suspension cultures, the area occupied by the spheroid or aggregate was measured. Of note, some cell lines did not form regularly shaped spheroids. Instead they formed randomly clusters (T47D) or discs (MDA-MB-231, SKBR3) (data not shown).Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative (q)PCR were carried out as described previously. Briefly, NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey & Nagel) and Superscript II (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis, respectively. Following the addition of ABsolute qPCR SYBR-Green Fluorescein Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), qPCRs were run on a Bio-Rad iCycler and analyzed using iQ5 Optical System software version 2.1. Relative RNA levels of genes were calculated by the comparative Cq (2\u2212\u2206\u2206Cq) method using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine-guanine phos-phoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as reference genes for normalization. Primers for Bcl-3, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)18, GAPDH, HPRT, IGFBP5, kinesin family member 12 (KIF12), kelch like family member 4 (KLHL4), Kallikrein-11 (KLK11), RAB30, receptor activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3), selenoprotein P (SEPP1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor III (TGFBR3), transmembrane protein 26 (TMEM26), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15) and yippee like 1 (YPEL1) were as previously described. The primers used for the detection of aldehyde dehydroge-nase 1 family, member A1 (ALDH1A1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member A1 (ALDH3A1) and STAT3 were as follows: ALDH1A1 (forward 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, CAAAGAAGC TGCCGGGAAA and reverse 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, TCCAAGCTCCAGGGT CACC), ALDH3A1 (forward 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, GTCCCTGAGACCACG GAGC and reverse 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, CCCGTGTACAGGATATGGTCG) and STAT3 (forward 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, GGACAATATCATTGACCTTGT GAAAA and reverse 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, CTTCGTTCCAAAGGGCCAG).Antibody arrayTo identify proteins that are abundant in CAF-CM, the Human Obesity Antibody Array I (RayBiotech) was used, containing 62 different antibodies. Among the proteins, which can be detected by this array are a number of ILs, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and TGF\u03b2. The incubation of this array with CAF-CM and control medium/serum was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical analysesData obtained from colony growth assays were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by pairwise comparison with Bonferroni-corrected test. All other statistical analyses were carried out by using one-way ANOVA. The Bonferroni correction was applied for post-hoc analysis. A P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsIL-6 is a major mediator of the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression and phosphorylation in MCF-7 cellsBy selecting an antibody array that was able to detect the majority of factors reported to be secreted by CAFs, it was found that, in the CAF-CM preparations in this study, IL-6 was the most prominent component among other proteins [IL-8, CC-chemokine ligand (CCL)2 and CCL7, and tissue inhibitor of metallopro-teinases (TIMP)1 and TIMP3] (Fig. 1A).Of note, SDF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 could not be detected in considerable amounts. rhIL-6 was used to determine to which extent IL-6 is able to mimic the effects of CAF-CM on MCF-7 cells.rhIL-6 was as potent as CAF-CM in increasing Bcl-3 RNA and protein expression (Fig. 1B and C). Of note, several bands of Bcl-3 were visible in the western blot analysis, which likely represent Bcl-3 isoforms with a different phosphorylation status. In the CAF-CM-treated MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 expression is linked to IGFBP5 downregulation, and in rhIL-6-treated cells, STAT3 has been shown to drive Bcl-3 expression. In this study, rhIL-6 was found to be as capable as CAF-CM in activating STAT3 (Fig. 1C) and, above that, even increased STAT3 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). However, at 0.1 \u00b5g/ml, it failed to mimic the downregulating effect of CAF-CM on IGFBP5 expression (Fig. 1B). This suggests that, in contrast to CAF-CM, rhIL-6 upregulates Bcl-3 in MCF-7 cells through STAT3 and not through IGFBP5.The authors have previously reported that Bcl-3 modulates the expression of IGF1R and CAIX. The levels of both could be increased in a similar manner by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 1C). Another potential target of Bcl-3 is c-Myc, a mitogenic oncoprotein. After it was confirmed that c-Myc expression also depends on Bcl-3 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D), the effect of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 on the c-Myc level was examined. However, neither agent interfered with c-Myc expression (Fig. 1C) suggesting that the basal level of Bcl-3 is sufficient to maintain high c-Myc levels. It was also determined whether Bcl-3 modulates the expression of p50 (NF-\u03baB), a Bcl-3-binding transcription factor through which Bcl-3 activates transcription. However, p50 expression was not affected by Bcl-3 knockdown (Fig. 1D).Integrin \u03b21, another protein whose expression can be upregulated by CAF-CM, also exhibited a higher level in the presence of rhIL-6 (Fig. 1C). In addition, the RNA expression levels of the cancer stem cell markers, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 were increased in a similar manner by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 1E). However, rhIL-6 failed to increase AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In addition, it was not able to down-regulate a number of genes to the same extent as CAF-CM (Fig. 1F), whereby two of these genes (TMEM26 and YPEL1) exhibited no response to rhIL-6 at all. Of note, the 11 genes depicted in Fig. 1F shared the ability to react to inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway by increasing their expression (data not shown). This links the weaker effect of rhIL-6 on these genes to its inability to induce AKT phosphorylation.On the whole, these data demonstrate that rhIL-6 recapitulates a number of the effects of CAF-CM on RNA and protein expression in MCF-7 cells. However, it fails to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and has a weaker or no effect on a number of PI3K/AKT-responsive genes.rhIL-6 partly mimics CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 3D, but not in 2D culturesThe PI3K/AKT pathway and Bcl-3 play important roles in CAF-induced anti-estrogen resistance. The PI3K/AKT pathway is able to phosphorylate ER\u03b1 and restore ER\u03b1 activity in the presence of anti-estrogens. In addition, it increases Bcl-3 protein stability and fosters its nuclear localization. As demonstrated above, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased the expression of Bcl-3, but only CAF-CM was able to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. We therefore examined whether rhIL-6 is capable of inducing fulvestrant resistance to the same extent as CAF-CM. To this end, MCF-7 cells were grown in the absence and presence of fulvestrant for 5 or 7 days at high or low density, respectively, and the mass of viable cells was determined by an ATP/luciferase-based assay (high density) or average colony size (low density). In the absence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM negatively affected growth in high-density cultures and had a slight positive effect in low-density cultures, whereas rhIL-6 had no effect (Fig. 2A and B). In the presence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM potently increased cell mass both in low- and high-density cultures, whereas rhIL-6 had no effect at the concentration of 0.01 and 0.1 \u00b5g/ml, and slightly increased cell mass at 0.3 \u00b5g/ml. This indicates that, in contrast to CAF-CM, rhIL-6 is unable to induce fulvestrant resistance.To examine whether CAF-CM and rhIL-6 differently affect proliferation and/or apoptosis in the presence of fulvestrant, the proliferation marker Ki67 and the apoptosis marker cPARP, which is the 25-kDa fragment of cleaved PARP1, were analyzed. Both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased the Ki67 levels in the fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 cells and, along with this, abrogated the expression of cytoplasmic p21Waf1/Cip1, a marker of both senescence and apoptosis resistance. Unlike CAF-CM, rhIL-6 increased cPARP-1 expression (Fig. 2C). This suggests that, in contrast to CAF-CM, rhIL-6 exhibited pro-apoptotic activity in MCF-7 cells, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study demonstrating that, at 5 ng/ml, rhIL-6 induced apoptosis-linked DNA laddering in these cells. Along with the increased expression of cPARP-1, the level of ABCG2, a multidrug resistance protein acting as drug efflux pump, was found to be reduced (Fig. 2C). This suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of rhIL-6 is linked to a decline in the activity of ABCG2.Subsequently, it was determined whether the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in this process by using siRNA directed to the PI3K subunit p110\u03b1. This siRNA completely abolished p110\u03b1 expression and markedly reduced AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). It also potently increased cPARP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These data suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway is important for protecting MCF-7 cells against apoptosis and that ABCG2 plays a role in this process (Fig. 2D).These data suggest that, in the presence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM increased cell growth by stimulating proliferation. While rhIL-6 shares with CAF-CM the ability to stimulate proliferation, it also acts in a pro-apoptotic manner, which seems to lead to a steady state between proliferation and apoptosis and therefore prevents growth. The data further suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of rhIL-6 is linked to ABCG2 downregulation and its inability to raise AKT activity.The effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to fulvestrant in 3D spheroid cultures were then analyzied for two reasons. These culture conditions more likely resemble in vivo conditions and cells in 3D cultures react differently to external stimuli as compared to cells in 2D cultures. In 3D cultures, MCF-7 cells form regularly-shaped spheroids (Fig. S1A). Spheroid formation is complete after three days of incubation. Thereafter, the spheroids become larger (Fig. S1A), which coincides with cell growth (Fig. S1B) and a high expression of Ki67 (Fig. S1C). Later, growth ceases, possibly since cells die in the center of the spheroid, as indicated by cPARP-1 expression. In the presence of fulvestrant, cells form smaller spheroids, which later on appear disheveled (Fig. S1A). These morphological changes were accompanied by progressive cell death (Fig. S1B).To assess the effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 on spheroid-assembled MCF-7 cells, cell growth and spheroid size were measured. In the absence of fulvestrant, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 affected cell growth (Fig. 3A). In the presence of fulvestrant, both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased cell mass; however, the effect of CAF-CM was more potent (3.5- vs. 1.9-fold). The difference became even more pronounced, when the incubation time was extended to 11 days (5.5- vs. 2.4-fold) and 14 days (10- vs. 3.4-fold) (Fig. 3B). Spheroid size was increased by CAF-CM both in absence and presence of fulvestrant; however, rhIL-6 only weakly enlarged the spheroids in the absence of fulvestrant and had no effect on spheroid size in the presence of fulvestrant (Fig. 3C).These experiments were repeated with the AnD5 cell line. This MCF-7 subline forms smaller spheroids and develops them more rapidly than the parental MCF-7 cell line (data not shown). The results obtained with the AnD5 cells were similar to those obtained with the parental cell line, with the exception that, in the absence of fulvestrant, rhIL-6 affected spheroid size more potently than CAF-CM and that, in the presence of fulvestrant, rhIL-6 increased spheroid size, although still not as efficiently as CAF-CM (Fig. 3D and E).The examination of the Ki67 and cPARP-1 levels after 7 days of fulvestrant treatment revealed that the levels of both proteins were higher in the 3D cultures compared to their levels in 2D cultures, and that CAF-CM and rhIL-6 reduced the levels of both proteins (Fig. 3F). While the effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were similar on cPARP-1 expression, rhIL-6 had a more potent suppressive effect on Ki67 expression. These data suggest that, in 3D cultures, CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced fulvestrant resistance is based on their anti-apoptotic activities. The residual proliferative activity in the presence of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 may as well play a role. If so, the more potent suppressive effect of rhIL-6 on Ki67 expression may explain why rhIL-6 is not as effective as CAF-CM in inducing fulvestrant resistance. The examination of p-AKT and ABCG2 expression revealed that the anti-apoptotic effect of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 was not linked to these proteins. In the presence of CAF-CM and rhIL-6, the levels of both proteins were rather reduced (Fig. 3F). This suggests that, in 3D cultures, the PI3K/AKT pathway and ABCG2 are not involved in the regulation of apoptosis.Collectively, these data suggest that CAF-CM induces fulvestrant resistance in 2D and 3D cultures through different mechanisms, one by inducing proliferation, the other by inhibiting apoptosis, respectively. To a large extent, rhIL-6 was able to mimic the protective effect of CAF-CM against fulvestrant in 3D cultures, likely due to the fact that it was as able as CAF-CM to block apoptosis. By contrast, in 2D cultures, rhIL-6 shares with CAF-CM a mitogenic effect; however, by also acting in a pro-apoptotic manner under these culture conditions, it prevents cell growth and instead induces a steady-state between cell proliferation and cell death.rhIL-6 fails to induce fulvestrant resistance also in other ER\u03b1-positive cell lines in 2D culturesThe question of whether the findings that were obtained with the MCF-7 cells are also applicable for other ER\u03b1-positive cell lines was then examined. The BT474 and T47D cell lines were selected, which have been previously found by the authors to respond to CAF-CM, both in terms of protein expression patterns and survival in the presence of fulvestrant. Both cell lines exhibited an increased STAT3 phosphorylation in response to CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 4A and B). In the BT474 cells, both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 upregulated Bcl-3 expression, although the effect of rhIL-6 was more potent. In the T47D cells, only rhIL-6 increased the Bcl-3 level. In neither case was a gain in the Bcl-3 level accompanied by a substantial change in c-Myc or IGF1R expression; nor did CAIX expression increase to detectable levels (data not shown). In addition, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 upregulated the level of integrin \u03b21. Different effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were observed on cytoplasmic p21, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. In both cell lines, rhIL-6, but not CAF-CM, substantially increased the level of cytoplasmic p21, while CAF-CM, but not rhIL-6, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Importantly, as was observed with the MCF-7 cells, rhIL-6 also failed to mimic the positive effect of CAF-CM on AKT phosphorylation in BT474 cells.As was previously demonstrated, CAF-CM increased the resistance of BT474 and T47D cells to fulvestrant in 2D cultures (Fig. 4C and D), although these effects were not as potent as with the MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). Again, with rhIL-6, these results could not be reproduced.In the absence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM had no effect on BT474 cell growth, while it potently increased the growth of T47D cells. By contrast, rhIL-6 failed to mimic the growth-stimulatory effect on the T47D cells and even had a growth-inhibitory effect on BT474 cells (Fig. 4C and D).In 3D cultures, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 had a substantial effect on the growth of these cells (Fig. 4C and D). The spheroid size of the BT474 cells and aggregate size of the T47D cells (which do not form uniformly shaped spheroids) were affected by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in a similar manner. Both agents slightly reduced the average spheroid size of the BT474 cells and increased the average aggregate size of the T47D cells (Fig. 3E and F).Collectively, these data demonstrate that rhIL-6 also fails to mimic the growth-stimulatory effects of CAF-CM on BT474 and T47D cells in 2D cultures. In the case of the BT474 cells, this failure may again be linked to the inability of rhIL-6 to increase AKT phosphorylation. Additionally, cytoplasmic p21 may play a role, which was highly upregulated in both BT474 and T47D cells in response to rhIL-6, but not in response to CAF-CM.rhIL-6 mimics the majority of the growth-inhibitory effects of CAF-CM on ER\u03b1-negative cell linesFurthermore, ER\u03b1-negative cell lines (triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and Her2-positive SKBR3 cells) were analyzed. The lack of ER\u03b1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells and Her2 expression in SKBR3 cells were confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. S2). Of note, the MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a high basal activity of STAT3 (Fig. S2), which is the consequence of their high production of IL-6 and an IL-6/IL-6 receptor autocrine loop. This cell line also exhibited the highest basal level of integrin \u03b21 of all the cell lines tested (Fig. S2). However, due to their ER\u03b1 deficiency, no effect of fulvestrant on MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells was expected; for reasons of completeness, the analyses were also carried out in the presence of fulvestrant. In addition, since these cells grow rapidly, growth in 2D cultures was examined at a low density and either the average size of individual colonies (MDA-MB-231) or the average number per colony (SKBR3) was determined.Despite the high basal levels of p-STAT3 and integrin \u03b21 in the MDA-MB-231 cells, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were able to further upregulate the levels of both proteins in these cells (Fig. 5A). By contrast, none of the two agents induced Bcl-3 expression and both even negatively affected the expression of IGF1R and CAIX. In SKBR3 cells, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 similarly upregulated STAT3 phosphorylation, Bcl-3 and IGF1R expression, while only CAF-CM enhanced integrin \u03b21 expression (Fig. 5B). In both cell lines, CAF-CM increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and decreased total ERK1/2 levels, while having no effect on AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 5A and B). The effects on ERK1/2 were mimicked by rhIL-6 in the SKBR3, but not in the MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, in the SKBR3 cells, rhIL-6 increased AKT phosphorylation. Of note, in both cell lines, CAF-CM, as well as rhIL-6, potently decreased the expression of c-Myc.Cell growth analysis revealed that both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 reduced the growth of MDA-MB-231and SKBR3 cells in 2D cultures (Fig. 5C and D). With the SKBR3 cells, but not with the MDA-MB-231 cells, this growth-inhibitory effect was also observed in 3D cultures (Fig. 5E and F). In addition, the average sizes of the 3D SKBR3 cell aggregates decreased significantly, while the aggregates of the MDA-MB-231 cells, which form discs rather than spheroids (data not shown), remained unaltered (Fig. 5G and H). In general, the negative effects of CAF-CM on the growth of MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells were more potent than the corresponding effects of rhIL-6.Collectively, these data demonstrate that rhIL-6 also mimics the majority of the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells. rhIL-6 also shares the growth-inhibitory effects of CAF-CM on both cell lines, without being as potent as CAF-CM. The decline in growth activity may be linked to the potent reduction in c-Myc expression as inflicted by both agents in these cell lines. In the case of the MDA-MB-231 cells, additionally, the decline in IGF1R and CAIX may play a role here. c-Myc, IGF1R and CAIX have been reported to be key players driving MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.DiscussionThe findings of this study suggest that IL-6 is not only a major component of CAF-CM, but also mimics the majority of the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression in both ER\u03b1-positive and -negative breast cancer cells (Fig. 6). In agreement with previous reports that IL-6 is a classical activator of STAT3, this study found that an increase in the p-STAT3 level was a common response of all tested breast cancer cell lines to rhIL-6. This effect was also observed with CAF-CM, suggesting that IL-6 is the general mediator of the STAT3-activating effect of CAF-CM. In most cases, rhIL-6 also shared with CAF-CM the ability to increase the expression of Bcl-3. Bcl-3 gene expression can be upregulated by rhIL-6 through STAT3, which may suggest that the increase in STAT3 activity was responsible for the increase in Bcl-3 expression in response to rhIL-6 and CAF-CM. However, in MCF-7 cells, the CAF-CM-induced decrease in IGFBP5 expression was shown to be the major mediator of Bcl-3 upregulation. Since rhIL-6 had no effect on IGFBP5 expression at a lower concentration, it is likely that CAF-CM and rhIL-6 induced Bcl-3 expression through two different mechanisms: CAF-CM by decreasing IGFBP5 expression, rhIL-6 by upregulating STAT3 activity. A downregulatory effect of CAF-CM on the IGFBP5 level was as also observed in BT474 and SKBR3 cells (data not shown). RNA interference confirmed that, also in these cells, the downregulation of IGFBP5 caused an increase in Bcl-3 protein expression (data not shown). Of note, in MDA-MB-231 cells, IGFBP5 RNA was barely detectable (data not shown) and basal STAT3 activity was the highest of all cell lines tested (Fig. S2). In these cells, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 increased the Bcl-3 level.There were a number of other effects on protein expression shared by CAF-CM and rhIL-6, which may be related to their abilities to increase the p-STAT3 and Bcl-3 levels. Among these is IGF1R, a major driver of the PI3K pathway in MCF-7 cells and important for ER\u03b1-driven proliferation. In MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 mediates the CAF-CM-induced expression of IGF1R. In SKBR3 cells, the IGF1R levels were also found to increase along with Bcl-3. However, in BT474 and T47D cells, a higher Bcl-3 expression did not coincide with higher IGF1R levels and, in the MDA-MB-231 cells, the IGF1R level even decreased in response to CAF-CM and rhIL-6, while no change in Bcl-3 expression was observed. This suggests that IGF1R expression is regulated by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in an either Bcl-3-dependent or -independent manner. In tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells, the IGF1R promoter has been reported to be regulated by c-Myc. Hence, in MDA-MB-231 cells, the CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced loss of c-Myc may be responsible for the decrease in the IGF1R level. However, in the other cell lines tested, c-Myc expression was not associated with IGF1R expression. In MCF-7 cells, c-Myc expression was closely linked to Bcl-3 expression (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the observation that, in colon cancer cells, Bcl-3 increases the expression and stability of c-Myc. However, the CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced increase in Bcl-3 expression did not lead to a higher expression of c-Myc (Fig. 1C), arguing against the possibility that in MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 increased IGF1R expression indirectly through c-Myc.Another protein, whose expression was modulated by both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 was CAIX, which is important for the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 and, to a minor extent, also STAT3 contribute to the CAF-CM-induced increase in CAIX expression. The classical activator of CAIX expression is hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). CAF-CM has been shown to induce the expression of HIF1\u03b1 in MCF-7 cells under normoxic conditions, although not as potently as the hypoxia mimetic, CoCl2. NF-\u03baB, through which Bcl-3 activates genes, and STAT3 have been shown to be able to upregulate HIF1\u03b1 expression under normoxic conditions. In MDA-MB-231 cells, in which CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased the p-STAT3 level, while leaving the Bcl-3 level unaffected, CAIX expression decreased (Fig. 5A). This suggests that additional factors are involved in CAIX regulation. In the other cell lines tested, the CAIX levels were not detectable neither in the absence of CAF-CM or rhIL-6 (Fig. S2), nor in their presence (data not shown).Integrin \u03b21, a protein linked to anti-estrogen resistance, also exhibits a higher expression in response to CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in some of the breast cancer cell lines tested (MCF-7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231). The expression of both the slower migrating, N-glycosylated and the rapidly migrating, unglycosylated forms of integrin \u03b21 were similarly affected, suggesting that CAF-CM and rhIL-6 did not modulate the glycosylation of this protein. The regulation of integrin \u03b21 expression is not yet well understood. In MCF-7 cells, neither STAT3 nor Bcl-3 affect integrin \u03b21 expression positively and exhibit a rather downregulatory effect. The transcription factor, forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), has recently been identified as a potential regulator of integrin \u03b21 expression in TNBC cells. However, in SKBR3 cells, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 decreased the level of FoxM1 (data not shown), while CAF-CM increased the level of integrin \u03b21, and rhIL-6 did not affect integrin \u03b21 expression. This argues against an involvement of FoxM1 in CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced integrin \u03b21 expression. Another candidate that potentially may have contributed to the increase in integrin \u03b21 expression is TMEM26. Not only does its knockdown increase integrin \u03b21 expression, but CAF-CM also downregulated its expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, an inverse association between TMEM26 and integrin \u03b21 levels was also found with BT474 and SKBR3 cells (data not shown). Hence, a downregulated TMEM26 level may have contributed to the stimulatory effect of CAF-CM on integrin \u03b21 expression. However, it does not explain the effect of rhIL-6 on integrin \u03b21, as rhIL-6 fails to downregulate TMEM26 (Fig. 1F).Although rhIL-6 mimicked almost all the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression, in most cases, it failed to recapitulate the effects of CAF-CM on ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. In the BT474 and T47D cells, CAF-CM decreased and, in the MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells, it increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while, only in the SKBR3 cells, rhIL-6 was able to mimic the effect of CAF-CM. Likewise, CAF-CM, but not rhIL-6 increased the phosphorylation of AKT in the MCF-7 and BT474 cells. The failure of rhIL-6 (10 ng/ml) to modulate AKT and ERK1/2 activities in breast cancer cell lines has also been demonstrated by others.The failure to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway in MCF-7 and BT474 cells coincided with the inability of rhIL-6 to mimic CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 2D cultures. The authors demonstrate that, in MCF-7 cells, rhIL-6 induced apoptosis in 2D cultures, probably by downregulating ABCG2 expression, and that the apoptotic activity and ABCG2 expression are under the control of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This suggests a connection between the failure of rhIL-6 to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and its pro-apoptotic activity. Apart from stimulating apoptosis, rhIL-6 is as capable as CAF-CM in stimulating proliferation in the presence of fulvestrant. Hence, a likely scenario is that CAF-CM induces fulvestrant resistance by promoting proliferation, while rhIL-6 fails to foster growth in the presence of fulvestrant by causing a steady-state between cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. The PI3K/AKT pathway is not only important in regulating apoptosis, but is also able to phosphorylate ER\u03b1, thereby rendering the activity of ER\u03b1 independent of estrogen. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT pathway can activate Bcl-3. These PI3K/AKT pathway-related activities may as well play a role in CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance.CAF-CM also promoted the growth of T47D cells in the presence of fulvestrant. T47D cells differ from the MCF-7 and BT474 cells, as they exhibit a higher growth activity in response to CAF-CM also in the absence of fulvestrant. The effect on cell growth in the absence of fulvestrant was more potent than that in its presence. Neither of these effects were mimicked by rhIL-6. These findings are supported by those of other studies. It was previously demonstrated that co-cultures with CAFs upregulated the proliferation of T47D cells, whereas, at concentrations between 20 pg/ml and 100 ng/ml, rhIL-6 downregulated growth of these cells. The p-AKT levels did not differ in the presence of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 4B), ruling out the possibility that the PI3K/AKT pathway was involved. In addition, both agents upregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3, a factor that T47D cells rely on for growth, in a similar manner. However, unlike CAF-CM, rhIL-6 potently increased the expression of cytoplasmic p21 and Bcl-3 (Fig. 4B). The activation of NF-\u03baB, as can be induced by Bcl-3, can lead to the reduced growth of T47D cells. In addition, IKK\u03b2 (I\u03baB kinase \u03b2), which activates NF-\u03baB by triggering its dissociation from I\u03baB, was found to cause the cytoplasmic p21 level in breast cancer cells to rise. Since cytoplasmic p21 is associated with cellular senescence, rhIL-6 may have induced senescence through a Bcl-3/cytoplasmic p21 route. It should be noted that cytoplasmic p21 has also been linked to apoptosis protection. However, the data of this study suggest that, at least in MCF-7 cells, the cytoplasmic p21 level is an indicator of proliferative and not apoptotic activity (Fig. 2C).By summarizing the data on the growth activity of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells in 2D cultures, it becomes clear that all the growth-promoting effects of CAF-CM could not be recapitulated by rhIL-6 and must therefore be mediated by a CAF-CM component other than IL-6. By contrast, in 3D cultures, the growth-stimulatory effects of CAF-CM on MCF-7 and AnD5 cells in the presence of fulvestrant were mimicked by rhIL-6 to a large extent (Fig. 3A and B). Of note, the mechanism through which CAF-CM induces fulvestrant resistance differs between 2D and 3D cultures. In 2D cultures, CAF-CM promotes growth in the presence of fulvestrant by stimulating proliferation, whereas in 3D cultures this is achieved by the inhibition of apoptosis. rhIL-6 shares with CAF-CM the anti-apoptotic effect and is therefore also able to induce fulvestrant resistance in 3D cultures. Hence, there are opposite effects of rhIL-6 on apoptosis in 2D vs. 3D cultures, whereby the regulation of apoptosis in 2D cultures is dependent on the PI3K/AKT pathway, whereas, in 3D cultures, it is not. In contrast to 3D-cultured MCF-7 cells, neither the 3D-cultured BT474 nor 3D-cultured T47D cells responded to CAF-CM or rhIL-6 by a considerable change in growth activity. These data again emphasize that responses to external factors can be quite different between 2D and 3D cultures.In contrast to the ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cell lines tested, the ER\u03b1-negative cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 responded to CAF-CM in 2D cultures by a decrease in growth activity. The CAF-CM-treated SKBR3 cells also exhibited a lower growth activity in 3D cultures. Depending on the concentration used, all these growth-inhibitory actions were more or less mimicked by rhIL-6. Notably, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 potently decreased c-Myc expression in both cell lines. Since c-Myc is essential for cell cycling in MDA-MB-231, as well as in SKBR3 cells, the loss of c-Myc is the likely reason for the reduced growth activity as inflicted by CAF-CM and rhIL-6. The loss of c-Myc does not seem to be connected to Bcl-3. In the SKBR3 cells, the c-Myc levels were decreased, while the Bcl-3 levels were increased; in the MDA-MB-231 cells, the c-Myc levels decreased, while the Bcl-3 levels remained unaltered. In the MDA-MB-231 cells, the loss of c-Myc may be related to the decrease in the levels of IGF1R and CAIX, which are both important for MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.Differences in the reactivity to CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in terms of growth activity in 2D as opposed to 3D culture have also been found with MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating that ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells are react differently between 2D and 3D cultures. This was also shown in a previous study, in which the B-Raf inhibitor, RAF-265, was found to be more effective in inhibiting the growth of 3D-cultured than that of 2D-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells. Likewise, the growth inhibition of SKBR3 cells by the Her2 inhibitor, lapatinib, has been shown to be more pronounced in 3D as compared to 2D cultures.Although the stroma is the major source of IL-6 expression in primary breast cancers, breast cancer cells also secrete IL-6, whereby TNBC cells produce the highest amounts. For instance, MDA-MB-231 cells secrete a ~1,000-fold greater amount of IL-6 than MCF-7 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells use the endogenous production of IL-6 to stimulate a IL-6/IL-6 receptor loop for keeping STAT3 activity high. In fact, their p-STAT3 level was the highest of all p-STAT3 levels in the breast cancer cell lines we have tested (Fig. S2). Nevertheless, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were able to further increase STAT3 activity (Fig. 5A) suggesting that the amount of IL-6 they secrete does not reach the maximum concentration for optimal stimulation of STAT3 activity. The inhibition of the IL-6/IL-6R loop or STAT3 activity has been shown to lead to the decreased proliferation and the increased apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, the addition of rhIL-6 to MDA-MB-231 cells has been demonstrated to decrease proliferation, while not having any effect on apoptosis. In this study, rhIL-6 also acted growth-inhibitory on MDA-MB-231 cells in 2D cultures. As discussed above, the downregulation of the c-Myc, IGF1R and CAIX levels may be the reasons for the rhIL-6-induced growth inhibition.IL-6 plays a role in tissue remodeling and can stimulate both reprogramming and senescence. In this study, at the concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 \u00b5g/ml, rhIL-6 was found to recapitulate the effects of CAF-CM on the expression of CSC-related ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1E). This is in agreement with earlier findings indicating that 0.1 \u00b5g/ml rhIL-6 increased ALDEFLOUR activity in SUM159 cells.In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that, in all cell lines tested, CAF-CM component IL-6 mediates CAF-CM-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and the majority of the changes in protein expression pattern. However, almost all CAF-CM-induced alterations in ERK1/2 and AKT activities are not mediated by IL-6. The failure to activate AKT seems to be linked to its inability to mimic CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in common adherent 2D cultures. Yet, it likely mediates CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 3D cultures. This suggests that the ability of IL-6 to participate in the acquisition of fulvestrant resistance depends on culture conditions. Notably, IL-6 acts in a pro-apoptotic manner in 2D and in an anti-apoptotic manner in 3D cultures. Differences in the apoptotic activities of cells in 2D and 3D cultures have also been found by others. Tissue architecture has a potent effect on the behavior of cells. One reason may be that cells become polarized in 3D cultures, but not in 2D cultures. Given that cells in tissues are organized in three and not in two dimensions, the data obtained with 3D cultures are more likely to resemble the in vivo situation. The Kaplan-Meier-Plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&default=true) allows the assessment in-silico of the importance of IL-6 on the outcome of patients based on its mRNA level. Such a survival analysis of 494 ER\u03b1+/Her2\u2212 breast cancer samples for IL-6 mRNA revealed no significant difference in relapse-free survival at high and low levels of IL-6 mRNA (data not shown). However, IL-6 mRNA levels may not necessarily reflect the levels of secreted IL-6. Therefore, future studies on primary ER\u03b1+ breast cancer samples, comparing low and high IL-6 protein expresser, are warranted.Supplementary DataFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsAD performed most of the growth assays and RNA interference experiments and carried out Western blot analyses.

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse.

Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer.IntroductionRho GTPases belong to the Ras GTPase superfamily and in humans consists of about 20 members. Among them, RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42 are the most studied Rho GTPases. These GTPases act as intermediate signal transducers for a diverse array of cell surface receptors such as cytokine receptors, cadherins, integrins, GPCR, and tyrosine kinases, and therefore regulate major cellular events such as cell polarity, cell migration, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton rearrangements, vesicular trafficking, and gene expression. Aberrant Rho GTPase signaling results in neurological and immunological abnormalities, and malignant cell transformation.Like most other GTPases, RhoA and their activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), are commonly believed to be pro-proliferative and act as cancer oncogenes. The evidence for the oncogenic activity of RhoA was first reported using dominant negative and constitutively active RhoA mutants in fibroblasts. While activating RhoA mutants enhanced the transformation activity of a weakly oncogenic RAS mutant, a dominant negative RhoA mutant abrogated the oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation. Later, RhoA was reported to be overexpressed in several epithelial human cancer tissue samples including, breast, testicular, liver, colorectal, ovarian and gastric carcinoma.Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have identified hitherto undiscovered mutations in cancers and identified recurrent loss-of-function and gain-of-dominant-negative function mutations in RhoA in lymphoma, leukemia and several solid tumors. These latest discoveries, therefore, suggested a possible tumor suppressor function for RhoA in cancers. Indeed, studies with mouse models have demonstrated the tumorigenic and metastatic functions of the identified RhoA dominant-negative alleles in colorectal cancer.In addition, analysis of the RNA-seq data generated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project revealed high expression of several RhoGAP genes, which are the upstream negative regulators of RhoA, in basal-like breast cancer tumors raising the possibility that RhoGAPs are oncogenic. The oncogenic role of a RhoGAP named ARHGAP18 in breast cancer was subsequently proven with mouse transplantation model. Importantly, ARHGAP18 was shown to enhance metastasis partly by inactivating RhoA.Although these recent advances in the field support a tumor suppressive role for RhoA, a comprehensive mechanistic analysis on altered RhoA expression in primary tumors and its subsequent effects on tumor microenvironment and metastasis is lacking. In this study, using the highly metastatic 4T1 orthotopic mouse model, which closely resembles the human triple negative breast cancer, we show that downregulation of RhoA expression increases breast cancer lung metastasis. Mechanistically our study suggests that by increasing the expression of chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, decreased RhoA expression increases the proclivity of cancer cells for the sentinel lymph node and enables the cancer cells to have access to the circulation and metastasize.ResultsRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitroRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitro.

Although early work suggested a potential oncogenic role for RhoA, numerous recent studies start to challenge this notion. To further investigate the role of RhoA in breast cancer, we stably down-regulated RhoA expression by lentiviral transduction of specific shRNAs (Fig.\u00a01a) and measured the effects of the RhoA knockdown on cancer cells proliferation and invasion. Two different triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBC) were used to ensure the observed effects were not cell type specific. While reduced RhoA expression significantly increased breast cancer cells invasion through Matrigel (Fig.\u00a01b), it did not have a noticeable effect on cell proliferation as measured by two different assays (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). As a positive control for our proliferation assay, we treated breast cancer cells with a selective MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, and observed an expected near-complete suppression on colony formation in clonogenic growth assay (Fig.\u00a01c).We reasoned that if the effect of RhoA knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion is RhoA specific and physiologically relevant, we would expect to observe the opposite effect when RhoA expression or activity is increased. Indeed, stable expression of a constitutively active RhoA variant, RhoAQ63L, in both BT20 and MDA-MB231 considerably decreased their proclivity to invade (Fig.\u00a01d). Together, these results suggested that in breast cancer cells, RhoA suppresses cell invasiveness.RhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in miceRhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in mice.

Metastasis is a complex multimodal activity that involves both host and tumor cells and can only be adequately addressed with an animal model. To investigate the possible role of RhoA in breast cancer metastasis, we exploited the well-established 4T1 syngeneic murine breast cancer model. The 4T1 TNBC cell line was originally derived from a spontaneous mammary tumor in a Balb/c mouse. Hence, it is widely utilized for syngeneic orthotopic mammary tumor allograft experiments. We generated a panel of lentiviral-mediated stable RhoA knockdowns in 4T1 cells with different levels of knockdowns, and used two of them, with a 30% (shRhoA 34) and a 50% (shRhoA 32) knockdown, for subsequent experiments (Fig.\u00a02a). Concurring with human breast cancer cells results, reduced RhoA expression significantly increased 4T1 cells invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a02b). Significantly, similar effects were observed with stable expression of a dominant negative RhoAT19N, but the opposite effect was observed when the constitutively active RhoAQ63L was expressed in 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Collectively, these findings strongly suggested that the mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells could be used to investigate the role of RhoA in metastasis.To address this question, we first engineered 4T1 cells to express a GFP-LUC hybrid protein to allow the growth and metastasis of the tumor to be monitored by luciferase bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Upon orthotopic implantation of 4T1 cells, all mice in RhoA knockdown and control groups developed primary tumors. In accord with our in vitro findings where RhoA knockdown did not influence breast cancer cell proliferation, at 30 days post-implantation we did not observe any statistically significant changes in weights or expression levels of proliferation antigen ki67 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors when compared with knockdown control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors as well (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). On the contrary, bioluminescent imaging of mice at 29 days post-implantation revealed possible distant metastases in mice implanted with the highest RhoA knockdown (shRhoA 32) 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02d) showing a dose-dependent effect of RhoA knockdown on cancer metastasis. Indeed, mice implanted with shRhoA 32 knockdown 4T1 cells exhibited a significantly higher lung metastasis burden compared to other groups during histology analysis (Fig.\u00a02e,f). In a complementary approach, we also down regulated the activity of RhoA in 4T1 cells by stably expressing the dominant negative RhoAT19N allele. Significantly, expression of RhoAT19N had the same effect on lung metastasis as the knockdown of RhoA expression in 4T1 cells and with a minimal effect on tumor weights (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Collectively, these findings suggested that RhoA could act as a physiological suppressor of breast cancer lung metastasis in mice.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in miceIt has been thought that invasive breast cancer cells from the primary tumor gain access to the systemic circulation through intra-tumoral and peripheral blood vasculature. However, with novel and more sensitive research technologies, scientists have identified that for breast cancer, the major systemic metastasis route is through the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Once tumor cells reach the SLN, they can access the systemic circulation directly without first passing down to the next lymph node.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in mice.

N\u2009=\u20093, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).It is possible that RhoA suppresses the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells by interfering with the access of the cancer cells to the SLN. To examine this possibility, four weeks after implantation, we harvested the draining/sentinel lymph nodes (right axillary LN) from the cancer cells injected sites and processed them for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. As a control, we also harvested lymph nodes (left inguinal LN) on the contralateral side of the primary tumor. IHC analysis of the SLNs with an epithelial cell specific CK8 antibody revealed that the shRhoA 32 knockdown group mice have higher CK8 staining compared to the control mice, while no statistical significance in CK8 staining in the inguinal lymph nodes was observed between RhoA knockdown and control knockdown mice (Fig.\u00a03a). Similar results were observed with a GFP antibody, which specifically stained the 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a03b). Collectively, these observations suggested that when the RhoA expression is reduced, invasive 4T1 cells reached the axillary sentinel lymph node more efficiently than the control cells and readily gain access to the systemic circulation for spreading into other organs including the lungs.Metastasis is a complex multiple-step process. In addition to invading the draining lymph node and entering the circulation, the circulating cancer cells must survive the hostile environmental conditions inside the blood vessels until extravasating into a distant tissue for metastatic colonization. To investigate whether RhoA also suppresses the later steps of the metastasis cascade, we tail-vein injected RhoA knockdown or control knockdown 4T1 GFP-LUC cells in Balb/c mice to bypass the early stages of metastasis. Mice were monitored at days 1, 7 and 14 post-injection for lung tumor burden by bioluminescent imaging. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c,d, both the kinetics of lung tumor formation and extent of the tumor burden showed no significant difference between RhoA knockdown and control group mice suggesting that RhoA may not have a role in cancer cell extravasation and colonization.RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion by modulating the tumor microenvironmentRhoA modulates the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in breast tumors.

It is possible that reduced RhoA expression promotes cancer cell dissemination into sentinel lymph nodes by modulating this dynamic interplay. To investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the major TME components in the control and RhoA knockdown primary tumors harvested from the Balb/c mice 30 days after the orthotopic implantation. TME is mainly composed of activated fibroblasts called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), adaptive and innate immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells. We examined the presence of vascular endothelial cells, CAFs, B-lymphocytes and macrophages in these primary tumors by IHC staining with CD31, \u03b1-SMA, CD19, and F4/80 specific antibodies, respectively. Though no differences were detected in CD31 and CD19 expression between the two groups, a significant elevation was detected in \u03b1-SMA and F4/80 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors compared to control tumors, suggesting an increased infiltration of CAFs and macrophages in RhoA knockdown tumors, respectively (Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03).CAFs are known to drive the tumorigenesis and metastasis phenotype by secreting pro-tumorigenic chemokines, and by enhancing tumor stiffness. While we did not detect any significant differences in collagen content/fibrosis between control and RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, IHC staining with pro-tumorigenic chemokine CXCL12 specific antibody revealed that RhoA knockdown tumors are significantly enriched in CXCL12 expression (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). To identify the source of CXCL12 in the TME, we double-stained the RhoA knockdown tumors with \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 antibodies. We observed that the CXCL12 staining was predominantly co-localized with the staining of \u03b1-SMA suggesting that CXCL12 detected in the TME was mainly secreted by the infiltrated CAFs (Fig.\u00a04c). In agreement with this line of thinking, we failed to detect the expression of CXCL12 in 4T1 cells by qRT-PCR (data not shown). The predominant receptor for CXCL12 is CXCR4. As expected, the expression levels of CXCR4 were also enhanced in RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by IHC staining and qRT-PCR RNA analysis (Fig.\u00a04d,e). Apparently, the enhanced CXCR4 expression is an autonomous effect of the downregulation of RhoA expression in 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04e).RhoA modulates the CCR5-CCL5 axis in breast tumors.

N\u2009=\u20094, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were shown to promote tumor progression, angiogenesis and lung metastasis in several breast cancer in vivo studies, and associated with poor patient survival. During tumor progression, secretion of tumor-derived chemoattractant chemokines leads to the recruitment of circulating monocytes into breast tumors. The infiltrated monocytes will subsequently differentiate into tumor associated-macrophages. It is possible that the increased number of TAMs is a consequence of increased expression of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors. Truly, RhoA knockdown tumors were significantly enriched in CCL5 expression (Fig.\u00a05a). In addition to secreting CXCL12, CAFs have also been shown to be a key source of CCL5 in tumors. Indeed, CAFs but not the cancer cells, are the major contributors of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors as assessed by immunofluorescent staining and qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a05b,c).Paracrine activities of intra-tumoral CCL5 through its cognate receptor CCR5 are reported to promote breast tumor progression, and LN and thoracic metastasis. It is possible that the observed increase in LN and lung metastases in RhoA knockdown mice is caused by activated CCL5-CCR5 signaling in primary tumors. In agreement with this line of reasoning, we observed the expression levels of CCR5 were increased in RhoA knockdown tumors and the increased CCR5 expression levels are partly due to an increase in CCR5 transcripts in cancer cells (Fig.\u00a05d,e).DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the role of RhoA in breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Stable knockdown of RhoA expression had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation but increased in vitro cell invasion and metastasis. The reported effects of RhoA shRNA-mediated knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro are mixed. While we and others observed that RhoA has an anti-invasive role, published reports indicating that RhoA has a pro-invasive role in breast cancer exist. At present, the mechanism of how RhoA can have opposite effects on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro is not known. RhoA GTPase has several downstream effectors and some of them reported to have opposing effects on cancer cells invasion. Therefore, it is plausible that, depending on the experimental conditions, knocking down the expression of RhoA can have preferred effects on certain downstream RhoA effectors. However, despite the described opposite effects of RhoA on in vitro breast cancer cells invasion, the effects of specific RhoA shRNA knockdown on breast cancer metastasis has never been formally addressed with an orthotopic transplantation immune-competent mouse model until now. The results of our in vitro invasion assays align rightly with the in vivo mouse experiments strongly suggesting the causal role of RhoA as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor. Among the various effectors, mDia and ROCK are two best-described effectors that are important for RhoA-mediated regulation of cancer cell invasion/metastasis by stabilizing adherens junctions, regulating myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation and focal adhesion dynamics. It remains to be determined if RhoA inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis by targeting adherens junctions, MLC2 phosphorylation, and/or focal adhesions.In addition to cancer cell-autonomous functions, continuous heterotypic communications between cancer cells, ECM, and their surrounding non-malignant cells are also vital for disease progression and metastatic dissemination. Fibroblasts are the most common non-malignant cells in the tumor. In normal tissues, they usually exist in a resting/quiescent state and are activated in response to a plethora of signaling cues. Activated fibroblasts are highly proliferative and metabolically active and identified by their expression of markers like \u03b1-SMA and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Activated fibroblasts in tumor stroma are termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally pro-tumorigenic with a dynamic and complex secretory phenotype including ECM molecules (tenascin C, collagen), growth factors (VEGFA, PDGF, HGF), cytokines, and chemokines (TNF, IFN\u03b3, CXCL12, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8). Using the 4T1 triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we observed an inverse correlation between RhoA expression and infiltration of \u03b1-SMA positive CAFs. Consistent with increased infiltrated CAFs, RhoA knockdown tumors were also highly enriched with CAFs-secreted CXCL12. The reduced RhoA activity resulted in increased expression of the cognate receptor, CXCR4, for CXCL12 in 4T1 cancer cells.CAFs-secreted CXCL12 drives tumor progression and metastasis through two possible mechanisms. It mediates the chemotactic recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to promote tumor angiogenesis. It may also enhance the invasive capacity of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells through paracrine stimulation. Since RhoA knockdown had no observable effect on tumor angiogenesis, it is possible that the increased CXCL12 expression might drive the paracrine stimulation of the RhoA knockdown cancer cells\u2019 invasiveness. Therefore, our study suggests that RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell metastatic dissemination by suppressing the invasiveness of tumor cells through reduced expression of the tumor CXCR4 receptor with a subsequent reduction of CAFs in the TME.Similarly, RhoA knockdown primary tumors displayed a significant F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration. This was correlated with an increased expression of stromal-derived CCL5, a well-established chemokine important in recruiting and converting CCR5 positive monocytes into TAMs. In addition to CCR5, monocytes also express CCR2, which is the main receptor for another important immune cell recruiting chemokine CCL2. The expression of CCR5, the cognate receptor for CCL5 was likewise found to be upregulated in RhoA knockdown 4T1 cancer cells. However, the effects of RhoA knockdown on CCR2 expression is not as significant as the effects on CCR5 (unpublished results). It is therefore possible that the upregulation of CCR5 but not CCR2 expression is the major cause of increased F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration in RhoA knockdown tumors. In addition to CXCL12, CAFs were also a source of increased CCL5 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors. It is therefore likely that the increased co-expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in RhoA knockdown cancer cells facilitates the recruitment of CXCL12/CCL5 secreting CAFs and later the TAMs into the TME. Like CAFs, TAMs have been shown to be pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic. Since RhoA knockdown tumors with significant CAFs and TAMs infiltration showed relatively increased lymph node and lung metastases formation, it is therefore possible that reduced RhoA activity in tumor cells promotes its metastatic dissemination by activating both the CXCL12-CXCR4 and CCL5-CCR5 signaling pathways.Metastatic dissemination and distant colonization are inefficient processes with multiple sequential steps. The systemic metastasis of breast cancer was long thought to be through the intratumoral and peritumoral blood vasculature, even though lymph node metastasis was often associated with tumor aggressiveness and poorer prognosis. It was long believed that LN metastases enter systemic circulation by traveling from SLN to the next through efferent lymphatics until they drain into the thoracic duct and through the neck lympho-vascular anastomosis into the internal jugular vein. However, recent studies using intravital imaging, photo-switchable protein, and cancer cell micro-infusion showed that cancer cells in the SLN are a significant source for distant lung metastases and lymph node-residing tumor cells disseminate by efficiently invading LN blood vasculature rather than by transiting through efferent lymphatic vessels. In the present study, we detected more cancer cells in the SLNs but not in the contralateral lymph nodes of RhoA knockdown mice compared to the control group. Cancer cells tail-vein injection experiments designed to bypass the early steps revealed no difference in cancer cells extravasation and lung colonization between RhoA knockdown and control groups. Taken together, our study suggest that RhoA suppresses the cancer cells\u2019 initial steps of local invasion into SLNs, and subsequent intravasation into LN blood vasculature while has no observable role in the later steps of the metastasis cascade.Knockdown of RhoA expression increases CCR5 and CXCR4 transcripts in 4T1 cancer cells suggesting a possible transcription-regulatory function of RhoA. RhoA GTPases are known for its functions in cytoskeleton dynamics, regulating cell polarity and cell migration and cell cycle progression. However, a lesser-known function of RhoA is its ability to regulate several transcriptional signaling pathways such as NF\u03baB signaling, GATA-4 signaling, CREB signaling, STAT5a signaling and AP-1 signaling. Rho regulates the transcriptional activity of NF\u03baB by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and in breast and prostate cancer cells, NF\u03baB directly upregulates CXCR4 mRNA expression and stability. Although NF-\u03baB has a stimulatory role in regulating chemokines expression in general, it is still conceivable that RhoA negatively regulates NF-\u03baB by decreasing the expression of coactivators required for optimal activity of NF-\u03baB. Similarly, it was also reported that Rho GTPases could modulate the activity of CREB, and CCR5 is a well-established transcriptional target of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Therefore, it is possible that RhoA suppresses CCR5 and CXCR4 expression by impinging on one or more of these transcriptional signaling pathways. In a recent study, Georgouli et al. reported the pivotal role of RhoA-ROCK signaling in driving fast rounded-amoeboid migration in cancer cells during metastasis in a melanoma mouse model. Mechanistically upregulation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in melanoma cancer cells stimulates the transcription and secretion of an entire cytokine transcriptional program that controls immune cell recruitment into the tumor environment. At present, it is not clear whether the pro-metastatic effect of RhoA is RhoA-effector or cancer type specific.In summary, using a triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that reduced RhoA expression increases breast cancer lymph node and lung metastasis. Potential tumor and metastasis suppressive ability of RhoA in breast cancer have been suggested before. But the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased CAF and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes at the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer, shows the ability of RhoA to suppresses chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells, in turn suppressing the breast cancer LN and lung metastasis.Materials and MethodsCell cultureBT20 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, HyClone, UT, USA) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, GA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone), and the 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line was cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS, 5% calf serum (Lonza, Switzerland) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. The expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)\u2014that are collectively named hormone receptors (HR)\u2014human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and of the proliferation marker, Ki67, defines BC subtypes which are categorized into: Lumina A (HR+, HER2-), Luminal B (HR+, HER2+ or HR+, HER2-; Ki67 high), HER2-enriched (HR-, HER2+), and Triple-Negative (TN: HR-, HER2-). The majority of TNBCs belongs to the basal-like subtype and displays a highly aggressive phenotype with poorer overall survival and high relapse rates. Although TNBC can show an initial good response to chemotherapies, it frequently develops resistance and, due to the limitations of available targeted therapies, it still represents a deadly disease.The association between inflammation and cancer is unquestionable since chronic inflammation frequently predisposes cells to oncogenic transformation. A key mediator of the anti-inflammatory response is the 37 kDa phospholipid-binding protein Annexin A1 (AnxA1). In addition to regulating membrane trafficking, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, AnxA1 inhibits Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the cytoplasm and impedes the release of arachidonic acid, which is a key contributor to the development of the tumor microenvironment (TME). AnxA1 also elicits, upon its secretion, the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) signaling pathway that is responsible for inhibiting leukocyte adhesion and migration. Therefore, AnxA1 is a pleiotropic protein with effects beyond the immune system and is implicated in the promotion and progression of different diseases.In the last decade, researchers have focused on the correlation between AnxA1 and the aggressiveness of different tumors. In BC context, higher expression levels of AnxA1 have been described for the TNBC subtype and the role of this protein in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC has also been depicted. AnxA1 can be found in cytoplasm, nuclei and supernatants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB231, in its 37 kDa intact form and in its cleaved form of 33 kDa. Notably, findings showed that the intact form displays anti-inflammatory activity while its cleaved form seems to be pro-inflammatory. Interestingly, previous works showed an association between AnxA1 and the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. On one side, it has been demonstrated that IL-6 stimulates the upregulation and secretion of AnxA1 by acting on an IL-6 responsive region within the AnxA1 promoter. On the other side, it has been demonstrated that AnxA1 signaling through FPR2 inhibits the IL-6 expression in neutrophils and that AnxA1 signaling through FPR1 inhibits the IL-6 expression in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231.IL-6 is one of the main mediators of the inflammatory response with an important role in host immune defense mechanisms and in the modulation of cellular growth. IL-6 signals through a cell-surface receptor, the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and through a soluble form of IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), leading to the activation of the transcription factor STAT3. IL-6 modulates the proliferation and differentiation of malignant cells and its expression is frequently increased in different tumors including prostate cancer and BC. In BC, the overexpression of both IL-6 and IL-6 receptors (IL-6R and sIL-6R) was observed and high serum levels of IL-6 have been correlated with a poorer prognosis and metastasis to bones. Moreover, the IL-6 expression levels are significantly higher in the basal-like BC phenotype and in multi drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Similar findings were observed for STAT3 whose overexpression levels correlate with poorer survival rates in patients with solid tumors and with the resistance of cancer cells towards chemotherapy. In BC, STAT3 stimulates proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, chemoresistance and promotes EMT and metastasis.In this work, we describe the functional interaction between AnxA1 and IL-6 in BC and unravel how this interaction could maintain the malignant phenotype of TNBCs. By using tissue microarrays (TMAs) and BC cell lines, we observed that AnxA1 expression correlates with the expression of IL-6. TNBC cells are characterized for high levels of both AnxA1 and IL-6 and for the activation of an autocrine signaling by AnxA1. We found that IL-6 increased AnxA1 externalization and, in this way, supported the AnxA1 autocrine signaling cascade through the activation of FPR1 in TNBC cell lines. When FPR1 was inhibited in TNBC cells, the expression levels of IL-6 were increased as an attempt to sustain the autocrine signaling of AnxA1. We also demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, Tocilizumab (TCZ), inhibited the in vivo growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors in mice, reducing metastasis formation. Lastly, supernatants derived from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells previously treated with inhibitors of FPR1 and/or IL-6 influenced the motility of fibroblast cells. Taken together, our data suggest that in aggressive BCs, the AnxA1 and IL-6 signaling pathway cascades are linked by a biunivocal compensatory relation.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Culture and TreatmentsThe non-tumorigenic human breast cell line, MCF-10A, and the human BC cell lines, MCF-7 (ER+, PR+), MDA-MB-453 (HER2+), MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-459 (TNBC cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All the BC cell lines were cultured in IMDM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dallas, TX, USA) while MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with EGF (20 ng/mL), hydrocortisone (0.5 \u00b5g/mL), cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), and insulin (10 \u00b5g/mL) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fibroblast cells (HFF) were cultured in RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All media were supplemented with 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1\u00d7 antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cells were free from mycoplasma and were authenticated through STR analysis.Cells were treated with the following chemicals and antibodies diluted in serum-free medium: FPR antagonist Cyclosporin H (CsH-Sigma, used at 1 \u00b5M), neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody (Tocilizumab Actemra, Roche, used at 2 \u00b5g/mL), STATTIC (STC-Sigma 1 and 5 \u00b5M) and recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6, Thermo Fisher Scientific, used at 1 \u00b5g/mL).2.2. Cell Lysis and ImmunoblottingNuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts of 24 h-treated cells were prepared by using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce\u2122 BCA\u2122 ProteinAssay; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Identical amounts of protein extracts and supernatants were separated electrophoretically on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Membranes were blocked with PBS 5% milk for 1 h and subsequently incubated with anti-AnxA1 (1:2000; 71-3400; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Anti-\u03b2-Actin (1:1000, SC-130656; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and anti-Lamin B2 (1:1000, SAB2702205, Sigma) were used as loading controls of cytoplasmic and nuclear extract, respectively. As a secondary antibody, the anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (1:3000; G21234; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used.2.3. Flow CytometryTo analyze the activation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 and the expression levels of FPR1 and FPR2, cells were fixed and permeabilized by BD Cytofix/Cytoperm\u2122 Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA). Subsequently, cells were stained with anti-ERK1 (1:100; (phospho T202/Y204) + ERK2 (phospho T185/Y187); ab32538, Abcam)); anti-STAT3 (1:100; phospho Y705 AF4607; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA); anti-FPR1 FITC-conjugated (1:50; FAB3744F; R&D Systems); and anti-FPR2 PE-conjugated (1:50; FAB3479P; R&D Systems). Anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:200, 656111, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a secondary antibody for ERK1/2 and STAT3 staining. The isotype controls for FPR1 ((anti-mouse IgG2A-FITC control) 1:50; IC003F; R&D Systems) and FPR2 ((anti-mouse IgG2B-PE control) 1:50; IC0041P, R&D Systems) were also used.2.4. Calcium FluxIn order to assess the intracellular calcium increase, cells were treated for 24 h with STC, TCZ, CsH, or rIL-6. The next day, cells were treated for an additional hour, washed with Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), and incubated with a mixture of the Fluo4 AM calcium dye and Pluronic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. Cells were washed twice with HBSS to remove the unloaded dye. A standard curve of calcium was prepared in HBSS buffer without calcium. The cytosolic calcium in samples was measured by using a fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using excitation.2.5. ImmunohistochemistryTissue microarray (TMA) slides containing samples of 1 mm diameter and 1 \u00b5M thickness of BC primary tumors (US Biomax BR1503d) were used. All samples were clinicopathologically characterized according to Scarff Bloom-Richardson grading, TNM staging system and ER, PR and HER2 status.TMA slides were incubated for 16 h with anti-IL-6 (Thermoscientific AHC0762) or anti-AnxA1 (71-3400; Thermoscientific) at 1:20 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively, and subsequently incubated with Novolink\u2122 Max Polymer Detection System (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK) with HRP polymer (HRP Multimer). Next, the reactions were developed with diaminobenzidine substrate solution (DAB, Sigma). The slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Dinamica Quimica Comtemporanea, Indaiatuba, SP, Brazil), mounted on Tissue-Tek film (Sakura), and digitalized by using the Aperio ScanScope XT digital scanner (Leyca Biosystems, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using the PixelCount V9.0 algorithm.2.6. In Vivo AssayThe Ethics Committee of the Institutional Research Board of the AC Camargo Cancer Center approved all procedures involving mice, under the number 072/2015. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.Female athymic nude mice (2\u20134 months old) were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 \u00d7 106 MDA-MB-231-Luc cells. After tumors reached 300 mm3, animals were randomized into two groups. The treatments were carried out intraperitoneally with PBS + DMSO 5% (group control, n = 11) or with TCZ 10 mg/kg (n = 7) three times a week for 1 month or if tumors reached 1000 mm3. After treatments, tumors were resected, and metastases were monitored in vivo by whole animal imaging with bioluminescence (IN-VIVO FX Pro, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).2.7. Wound-Healing AssayCell migration was measured by in vitro wound-healing assay. Briefly, by using a pipette tip, wounds on HFF cell monolayers were created. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and treated with mitomycin C (Sigma, used at 10 \u00b5g/mL) to inhibit mitosis. Afterwards, cells were treated with supernatants of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells not treated or treated with 1 \u00b5M CsH, 2 \u00b5g/mL of TCZ, 5 \u00b5M STC and 1 \u00b5g/mL of rIL-6. Pictures of the wounds (10\u00d7) were taken at times 0 and 24 h (EVOS, AMG). By comparing the gap at times 0 and 24 h, the percentages of gap closure were obtained.2.8. ELISAIL-6 expression was analyzed by ELISA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in supernatants from the human BC cell lines. TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were treated or not for 24 h with STC, TCZ, CsH or rIL-6 in serum-free medium.2.9. Quantitative Real-Time PCRTotal RNAs from the breast cell lines were extracted using Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The RNA concentration and quality were analyzed spectrophotometrically by absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm, and 1 \u03bcg was used to synthesize cDNA using GoScript Reverse Transcription Mix, Oligo(dT) (Promega; Madison, WI, USA), following the supplier\u2019s instructions.The real-time PCR (qPCR) was conducted in an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 5.0 \u03bcL of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 \u03bcM of primers designed for ANXA1 (5\u2032-GATTCAGATGCCAGGGCCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATCCACAACTTCGCAGAGTG-3\u2032), IL-6 (5\u2032-AACCACGGCCTTCCCTACTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAGTTGTGCAATGGCAATTCTG-3\u2032) and STAT3 (5\u2032-CCAGTTTACCACGAAAGTCAGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AAAGACTCTGGGGATGTTGCTG-3\u2032). Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene was used as reference for relative quantification and the primers were published previously. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 60 s. Each sample was tested in triplicate and mRNA relative levels were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Cq method. \u03b22M mRNA levels did not differ across samples.2.10. AnxA1 KnockdownLentiviral particles encoding a scrambled shRNA sequence (1.0 \u00d7 105 IFU; shControl, sc-108080, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a pool of lentiviral particles encoding four shRNAs specific for AnxA1 knockdown (1.0 \u00d7 105 IFU; shAnxA1, sc-29198, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transduced in MDA-MB-231 cells through a previous incubation with Polybrene at 5 \u03bcg/mL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by infection with the virus particles. Clones of cells expressing the shAnxA1 were selected by using 5 \u03bcg/mL of puromycin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).2.11. Statistical AnalysisThe Student\u2019s t test was used to analyze significant differences between means. Correlations were calculated by Pearson\u2019s coefficient, McNemar test and Odds ratios (OR). OR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05. The statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA).3. Results3.1. Correlation between AnxA1 and IL-6 Expression in BC SamplesA total of 106 patients were included in this study. The patients\u2019 average age was 50.8 years, ranging from 28 to 80 years. ER was expressed in 41 (38.7%) patients, PR was expressed in 28 patients (26.4%), and HER2 was expressed in 39 patients (36.8%). In addition, breast tumors were classified according to their molecular subtypes: 37 Luminal A (35%), 11 Luminal B (10.4%), 26 HER2-enriched (24.5%); and 32 patients were defined as TNBC (30.1%). No axillary lymph node involvement was observed in 37 patients (34.9%), while in 69 patients, one or two (N1-2) lymph node metastases were identified (65.1%). The distribution based on tumor size was as follows: T1, 6 (5.7%); T2, 73 (68.9%); T3, 19 (17.9%) and T4, 8 (7.5%). The distribution by stage was stage I, 3 patients (2.8%); stage II, 73 (68.9%); and stage III, 30 (28.3%). For histological grading of tumors, 11 samples (10.4%) were GI; 82 (77.3%) GII, and 13 (12.3%) GIII.Samples have been analyzed for the expression of AnxA1 and IL-6 and as a control of the staining a TNBC sample has been incubated with all reagents but no primary antibody (Figure S1). We found that in adjacent non-tumor breast tissues, both AnxA1 and IL-6 were expressed in glandular and in the myoepithelial cell layer. AnxA1 and IL-6 were weakly expressed in the Luminal subtype, while moderately expressed in the HER2-enriched subtype and highly expressed in the TNBC subtype (Figure 1A). We also found a positive correlation using the Person\u2019s test and linear regression between AnxA1 and IL-6 (Figure 1B; R = 0.98 and R2 = 0.96 and p > 0.00001).In order to differentiate the expression of AnxA1 and IL-6 proteins according to clinicopathological data, samples were categorized into two groups (high and low) and analyzed using the Odds ratio test. With the aid of the pathologist\u2019s visual score, we chose Iavg (Iavg: average intensity of all pixels) cut-off of 166.7 for IL-6 and 175.0 for AnxA1. The AnxA1 expression was 3.3 higher in TNBC when compared to other subtypes (Table 1; OR = 3.3; p = 0.007). Already, the IL-6 expression was lower in samples classified as N1 and N2 (Table 1; OR = 0.3; p = 0.003) and IL-6 was 2.6-fold less expressed in BC samples when they were not classified as Luminal A (Table 1; OR = 2.6; p = 0.03).To conclude, it was possible to infer that the AnxA1 expression positively correlates with the IL-6 expression (R2 = 0.96 and p < 0.00001). Moreover, the AnxA1 and IL-6 expression negatively correlated with the Luminal A subtype, and the AnxA1 expression was higher in the TN subtype (Table 1).3.2. TNBC Cell Lines Express High Levels of AnxA1 and IL-6The expression of AnxA1 and its receptors, FPR1 and FPR2, was assessed in a non-tumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-10A), in ER-positive BC cell line (MCF-7), in HER2-positive cell line (MDA-MB-453), and TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-459). As previously described, the AnxA1 protein is expressed in the cytoplasm, nuclei and supernatants of MCF-10A cells. Lower levels of AnxA1 were detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells and were undetectable in supernatants of these lineages. The TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 and BT-459 displayed an intense expression of AnxA1 in the cytoplasm, nuclei, and supernatants (Figure 2A,B). Either in the cytoplasm or nuclei, it was possible to visualize AnxA1 in its intact form (37 kDa) and in its cleaved form (33 kDa). In the supernatants of TNBC cells, AnxA1 was abundantly expressed in its cleaved form. Figure S2 shows a whole membrane staining to demonstrate the specificity of antibodies and proper cell fractionation. Regarding FPRs expression, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells did not express either FPR1 or FPR2; MCF-10A cells expressed both FPR1 and FPR2, whereas MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 and BT-459 cells expressed FPR1 only (Figure 2C).We next analyzed the expression of IL-6 and the activation of STAT3 in the BC cell lines used in this study. We found that MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT459 cells secrete high amounts of IL-6 in the extracellular milieu, while IL-6 expression levels in MCF10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-453 cells were undetectable (Figure 3A). The levels of activation of STAT3 (STAT3pY705) were similar among all cell lines (Figure 3B,C), except for BT-549, which expressed lower levels of STAT3pY705. In order to assess whether the IL-6 expression was responsible for the activation of the STAT3 pathway in TNBC cells, we inhibited or activated the IL-6 signaling in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, by using TCZ or a rIL-6, respectively. As a control, we used cells treated with the vehicle only and cells treated with the inhibitor of STAT3, STC. As expected, STC inhibited the activation of STAT3 as visualized by the decrease in STAT3pY705 levels. TCZ significantly impaired STAT3 phosphorylation, while in cells treated with rIL-6, an increase in STAT3 activation levels was observed (Figure 3D).Taken together, these results showed that there is a concordance in the expression of AnxA1 and IL-6 in the supernatant of all the BC cell lines studied. Moreover, higher levels of both molecules were observed in the cytoplasm, nuclei, and supernatant of TNBC cells. On the contrary, STAT3 activation levels are similar among cell lines, except for BT-549. We, therefore, showed that the IL-6 signaling pathway might be of the mechanisms that activate STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 TNBC cells.3.3. AnxA1 Autocrine Signaling Leads to a Decrease in IL-6 ExpressionAs we previously described, the N-terminal peptide of AnxA1 induces an autocrine signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells. In order to confirm the AnxA1 autocrine signaling in MDA-MB-157 cells, this lineage was treated with CsH and the effect on IL-6 expression, on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and on cytosolic calcium, and was compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 4A), as well as cytosolic calcium concentration, were inhibited by CsH in MDA-MB-157 cells at a similar extent to what was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, the inhibition of FPR1 by CsH increased IL-6 secretion in both cell lines (Figure 4C). We next compared, by Western blotting analysis, the effect of CsH on AnxA1 expression on the two TN cell lines. Again, the behavior was similar, since CsH slightly decreased the nuclear localization of AnxA1 while significantly increasing the secretion of AnxA1 in both cell lines (Figure 4D). As previously described, by knocking down AnxA1 in MDA-MB-231, it was possible to observe an increase in the secretion of IL-6. In accordance with the increased levels of IL-6 in the supernatant of cells treated with CsH, the levels of STAT3pY705 were also upregulated after treatment (Figure 4E).Based on these results, we further sought to test whether this increase in IL-6 could be, indeed, elicited in order to increase AnxA1 secretion and its signaling through FPR1. Then, we treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cell lines with rIL-6, with a neutralizing antibody anti-human IL-6 (TCZ), and with an inhibitor of the IL-6 signaling pathway, STAT3 (STC). An increase in AnxA1 secretion was observed upon treating cells with rIL-6 (Figure 5A), while the treatment with either TCZ or STC inhibited AnxA1 secretion in both cell lines (Figure 5B,C). Taken together, these results suggest that the IL-6 signaling pathway is important in TNBC cells to stimulate the secretion of AnxA1.The activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and cytosolic calcium levels were also recorded. By analyzing the ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels by flow cytometry, we observed an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon treating cells with rIL-6 and, in contrast, we found that the treatment with either TCZ or STC was highly effective in inhibiting ERK1/2 activation (Figure 6A). Likewise, treatment with rIL-6 stimulated cytosolic calcium levels and either TCZ or STC decreased cytosolic calcium concentrations (Figure 6B).These results demonstrated that IL-6 signaling is one of the mechanisms responsible for the activation of ERK1/2 and cytosolic calcium rise. We also observed that when the AnxA1 autocrine signaling is inhibited, there is an increase in the expression and autocrine signaling of IL-6. This raise in IL-6 represents a compensatory mechanism that TNBC cells activate in order to stimulate the AnxA1 autocrine signaling.3.4. IL-6 Inhibition Is Involved in Tumor GrowthRegarding the evidence that IL-6 signaling elicits the AnxA1/FPR1 axis leading in TNBC cells, we tested the in vivo effect of this receptor inhibition on tumor growth and fibroblast migration. The analysis of fibroblast migration under the influence of IL-6 present in supernatants of TNBC cells aims to find out the possible involvement of this cytokine in the establishment/remodeling of TME. Female nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors were treated with a control solution (PBS + DMSO 5%) or TCZ three times a week for one month while monitoring the primary tumor and metastasis. Figure 7A shows tumor growth over time. It was possible to observe that TCZ completely arrests tumor growth in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.001; Paired t-test). Figure 7B illustrates in vivo bioluminescence imaging of a tumor relapse and distal metastasis.MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells were treated with a rIL-6, CsH, TCZ, and with STC, and the supernatants were used to treat HFF cells (Figure 7C). Fibroblasts migrated more rapidly in the presence of the supernatant from TNBC cells treated with rIL-6. The treatments with CsH, STC, and TCZ decreased migration properties when compared to their control cells. Indeed, CsH, as a FPR antagonist, inhibits AnxA1 signaling. Therefore, the inhibition of FPR1 and IL-6 modulated the motility of fibroblasts, and it can be considered an important factor for the TME. Even though CsH increases IL-6 that in turn increases secreted AnxA1, AnxA1 cannot signal through FPR1. Finally, the supernatants derived from the MDA-MB-231 cell line stably knocked down for AnxA1 (Figure S3) were used to evaluate the motility of HFF (Figure 7D). Quantifications of gap closures are reported in Figure S4.4. DiscussionBC molecular classification is based primarily on the expression of ER, PR and HER2. This classification, in addition to improving diagnosis, drives targeted therapies such as hormonal therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen and Aromatase inhibitor) and HER2-targeted therapy (e.g., Trastuzumab). TNBC is the most aggressive BC subtype, displaying the worst prognosis and being responsible for a high incidence of metastases and low survival in patients with BC.AnxA1 is a 37-kDa calcium-dependent phospholipid-linked protein that acts in the anti-inflammatory process and immune response. It is a downstream mediator of the actions of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in cells. Many studies have shown that an increased expression of AnxA1 in TNBC and higher levels of AnxA1 have been observed in patients with familial BC, associated with the BRCA1/2 mutation, poorly differentiated lesions, and with younger patients. Furthermore, the AnxA1 expression was higher in lymph node metastases compared to primary tumors and correlates with BC aggressiveness. AnxA1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei and is secreted into the extracellular medium of TNBC cells, where it elicits an autocrine loop through its receptor, FPR1. Such autocrine signaling is essential in TNBC cell migration and invasion, thus, promoting metastases formation.IL-6 is involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and oncogenesis. In previous studies, higher IL-6 levels were found to be important for TNBC tumor growth and metastases, and serum IL-6 levels increased with pathological grades. IL-6 binds to its receptor complex (IL-6R), inducing the dimerization of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) to promote the signal transducer and activation of STAT3 through the phosphorylation of Tyrosine 705. STAT3 is highly expressed and constitutively activated in TNBC cells, regulating the expression of their downstream target genes, promoting proliferation and tumor aggressiveness. IL-6/STAT3 signaling has been associated with tumor progression in BC and lung cancer by inducing EMT and angiogenesis. Herein, we showed that the IL-6 expression was higher in TNBC samples and TNBC cell lines and higher levels of IL-6 correlated with higher levels of AnxA1. In our work, besides confirming the existence of an autocrine signaling of AnxA1 in TNBC, we demonstrated that IL-6 activates this pathway. Indeed, we observed that the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was responsible for inducing the secretion of AnxA1 and the subsequent activation of the AnxA1/FPR1 autocrine axis.According to previous studies, TNBC cells secrete autocrine IL-6 and are less responsive to paracrine IL-6 signaling, thus, these cells are less dependent on TME-derived IL-6. This exposure to IL-6 leads to the chronic induction of STAT3pY705, which promotes further growth and invasion of breast tumor cells. TME is composed of signaling molecules from extracellular matrix elements (ECM), endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and immune and inflammatory cells, which together play an important role in growth and invasion. Fibroblast cells in TME provide support for the migration, through the bloodstream, of cancer cells, contributing to metastasis. TNBC is enriched with CAFs, which, in turn, contribute to immunosuppression. In our study, we suggest that the interaction between the AnxA1 and IL-6 signaling pathways could be involved in the establishment of a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Indeed, when we treated HFF cells with the supernatants of AnxA1 or IL-6-inhibited TNBC cells, it resulted in a decreased migration. This result suggests that the IL-6 pathway could be involved in TME formation and the subsequent promotion of tumor progression due to its role in increasing the AnxA1 secretion. Secreted AnxA1, besides activating an autocrine loop in TNBC cells, could elicit signaling pathways in fibroblast, promoting the migration of this cell type. Probably due to this effect in promoting TME, we observed that TCZ suppressed TNBC growth in vivo. Our results are in line with Karakasheva et al., which demonstrated that TCZ suppresses tumor growth in vivo in part via the inhibition of STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling, and IL-6 mediates the crosstalk between tumor cells and activated fibroblasts in TME. In another study, IL-6 modulated the immune status of TME, increasing the antitumor effector function of CD8 + T cells and IL12 production by CD11c + dendritic cells, leading to increased metastatic colonization of colorectal cancer cells. In the cancer context, it is known that the IL-6 is responsible to promote tissue invasion, EMT, acute-phase proteins and Th17 cells. TCZ has a potent antiangiogenic effect and impedes TNBC cells to promote the differentiation of endothelial cells into network-like tubular structures in vitro, and impaired neovascularization in humanized breast orthotopic tumor xenografts. Therefore, TCZ could be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC. In this study, we demonstrated and suggest that the AnxA1 and IL-6 pathways seem to act together in TNBC cells, leading to higher aggressiveness. The mechanism currently evaluated must be considered together with others that may interfere with the behavior of breast tumor cells; according to our results in Figure 8:(a) IL-6 pathway sustains the AnxA1 autocrine signaling in TNBC. (1) IL-6 binds to its receptor (IL-6R) and stimulates STAT3 phosphorylation. (2) The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway stimulates the autocrine signaling of the AnxA1 N-terminal peptide (N-ter AnxA1) through FPR1. (3) Hence, AnxA1 induces a cytosolic calcium increase and ERK1/2 activation, thus, supporting BC aggressiveness. (4) Moreover, AnxA1 stimulates the motility of the surrounding fibroblasts, thus, contributing to the formation of a tumor-promoting TME.(b) The inhibition of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway decreases AnxA1 autocrine signaling and TNBC aggressiveness when IL-6 signaling is inhibited by TCZ. (1) A decreased STAT3 phosphorylation is observed. (2) The lack of IL-6 signaling downregulates AnxA1 autocrine signaling, thus, leading to decreased ERK1/2 activation levels, decreased cytosolic calcium and aggressiveness and the inhibition of motility of the surrounding fibroblasts.5. ConclusionsIn summary, the present work proposes a functional interaction between AnxA1/FPR1 and IL-6 signaling pathways in TNBC. We demonstrated that in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, the IL-6 signaling cascade modulates the activation of the AnxA1/FPR1 autocrine axis. We decided to use TCZ in our in vivo study as it is an FDA-approved drug, which reduced tumor growth and metastasis formation in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors. We also described that the IL-6/AnxA1/FPR1 pathways influence TME by reducing fibroblast cell motility. In this sense, new experiments knocking down FPR1 and rIL-6 in TNBC cells can further confirm the important role of these receptors in cell survival and aggressiveness. Finally, IL-6 inhibition can be used as a possible therapeutic intervention and/or a new adjuvant therapy to improve the clinical outcome of patients with TNBC.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: Immunohistochemistry staining negative control; Figure S2: Whole western blotting image staining; Figure S3: (A) Western blotting cropped images of AnxA1 expression in MDA-MB-231 expressing a shRNA control (shCRT) or a shRNA specific for AnxA1 (shAnxA1).

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed to assess differences in CD117+ cells within the total BM population.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and either formalin-fixed or snap-frozen. (a\u2013g) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and stained with (a\u2013c) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or (e\u2013g) subjected to immunohistochemistry with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification for the presence of metastatic tumor cells (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a,e) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (b,f) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (c,g) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. (d) Positive control; MCF7 primary human breast tumor tissue. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels (a\u2013c) and top panels (d\u2013g) and high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels (a\u2013c) and bottom panels (d\u2013g). (h) DNA was isolated from snap-frozen lung tissue from tumor-na\u00efve control mice, MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and SUM159 tumor-bearing mice (n = 15/group) and subjected to qPCR analysis using primers specific to the human ALU sequence.Expression of the premetastatic niche markers fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 is enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, lungs were harvested and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against murine fibronectin (FN) (a,e,i); tenascin-c (TNC) (b,f,j); periostin (POSTN) (c,g,k) or MMP9 (d,h,l) prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/lung/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a\u2013d) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (e\u2013h) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (i\u2013l) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels); high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels).Mice bearing triple negative SUM159 tumors demonstrate increased mRNA expression of the premetastatic markers fibronection, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX and CCL2 in the lungs. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and snap-frozen. RNA was isolated from lungs and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to assess the expression of murine fibronectin (a), tenascin-c (b), periostin (c), MMP9 (d), collegen A1 (e), LOX (f) and CCL2 (g) (n = 15 mice/group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. \u03b1 = significantly different from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls. \u03b2 = significantly different from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.005).The presence of a triple-negative SUM159 breast tumor modifies the soluble lung microenvironment to enhance breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and used for the generation of lung-conditioned media (LCM) as described previously. To assess migration, (a) SUM159 or (b) MCF7 cells were subjected to transwell migration assays for 18 h as described in the Materials & Methods. To assess proliferation, (c) SUM159 or (d) MCF7 cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation assays as described in the Materials & Methods.

Breast cancer-derived EVs were isolated from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines as described in the Materials and Methods and characterized as described in Supplemental Figure S4. Cell lines included non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D), three TN cell lines (MDA-MB-231 (231), SUM159 and LRCP17 (derived from a patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells.

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

To this end, we investigated the effect of the natural and pharmacologically safe molecule, caffeine, on CAF cells and their various procarcinogenic effects. We have shown here that caffeine up-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1, and reduces the expression/secretion of various cytokines (IL-6, TGF-\u03b2, SDF-1 and MMP-2), and down-regulates \u03b1-SMA.

Breast carcinogenesis is a complex process involving molecular and functional alterations in both the epithelial compartment and its microenvironment. Several lines of evidence indicate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which constitute a major portion of the reactive tumor stroma, actively participate in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Indeed, a large amount of data has emerged showing cancer-promoting function of these cells through paracrine effects that escort tumor cells through all the carcinogenesis steps. This involves many signaling proteins that transmit the message in both directions, allowing cooperative crosstalk between cancer cells and their stroma. It has been clearly shown that stromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) secretion. Several other chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) also participate in this stromal fibroblast-related activation of tumor growth and spread.Thereby, it became clear that an efficient cancer therapy should take into account the presence of stromal cells, which could be responsible for resistance to treatment and also the recurrence of tumor cells. To respond to such vital problem some bioactive dietary components could be of great therapeutic value. Indeed, several natural products are already in use as therapeutic drugs or are currently involved in late-phase clinical trials.Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), a natural purine alkaloid found in coffee, tea, and cacao, is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world. Caffeine has different pharmacological actions. Recently, many studies reported that caffeine has anti-cancer properties through the induction of apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation in several cancer types.Therefore, we questioned here whether caffeine has the potential to suppress the procarcinogenic effects of active breast cancer-associated fibroblasts. The present data provide clear evidence that caffeine can permanently inactivate breast stromal myofibroblasts, and consequently inhibits their paracrine procanrcinogenic effects.Materials and MethodsCells, Cell Culture and ChemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and cultured as previously described. Breast tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital. Signed informed consent was obtained from all the patients under the Research Ethical Committee Project number RAC#2031091. HUVEC and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotics and antimycotics solutions, which were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Caffeine (Sigma) was dissolved in water.Cellular Lysate Preparation and ImmunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. Antibodies directed against alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21, 2AR2, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), Stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), Akt and phospho-Akt (193H12), Erk1/2 and phospho-Erk1/2 (THR202/TYR204) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), p16INK4a and Caveolin-1 from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA); p21 (F-5), p53 (DO-1), PTEN (A2B1) and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, FL-335) were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).siRNA TransfectionCAF-180 cells were transfected with PTEN-siRNA and non-targeting siRNA (Thermo-Scientific) using RNAiFect transfection reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer.RNA Purification and qRT-PCRThis has been performed as previously described.

The OD was used at 450-nm on a standard ELISA plate-reader.Quantification of Protein and RNA Expression LevelsThe expression levels of the immunoblotted proteins were measured using the densitometer (BIO-RAD GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer) as previously described.Chemotaxis and Invasion AssayCell migration and invasion was evaluated using the 24-well BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber as per the manufacturer guideline (BD Bioscience). In brief, 0.75 mL of migration buffer (serum-free media) or chemo-attractants (serum-containing media) were added to the lower chambers. Cells were washed 3 times in migration media and 2\u20134\u00d7105 cells were added to the upper wells separated by an 8 micron pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with a Diff Quick stain (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane with Q-tips. After air drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification; 40x). Each assay was performed in triplicate. The results were expressed as mean SD of migrating cells per fields counted.HUVEC Endothelial Tube Formation AssayThe endothelial tube formation assay was performed using the Chemicon in vitro Angiogenesis Assay Kit. Wells in a 96 well plate were coated with ice cold EC Matrix Gel Solution in the EC Matrix Diluent Buffer. After solidification of the matrix at 37\u00b0C, HUVEC cells were seeded onto the polymerized EC Matrix at a concentration of 5\u00d7104 cells in 50 \u00b5L of RPMI media per well. Conditioned media, complete media (as positive control) or serum-free media (as negative control) were immediately added after plating HUVEC cells for a final 1\u22361 ratio of RPMI media to conditioned media. The number of tubule branches and cavities were photographed and counted after 18 hr of incubation.Assessment of SA- \u03b2 -gal ActivityEndogenous senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity was assessed histochemically. Cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and then permeabilized with 0.02% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate for 15 min, followed by incubation (overnight at 37\u00b0C) in a 1 mg/ml solution of X-Gal substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside) with 5 mM potassium ferricyanide and 2 mM magnesium chloride together with the above-mentioned detergents, at an acidic pH (6.0). The proportion of \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) positive cells was assessed in a total count of 500 cells.Conditioned MediaCells were cultured in media +/\u2212 serum, and then the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were either used immediately or frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test and p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsCaffeine Up-regulates the Tumor Suppressor Proteins p16, p21, p53 and Caveolin-1 in Active Breast Stromal FibroblastsIt has been previously shown that the tumor suppressor proteins p16INK4A (p16), p53, p21WAF1 (p21) and Cav-1 are down-regulated in CAFs and enhance the pro-carcinogenic paracrine effects of these cells. Therefore, the major aim of the present study was to explore the possible up-regulation of these genes in breast stromal myofibroblasts using caffeine. To this end, the primary breast cancer-associated fibroblasts CAF-114 and CAF-180 were treated with different doses of caffeine (0, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 mM) for 1 hr, and then were harvested and whole cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies. Figure 1A shows clear up-regulation of p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1 in response to all caffeine doses in both cell cultures. Figure 1B shows that the maximum fold of induction for most of these genes was reached in response to 0.2 mM in both CAF-114 and CAF-180. In response to higher doses (0.5 mM and 0.8 mM), p16 level further increased in both cell cultures but only slightly, while the levels of p53 and Cav-1 were slightly reduced (Figure 1B). For p21 level, no significant change occurred in CAF-180, while a strong decrease was observed in CAF-114 in response to 0.5 and 0.8 mM of caffeine (Figure 1B). This indicates that 1 hr of caffeine treatment at low dose (0.2 mM) up-regulates the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1 in breast CAF cells.Caffeine up-regulates the expression of p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1.Cells were either sham treated or challenged with the indicated caffeine concentrations for 1 \u00b5g of proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodies. (A) Immunoblots. (B) Histograms show the expression levels of the indicated proteins. The values were determined by densitometry and normalized against GAPDH. Error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D.Caffeine Represses Active Stromal FibroblastsIn order to test the possible caffeine-dependent inactivation of myofibroblasts, we investigated the effect of caffeine on the expression of various markers of active fibroblasts. Therefore, CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 h. Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against SDF-1, MMP-2, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA. Figure 2A and 2B shows that caffeine significantly suppressed the expression of all these proteins. To confirm this we used quantitative RT-PCR to assess the expression level of these genes at the mRNA level. Figure 2C shows that caffeine treatment (0.2 mM) significantly reduced the mRNA levels of MMP-2, SDF-1 and IL-6.Caffeine inhibits the expression/secretion of SDF1, IL-6, MMP-2 and TGF-.CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine for 1 hr. (A) Whole cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodies. (B) Histograms show the expression levels of the indicated proteins. The values were determined by densitometry and normalized against GAPDH. (C) Total RNA was prepared and used to assess the level of the indicated genes by qRT-PCR. The obtained values were normalized against \u03b2-actin. (D) Secreted levels of proteins were determined in SFCM by ELISA and shown in the histograms. Error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D. *: p<0.05.To further confirm this and show the effect on the secretion of these proteins, serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) was collected from both sham- and caffeine-treated cells (0.2 mM for 1 h), and the levels of secreted proteins were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of secreted proteins from CAF-180 were strongly reduced as compared to the levels of these proteins secreted from the control cells (Fig. 2D). Indeed, the levels of SDF-1, MMP-2, IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 were 70, 7.5, 2.6 and 8.75 fold reduced, respectively (Fig. 2D).Caffeine Inhibits the Migration/Invasion Potential of CAF Cells through PTEN-Dependent Erk1/2 and Akt InactivationIn order to confirm caffeine-dependent inhibition of active fibroblasts, we sought to investigate the effect of caffeine on the migration/invasion abilities of CAF cells. Therefore, CAF-180 cells were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) and were either sham-treated (control) or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr. Subsequently, cells were collected and seeded with SFM into BioCoat Boyden chambers either matrigel-coated (invasion) or uncoated (migration). Complete medium (CpM) was added to the lower chambers of the inserts as chemo-attractant, and cells were reincubated for 18 hr. Figure 3A shows that the migration and invasion of caffeine-treated cells were significantly reduced as compared to control cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.000178 and 0.000139, respectively).Caffeine suppresses the invasion/migration of active breast stromal fibroblasts through Akt/Erk1/2 inhibition.CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine for 1 hr. (A) Cells were cultured on the upper compartments of BioCoat matrigel chambers in the presence of serum-free media. After 18 hr of incubation, cells were stained with Diff-Quick stain, and then were counted. The histograms depict the average numbers of invasive and migrated cells. (B) Whole-cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodies. (C) Histograms show the expression levels of the indicated proteins. The values were determined by densitometry and normalized against GAPDH. Error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D. *: p<0.05. (D) CAF-180 cells were transfected with PTEN-siRNA or a scrambled sequence, and then cells were either sham-treated of challenged with caffeine for 1 hr. cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis utilizing antibodies against the indicated proteins.To explore the molecular mechanisms that underlay caffeine-dependent modulation of stromal fibroblast migration/invasion, we studied the effect of caffeine on the phosphorylation/activation of the pro-invasive protein kinases Erk1/2 and Akt. Therefore, CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM for 1 hr). Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against Akt/pAkt and Erk1/2/pErk1/2. Figure 3B and 3C shows that while the levels of Erk1/2 and Akt were not affected by caffeine treatment, the levels of the active/phosphorylated forms of these proteins were significantly down-regulated in caffeine-treated cells as compared to control cells.To elucidate how caffeine inhibits the phosphorylation of these 2 protein kinases, we tested the effect of caffeine on PTEN, which is a negative regulator of Akt and Erk1/2. Figure 3B and C shows that caffeine-treatment markedly increased PTEN protein level (18 fold) as compared to control cells (P\u200a=\u200a0.0048). These results indicate that caffeine inhibits the migration/invasion abilities of CAF cells through inhibition of Akt/Erk1/2 by PTEN up-regulation. To confirm this, caffeine-related activation of Akt and Erk1/2 was investigated in PTEN-deficient cells. To this end, PTEN was down-regulated using specific siRNA (a scrambled sequence was used as control) in CAF-180 cells, and then both PTEN-deficient and control cells were treated with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 24 hrs. As expected, PTEN was up-regulated in control cells but not in PTEN-siRNA expressing cells (Fig. 3D). However, while the level of active Akt and Erk1/2 decreased in caffeine-treated control cells, their levels remained constant in PTEN-deficient cells (Fig. 3D). This indicates that caffeine-dependent reduction in the level of active Atk and Erk1/2 is PTEN-related.Caffeine Suppresses CAF-related Enhancement of Invasion/Migration of Breast Cancer CellsAfter showing that caffeine inhibits the secretion of procarcinogenic factors from CAF cells, we sought to investigate whether this inhibition would affect the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr, and then caffeine was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and were subsequently reincubated in SFM for 24 hr to generate SFCM. MDA-MB-231 cells suspended in SFM were added to the upper compartments, while CpM, SFM, SFCM-caffeine and SFCM-control were added separately to the lower compartments of the Boyden chambers used for the migration and invasion assays. After 18 hr of incubation, cells were stained with Diff-Quick stain, and then were counted. Figure 4 shows that the invasion ability of breast cancer cells was 3 fold lower in the presence of SFCM from caffeine-treated cells (caffeine-SFCM) than from control cells (SFCM). Interestingly, the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of caffeine-SFCM was similar to that obtained in the presence of SFM (Figure 4). Similar inhibitory effect was obtained for the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells under the same conditions (Fig. 4). These results show that caffeine suppressed breast stromal fibroblast-dependent induction of the migratory and invasiveness abilities of breast cancer cells, confirming caffeine-dependent inactivation of breast stromal myofibroblasts.Caffeine inhibits MDA-MB-231 invasion/migration in a paracrine manner.Serum-free conditioned media were collected from CAF-180 cells either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM, for 1 hr), SFM as well as complete media (CpM) were also used as control. These media were added separately into the lower compartments of the 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MDA-MB-231 cells (1\u00d7104) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the migration (non-coated chambers) and invasion (Matrigel Invasion Chamber) plates and incubated for 18 hr. Average numbers of migrated/invaded cells were depicted in the histograms. Error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D. *: p<0.05.Caffeine Mediates Sustained EffectsAfter showing that caffeine effect was sustained following caffeine withdrawal and incubation of cells in caffeine-free medium for 24 hr (Fig. 4), we sought to test whether caffeine effect on the various cancer-related molecular pathways is also persistent. To this end, CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr, and then caffeine-containing medium was removed and cells were washed 3 times with PBS. Thereafter, cells were incubated in caffeine-free medium for 24 hr, and then were split and reincubated in caffeine-free medium for another 48 hr. Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies. Figure 5A shows that 1 hr of caffeine treatment increased the levels of the 4 tumor suppressor genes (p16, p21, p53 and caveolin-1). Importantly, this up-regulation was sustained for 24 hr before and 48 hr after splitting in caffeine-free medium. Figure 5B shows that even after 24 hr of caffeine withdrawal the tumor suppressor proteins p16 and p53 were still highly expressed as compared to their basal levels. Concomitantly, \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 protein levels remained also down-regulated (Fig. 5B). This indicates that caffeine treatment for 1 hr led to persistent inhibition of active breast stromal fibroblasts.Caffeine effects are persistent.(A) Cells were either sham-treated (0) or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM, for 1 hr), and then immediately harvested (1) or reincubated in caffeine-free medium for 24 hr, and then were either harvested (24) or split and reincubated for another 48 hr (split). Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared from all these cells and the levels of various proteins were assessed by immunoblotting. (B) Cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr, and then reincubated in caffeine-free medium for 24 hr. Cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblot analysis. The numbers below the bands represent fold of change as compared to the level at time 0, upon normalization against GAPDH used as internal control. (C) SA-\u03b2-gal activity was analyzed. Scale bars represent 50 \u00b5m. (D) Histogram shows SA-\u03b2-gal labeling index. Error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D.One explanation of this phenomenon is the possible caffeine-related induction of senescence (a permanent process) through the induction of p16, p21 and p53. To test this hypothesis, we measured the SA-\u03b2-gal activity in caffeine-treated cells (0.2 mM for 1 hr and reincubation for 24 hr in caffeine-free medium). Figure 5C and D shows that caffeine treatment that led to persistent effect, did not change the shape of cells and also did not increase the level of SA-\u03b2-gal activity, suggesting that caffeine does not induce senescence in these cells.Caffeine Suppresses the Expression/Secretion of VEGF-A in CAFs and Inhibits their Pro-angiogenic EffectSince CAFs play a major role in the formation of new blood vessels, we sought to investigate the possible role of caffeine in the suppression of the main angiogenesis factor VEGF-A in stromal fibroblasts and test their paracrine effect on endothelial cells. To this end, CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against VEGF-A. Figure 6A shows that caffeine significantly suppressed (3 fold) the expression of VEGF-A as compared to the basal level of the protein (p\u200a=\u200a0.00555).Caffeine inhibits VEGF-A expression/secretion in stromal fibroblasts and their pro-angiogenic effects in vitro.CAF-180 cells were either sham treated or challenged with caffeine for 1 hr. (A) Whole-cell lysates were prepared and 50 \u00b5g of proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodies (upper panel). The histograms show the expression levels of the indicated proteins (lower panels). (B) Total RNA was prepared and used to assess the level of VEGF-A by qRT-PCR. The obtained values were normalized against \u03b2-actin. (C) CAF-180 cells were treated with caffeine for 1 hr. Non-treated cells were cultured under the same conditions and were used as control. Secreted levels of proteins were determined by ELISA and shown in the histogram. (D) Cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr, and then caffeine was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and were subsequently reincubated in SFM for 24 hr to generate SFCM that have been used to treat HUVEC cells previously plated on matrigel (96-well plate), then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 hr. (E) Histogram shows the average number of formed cavities. Error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D. *: p<0.05.To investigate the effect of caffeine on the VEGF-A mRNA, total RNA was purified from the same cells and the VEGF-A mRNA was amplified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using specific primers. Figure 6B shows significant caffeine-dependent down-regulation of the VEGF-A mRNA as compared to the control (p\u200a=\u200a0.01041), indicating that caffeine affects VEGF-A expression at the mRNA level.Active Akt and Erk1/2 are also major regulators of angiogenesis through the activation of HIF-1\u03b1, which up-regulates VEGF-A. We have shown in Figure 3B that caffeine inhibits Erk1/2 and Akt activation. Therefore, we tested the effect of caffeine on the downstream effector HIF-1\u03b1. Interestingly, Figure 6A shows that like for Akt and Erk1/2, caffeine also down-regulated HIF-1-\u03b1 (3.5 fold). This suggests a potential role of caffeine in inhibiting VEGF-A through suppressing Akt and Erk1/2 and their downstream effector and VEGF-A transactivator HIF-1\u03b1.To further elucidate the inhibitory effect of caffeine on the expression of VEGF-A, SFCM-caffeine and SFCM were respectively collected from caffeine-treated CAF-180 cells and their control cells, and used to assess the secreted level of the VEGF-A protein utilizing the ELISA assay. Interestingly, caffeine markedly suppressed the secretion of VEGF-A from CAF-180 cells. The level of secreted VEGF-A was 21 fold lower from caffeine-treated cells relative to their control cells (Fig. 6C). These results show that caffeine inhibits VEGF-A expression/secretion of active breast stromal fibroblasts.Next, we investigated the effect of caffeine-treated cells on the differentiation of endothelial cells in vitro. Therefore, CAF-180 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with caffeine (0.2 mM) for 1 hr, and then caffeine was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS and were subsequently reincubated in SFM for 24 hr to generate SFCM that have been used to treated HUVEC cells (0.5\u00d7105) on Matrigel (96-well plate) for 18 hr at 37\u00b0C. Figure 6D and E shows that while the differentiation of HUVEC cells into primitive capillary-like structure occurred in the presence of SFCM, it was strongly inhibited in the presence of caffeine-SFCM. Similar results were obtained using CAF-114 cells (Fig. 6E). Together, these results indicate that caffeine suppresses VEGF-A expression/secretion in active stromal fibroblasts and consequently inhibits their pro-angiogenic paracrine effect.DiscussionCancer is a very complex entity composed of multiple cell types that cooperate to enable tumor growth and spread. Thereby, an efficient treatment should take into account the presence of non-carcinogenic but supportive cells, and hence makes the milieu unfertile for tumor growth. Consequently, agents that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the components of the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell-directed therapy. Therefore, we tested the effect of the nontoxic and pharmacologically safe caffeine in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active breast stromal fibroblasts. We have shown that caffeine at 200 \u00b5M up-regulates the expression of p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1, 4 important tumor suppressor genes with cell non-autonomous tumor suppressor functions. Indeed, these tumor suppressor genes were found to be down-regulated in many CAF cells and were shown to be responsible for the procarcinogenic paracrine effects of these cells. p16 and p53 negatively control the expression/secretion of the major CAF effector SDF-1. Therefore, caffeine suppressed the expression/secretion of SDF-1 and also MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b2from CAF cells. Furthermore, caffeine reduced the level of the major marker of myofibroblast cells \u03b1-SMA, and strongly inhibited the migratory/invasiveness abilities of CAFs. This effect was mediated through the inhibition of Erk1/2 and Atk. This inhibition was dependent on the up-regulation of their common inhibitor PTEN. Recently, Miwa et al. have shown that caffeine activates PTEN in sarcoma cells leading to the inactivation of Akt. However, caffeine affected the phosphorylation form of the protein with no effect on total PTEN, and 5 mM was required to reach 50% reduction in the level of phospho-PTEN. Similarly, it has been shown that caffeine suppresses NF-\u03baB and Erk1/2 activities in osteosarcoma cells. In another study, 10 mM of caffeine was used to inhibit the Akt pathway in various cancer cells. Together, these results indicate that caffeine can inhibit the Akt pathway. However, we present here the first indication that this inhibition can take place in non-carcinogenic breast stromal fibroblasts and using a concentration as low as 0.2 mM. In another study, Foukas et al. have shown caffeine-dependent inhibition of the kinase activities of PI3Ks in vitro . Furthermore, it has been also shown that caffeine can inhibit Akt and Erk in colon cancer cells. This confirms our data showing that caffeine is a strong inhibitor of the motility and the invasiveness of active breast stromal fibroblasts. In addition, we have shown that caffeine reduced the ability of these cells in enhancing the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, which is a direct consequence of reducing the expression/secretion of different procarcinogenic factors, including SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b2. Together, these results indicate that caffeine \u201cnormalizes\u201d active breast cancer-associated fibroblasts through up-regulating tumor suppressor proteins and inhibiting the 2 major pro-invasive/\u2212migratory protein kinases Erk1/2 and Akt.Since VEGF-A and its transactivator HIF-1\u03b1 are major pro-carcinogenic target of p16 and p53, we tested the effect of caffeine on the expression of HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF-A and the related pro-angiogenic effect of breast fibroblasts. We have shown that caffeine represses both VEGF-A and HIF-1\u03b1 in active breast stromal fibroblasts, and consequently repressed their pro-angiogenic paracrine effect (Figure 6). HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF-A are also under the control of Akt and Erk1/2, which play major role in angiogenesis, and were inactivated by caffeine treatment. This indicates that caffeine suppresses VEGF-A expression and the related angiogenesis through different pathways. Likewise, it has been previously shown that caffeine inhibits adenosine-induced accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF-A in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, chick chorioallantoic membrane assays were used to show that caffeine inhibits angiogenesis and the proliferation of HUVEC cells. In addition, Li et al have recently shown caffeine-dependent induction of endothelial cell death and the inhibition of angiogenesis. Notably, in these 3 studies and others the effect of caffeine was direct on endothelial cells, while in the present report the effect of caffeine was indirect through the inhibition of breast stromal fibroblasts pro-angiogenic paracrine effect. This shows that caffeine possesses anti-angiogenic effect through both autocrine and paracrine manners. This suggests that caffeine could be of great value for cancer prevention and/or treatment by preventing the pro-vascularization effect of stromal myofibroblasts.Importantly, we have also shown that all the effects of caffeine on CAF cells were sustained even after caffeine removal and cell splitting. This provides a proof of principle that cancer-associated breast stromal fibroblasts can be inactivated, and that caffeine can trigger this through modulating several cancer/inflammation-related pathways. The permanent nature of caffeine effect could result from epigenetic alterations. This effect could be mediated through modulating the expression of genes capable of affecting DNA methylation, such as DNMT, p16 and IL-6. Indeed, it has been previously shown a causal role of p16 disruption in modulating DNA hypermethylation, and the role of IL-6 in controlling methylation in breast cancer cells.While the role of caffeine in breast cancer prevention is still controversial, several reports have shown clear inverse association between caffeine-containing beverages and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Interestingly, it has been shown in a recent study on 93,676 Caucasian women that consumption of caffeinated coffee was associated with reduction in non-melanoma skin cancer. Furthermore, caffeine inhibited the development of benign mammary gland tumors in 7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA)\u2013treated female Sprague-Dawley rats. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress metastasis in a transgenic mouse model of mammary tumors. Moreover, in SKH-1 mice at high risk of developing malignant and nonmalignant tumors, oral administration of caffeine for 18\u201323 weeks inhibited the formation and decreased the size of both nonmalignant and malignant tumors. Therefore, caffeine or another non-toxic inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway could constitute an efficient approach to normalize active breast stromal fibroblasts and hence participates in efficient eradication of tumor cells through targeting their supportive milieu.A cup of coffee contains approximately 100 mg of caffeine, indicating that micromolar concentrations of caffeine can be reached in the human circulation by the daily coffee consumption. Indeed, it has been shown that oral absorption of caffeine (5 mg/Kg) was very rapid, reaching a peak plasma concentration (15.9\u201318.7 \u00b5g/mL) after approximately 30 min. Interestingly, the caffeine plasma half-lives varied from 2.7 to 9.9 h, indicating substantial inter-subject variability in caffeine elimination. This indicates the possibility of reaching physiologically active amount of caffeine in human circulation with the consumption of reasonable amount of caffeine.In summary, our study shows that caffeine can normalize active breast stromal fibroblasts, and therefore suppresses their procarcinogenic/metastatic potential. This effect is mediated through the induction of important tumor suppressor proteins (p16, p21, p53 and Cav-1), which suppresses the secretion of various procarcinogenic cytokines.ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisCancer associated fibroblasts in cancer pathogenesisCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts are a rate-limiting determinant for tumour progressionStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionPinto MP, Badtke MM, Dudevoir ML, Harrell JC, Jacobsen BM, ..

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

IntroductionBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of tumor and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. The functional interactions between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment have been involved in the metastatic evolution, which is a main determinant of breast cancer mortality. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms hidden behind breast cancer metastasis is urgently needed, to disclose new effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, a growing body of evidence has suggested a relationship between metabolic disorders, such as obesity, hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and both increased breast cancer risk and tumor-related mortality. Previous studies, nicely supporting these observations, have reported that the aforementioned chronic pathological conditions are characterized by the release of various factors, prompting an inflammatory landscape toward breast cancer development. For instance, an increase in the advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) has been observed under inflammatory conditions in patients affected by metabolic syndromes. AGEs are heterogeneous and harmful compounds derived from an irreversible nonenzymatic reaction between the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar and a free amino group of proteins, lipids or nucleic acids. AGEs can be generated endogenously or provided by exogenous sources in physiological and pathological conditions. The biological effects of AGEs are mainly mediated by the binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed in both normal and cancer cells. For instance, in different types of tumors including breast cancer, RAGE activation may lead to proliferative, angiogenic, migratory and invasive responses associated with malignant features and a worse prognosis. By orchestrating a feed-forward autocrine and/or paracrine loop that entails both the breast cancer cells and the surrounding stroma, RAGE acts as an important mediator, linking chronic inflammation to cancer progression.Pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8, play an important role in stimulating pro-metastatic effects in diverse types of tumors, including breast cancer. IL-8 is a small soluble protein that belongs to the CXC chemokine family. Initially, IL-8 was recognized as a modulator of neutrophil activity and a chemotactic agent released by monocytes and macrophages upon diverse stimuli. Nowadays, IL-8 is primarily acknowledged as a potent mediator of tumor progression, due to its ability to induce angiogenesis, survival, invasion and metastasis in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. As it concerns breast cancer, high IL-8 expression was assessed in breast tumors in relation to normal breast tissues along with its ability to stimulate the malignant progression. Nicely fitting with these data, the inhibition of IL-8 blunted the invasiveness of breast cancer cells either in vitro or in vivo model systems.Compelling evidence has demonstrated that the main components of the tumor stroma, named cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), play an active role in breast cancer through the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and other mediators within the tumor microenvironment. This dynamic network may prompt the failure of therapeutics, metastatic features and poor clinical outcomes. Of note, recent studies have also revealed that CAFs may facilitate the establishment of a supportive microenvironmental niche for the recruitment and growth of disseminated tumor-initiating cells.On the basis of these observations, we aimed to provide novel insights into the action of the AGEs/RAGE axis within the tumor microenvironment toward the acquisition of invasive and aggressive features of breast cancer cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bioinformatics Analyses The gene expression levels and clinical information were retrieved from 17 integrated Affymetrix gene expression datasets, as previously described. In brief, the Raw.cel files from 17 Affymetrix U133A/plus two gene expression datasets of primary breast tumors were retrieved from NCBI GEO (GSE12276, GSE21653, GSE3744, GSE5460, GSE2109, GSE1561, GSE17907, GSE2990, GSE7390, GSE11121, GSE16716, GSE2034, GSE1456, GSE6532, GSE3494), summarized with Ensembl alternative CDF, and then normalized with RMA, before their integration using ComBat to eliminate dataset-specific bias. A comprehensive survival analysis was performed, using the Affymetrix gene expression data of CXCR1 and CXCR2 along with the relapse-free survival (RFS) information of basal breast-cancer patients, which were filtered for missing values. The survivALL package was employed to examine the Cox proportional hazards for all of the possible points-of-separation (low\u2013high cut-points), selecting the cut-point with the lowest p-value and separating the patients into high (n = 254) and low (n = 38) CXCR1/2 expression levels. The Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve was generated using the survival and the survminer packages. All of the bioinformatics analyses were carried out using R Studio (Integrated Development Environment for R. RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA, USA). The box plots were performed with the tidyverse package and the related statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.2.2. ReagentsWe purchased AGEs-BSA (AGEs) from Abcam (DBA, Milan, Italy); the FPS-ZM1, BSA and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) from Merck Life Science (Milan, Italy). The Trametinib, Alpelisib and Reparixin were obtained from MedChemExpress (DBA, Milan, Italy). The anti-IL-8 neutralizing antibody (MAB208) was acquired from R&D Systems (Bio-Techne, Milan, Italy). All of the compounds were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), except for AGEs-BSA and BSA that were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and NAC that was solubilized in water. 2.3. Cell CulturesThe cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated, cultured and characterized as previously described from 10 invasive ductal breast carcinomas and pooled for the subsequent studies. Briefly, the specimens were cut into small pieces (1\u20132 mm diameter), placed in a digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90\u00d7 g for 2 min. The supernatant containing fibroblasts was centrifuged at 485\u00d7 g for 8 min, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts\u2019 growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham\u2019s F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy) and cultured at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The CAFs were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as the cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total of 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. The primary cell cultures of the breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. In particular, the cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9, sc-6260) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001 sc-53,253), obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA, Milan, Italy) (data not shown). To characterize the fibroblasts\u2019 activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) (data not shown). The MDA-MB-231 cells obtained from the ATCC cells (Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) with phenol red, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). The cells were used less than 6 months after resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma. All of the cell lines were grown in a 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. 2.4. Gene Expression StudiesThe total RNA was extracted and cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription, as previously reported. The expression of the selected genes was analyzed by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). The following primers were used: 5\u2032-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA-3\u2032 (ACTB Fwd.) and 5\u2032-CACCTCCCCTGTGTGGACTT-3\u2032 (ACTB Rev); 5\u2032-TGTGGGTCTGTTGTAGGGTT-3\u2032 (IL-8 Fwd.), 5\u2032-TCGGATATTCTCTTGGCCCT-3\u2032 (IL-8 Rev); 5\u2032-CGAGCCCTTTGATGACTTCCT-3\u2032 (c-Fos Fwd.) and 5\u2032-GGAGCGGGCTGTCTCAGA-3\u2032 (c-Fos Rev); 5\u2032-ACAGTGGCCACCTACAAAGG-3\u2032 (N-cadherin Fwd.) and 5\u2032-CCGAGATGGGGTTGATAATG-3\u2032(N-cadherin Rev); 5\u2032-TCCGCACATTCGAGCAAAGA-3\u2032(vimentin Fwd.) and 5\u2032-ATTCAAGTCTCAGCGGGCTC-3\u2032(vimentin Rev); 5\u2032-CAGTGGGAGAACCTCGAGAAG-3\u2032 (fibronectin Fwd.) and 5\u2032-TCCCTCGGAACATCAGAAAC-3\u2032 (fibronectin Rev). The primers were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer Express 2.0 software. The assays were performed in triplicate and the results were normalized with control mRNA levels of beta-actin (ACTB) and relative mRNA levels were calculated, using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method (\u0394\u0394Ct).The PCR arrays were carried out using a TaqMan\u2122 Human Chemokines Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplification reaction and the subsequent analysis were performed, using the platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). The heatmaps were drawn on the log2 fold changes of gene expression using the pheatmap package.2.5. Luciferase Assays and Gene Silencing ExperimentsThe IL-8 promoter luciferase construct was a kind gift from Prof. Richard O.C. Oreffo, Institute of Development Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton (UK). The expression vector for the Renilla luciferase pRL-TK (Promega, Milan, Italy) was used as an internal transfection control. The transfections were performed using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy), with a mixture containing 0.5 \u00b5g of IL-8 reporter plasmid and 5 ng of pRL-TK. After 8 h, the cells were treated for 18 h, as indicated. Then, the luciferase activity was normalized to the internal transfection control provided by the Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light-unit values obtained from the cells treated with the vehicle were set as one-fold induction upon which the activity induced by the treatments was calculated. For knocking down the RAGE expression, the cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), using a pool of three unique 27mer siRNA duplexes for RAGE (AGER, #SR319295) targeting-sequences (siRAGE) (10 nM) or a non-targeting scramble control (10 nM) for 24 h prior to the treatments (OriGene Technologies, DBA, Milan, Italy). The plasmid DN/c-Fos, which contains the sequence for a mutant form of the c-Fos protein that heterodimerizes with the c-Fos dimerization partners but does not allow DNA binding, was generously gifted to us by Dr C. Vinson (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.6. Western Blot AnalysisWestern blotting analyses were carried out, as previously described. The primary antibodies used are as follow: IL-8 (27095-1-AP) (Proteintech, DBA, Milan, Italy); p-AKT-(Ser473) (D9E) and RAGE (42544S) (Cell Signalling Technology, Euroclone, Milan, Italy); \u03b2-actin (AC-15), p-ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), AKT/1/2/3 (H-136) and c-Fos (E-8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). The proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) and revealed, using the chemiluminescent substrate Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).2.7. DCFDA Fluorescence Measurement of ROSThe intracellular ROS production was evaluated, using the non-fluorescent 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) probe, which becomes highly fluorescent when reacting with ROS. Briefly, the cells were treated as indicated, and then washed with PBS and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with 10 \u03bcM DCFDA (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Next, the cells were washed with PBS, and the fluorescent intensity of DCF was measured with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm, using the software Gen5 in Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).2.8. Immunofluorescence MicroscopyFifty percent of the confluent-cultured cells grown on coverslips were serum deprived for 24 h and then treated for 6 h, as indicated. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Then, after a brief rinsing with PBS, the slides were incubated for 90 min with Phalloidin-Fluorescent 488 Conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). Next, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and probed with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). The images were acquired using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the software Gen5 (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).2.9. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayThe ChIP experiments were carried out, normalized and analyzed as described. The primers used to amplify a region containing an AP-1 site located in the IL-8 promoter sequence were as follow: 5\u2032-GTTCTAACACCTGCCACTCT-3\u2032 (Fwd) and 5\u2032-CCACGATTTGCAACTGATGG-3\u2032 (Rev).2.10. Conditioned Medium The CAFs were seeded in regular medium in six-well multi-dishes and the next day were switched to a medium without serum. After 24 h, the CAFs were treated for 6 h with AGEs, as indicated; thereafter, the cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured for an additional 12 h with fresh serum-free medium. The supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min to remove cellular debris and used as the conditioned medium for the appropriate experiments.2.11. Acetone Precipitation of ProteinsThe protein precipitation from the conditioned medium derived from the CAFs was performed by using the precipitation method with acetone, as previously reported. Briefly, four volumes of ice-cold acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) were added to one volume of sample, the mixture was then vortexed and incubated at -20 \u00b0C overnight. This was followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Thereafter, the supernatants were discarded, the pellet was air dried, dissolved in Laemmli buffer 2\u00d7 and used in the appropriate experiments. In the Western blot analysis, the protein loading of the conditioned medium samples was checked by Ponceau red staining (0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid) of the blotted membranes.2.12. Polarization AssayThe MDA-MB-231 cells were serum deprived for 24 h and then exposed for 6 h to the conditioned medium collected from the CAFs treated as indicated. Then, the cells were processed as previously described.2.13. Transwell Migration and Invasion AssaysTranswell Migration and Invasion Assays were carried out, as previously described. Briefly, the transwell 8 \u00b5m polycarbonate membrane (Costar, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was used to evaluate in vitro migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. A total of 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 300 \u00b5L serum-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber, coated with (invasion assay) or without (migration assay) Corning\u00ae Matrigel\u00ae Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix (Biogenerica, Catania, Italy), diluted with serum-free medium at a ratio of 1:3. Next, the conditioned medium from the CAFs, treated as indicated, was added to the bottom chambers in the presence or absence of 300 ng/mL Ab-IL-8 or the CXCR1/2 inhibitor reparixin, where required. On reaching 6 h after seeding, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by wiping with a Q-tip, and the invaded or migrated cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). The images were acquired using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and the cells were counted using the WCIF ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.14. Statistical AnalysisThe data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons where applicable, using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The Kaplan\u2013Meier p-value is based on a log-rank test. (*) p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Results3.1. AGEs Induce ERK and AKT Phosphorylation in Breast CAFsPrevious studies have shown that the ERK1/2 and AKT transduction pathways act as critical mediators involved in the AGEs-dependent responses in both normal and cancer cells. In order to provide novel insights into the AGEs-mediated signaling within the tumor microenvironment, we sought to address whether AGEs may also activate ERK1/2 and AKT in the CAFs obtained from breast tumor patients. Both ERK and AKT phosphorylations were observed in a time-dependent manner upon AGEs exposure in the CAFs (Figure 1a), whereas the incubation with BSA alone had no effect (Supplementary Figure S1a, Supplementary Materials). Next, we verified whether RAGE is involved in these stimulatory effects elicited by the AGEs in the CAFs. By pharmacological and gene silencing approaches, we found that the activation of the ERK and AKT induced by AGEs is prevented in the presence of the RAGE inhibitor, FPS-ZM1 (Figure 1b), as well as transfecting the CAFs with siRNA sequences targeting RAGE (Figure 1c; Supplementary Figure S1b, Supplementary Materials). Reminiscing from previous data on the ability of AGEs to induce ROS levels in diverse cell contexts, we found that the AGEs treatment triggers the generation of ROS, however, this response was no longer observed either using the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (Figure 1d) or the ROS scavenger NAC (Figure 1e). Thereafter, we established that the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT upon AGEs exposure is strictly dependent on ROS generation, as ascertained by the ROS scavenger, NAC (Figure 1f).3.2. The Activation of AGEs/RAGE Transduction Pathway Up-Regulates IL-8 Levels in CAFsA growing body of evidence pointed out that RAGE is an important mediator connecting chronic inflammation to neoplastic progression through the various autocrine and/or paracrine interactions, which occur between the cancer cells and the components of the surrounding microenvironment. Hence, in order to investigate the pro-inflammatory gene expression profile elicited by the AGEs/RAGE activation within the breast tumor stroma, we performed TaqMan\u2122 gene expression experiments by Human Chemokine Array. To this end, the CAFs were treated with AGEs in the presence or absence of the RAGE inhibitor, FPS-ZM1 (Figure 2a). Thereafter, we focused our attention on the genes displaying a CT < 32 along with at least 0.58 log2 fold change upon the AGEs exposure, in relation to the vehicle-treated CAFs. IL-8 (also known as CXCL8) was the most upregulated gene, whose expression was abrogated using the RAGE inhibitor, FPS-ZM1. The induction of IL-8 by AGEs and the repressive effects elicited by the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 were confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels, respectively, by real-time PCR and Western blotting assays (Figure 2b,c). Similar results were then obtained by silencing the RAGE expression (Figure 2d; Figure S1c, Supplementary Materials). Furthermore, the AGEs-mediated increase in IL-8 was abolished at both the mRNA and protein levels, using the ROS scavenger, NAC (Figure 2e,f). Considering that the activation of the AGEs/RAGE signaling triggers the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, we assessed whether the IL-8 upregulation is no longer evident, using the MEK inhibitor trametinib as well as the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (Figure 2g). Next, the secretion of IL-8 upon AGEs exposure was evaluated in the conditioned medium collected from CAFs. Of note, the upregulation of the IL-8 levels prompted by AGEs in the conditioned medium derived from CAFs was prevented by the RAGE inhibitor, FPS-ZM1, and by knocking down the expression of RAGE (Figure 2h,i). In addition, we ascertained that the ROS scavenger NAC abrogates the secretion of IL-8 elicited by AGEs in the CAFs medium (Figure 2j).3.3. c-Fos Is Involved in the Up-Regulation of IL-8 Prompted by AGEs/RAGE Signaling in CAFsBased on the above data, we aimed to provide mechanistic insights into the upregulation of IL-8 promoted by the AGEs/RAGE axis in CAFs. Of note, we found that the transcriptional activation of the IL-8 promoter construct elicited by AGEs was no longer evident using the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1, the ROS scavenger NAC, the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (Figure 3a). Considering that the previous investigations have highlighted the main role played by c-Fos in the regulation of the IL-8 expression upon exposure to diverse treatments, we ascertained that the transactivation of the c-Fos promoter-construct upon AGEs treatment is abolished in the presence of the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1, the ROS scavenger NAC, the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (Figure 3b). Thereafter, performing real-time PCR and Western blotting assays, we established that the AGEs trigger c-Fos expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, however these responses were no longer evident in the presence of the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1, silencing RAGE expression and using the ROS scavenger NAC (Figure 3c\u2013g; Figure S1d, Supplementary Materials). Furthermore, the AGEs-mediated increase in the c-Fos expression was abrogated using the MEK inhibitor trametinib as well as the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (Figure 3h). Intriguingly, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays performed in the CAFs treated with AGEs revealed that c-Fos is recruited to the AP-1 site located within the human IL-8 promoter sequence (Figure 3i,j). Further supporting these results, the treatment with AGEs did not induce the transactivation of IL-8 promoter construct in CAFs previously transfected with a dominant negative form of c-Fos (DN/c-Fos) (Figure 3k). In accordance with these findings, the upregulation and secretion of IL-8 elicited by AGEs were prevented from transfecting the CAFs with the DN/c-Fos expression vector (Figure 3l,m).3.4. IL-8/CXCR1/2 Paracrine Activation Promotes the Acquisition of a Migratory and Invasive Phenotype of MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer CellsPrevious studies have revealed that the production and secretion of soluble factors by CAFs activate inflammatory responses, leading to the acquisition of aggressive and pro-metastatic cancer phenotypes. In this regard, chemokines and cytokines have been shown to play a critical role in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. For instance, IL-8 binding to the cognate receptors, namely CXCR1 and CXCR2, may promote a dysfunctional inflammatory microenvironment that contributes to tumor progression. On the basis of these observations, we performed an in silico evaluation by querying the Affymetrix dataset, which supplies the clinical information and mRNA expression data of a large cohort of breast tumor patients. Of note, a higher expression of the mRNA levels of CXCR1/2 was found in basal breast cancer subtype in relation to the luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2 and normal-like molecular subgroups (Figure 4a). In addition, the survival analysis performed on the basal breast cancer subtype revealed that a worse relapse free survival (RFS) characterizes patients exhibiting a high expression of CXCR1/2 (Figure 4b; Figure S2, Supplementary Materials). Next, we aimed to evaluate whether IL-8 secreted by CAFs may promote a feed-forward loop that engages CXCR1/2 toward the acquisition of certain malignant features in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which express elevated CXCR1/2 levels. Worthy, conditioned-medium collected from the AGEs-stimulated CAFs triggered a spindle-like morphology in the MDA-MB-231 cells, which was prevented using the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (Figure 4c). The abovementioned effects were also obtained by the neutralizing antibody anti-IL-8 (Figure 4b), as well as the CXCR1/2 inhibitor reparixin (Figure 4c).Accordingly, the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 prevented the formation of stress fibers in the MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to the conditioned medium from the AGEs-stimulated CAFs, as assessed through immunofluorescent staining of the polymerized actin (F-actin) (Figure 5a). Similar results were obtained in the presence of the neutralizing IL-8 antibody (Figure 5b), as well as the CXCR1/2 inhibitor reparixin (Figure 5c). To further appreciate the biological significance of the paracrine action of IL-8 in breast malignancy, we demonstrated that the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (Figure 6a,b), the neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody (Figure 6c,d) and the CXCR1/2 inhibitor reparixin (Figure 6e,f) abrogate the migration and invasion of the MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in the conditioned medium from the AGEs-treated CAFs. Next, the mRNA expression of certain Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) biomarkers, namely N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin, increased in the MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to the conditioned medium collected from AGEs-stimulated CAFs. However, these responses were no longer evident in the presence of the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (Figure S3, Supplementary Materials).4. DiscussionIn the current study, we investigated the role of the AGEs/RAGE transduction pathway in the multifaceted interaction that occurs between breast cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. In this vein, we first assessed that the activation of the AGEs/RAGE axis induces rapid ERK and AKT phosphorylation via ROS generation in CAFs obtained from breast cancer patients. Performing a PCR human chemokine array we then found that IL-8 is the most upregulated gene in AGEs-stimulated CAFs. Mechanistically, we ascertained that the AGEs/RAGE signaling cascade triggers IL-8 expression through the induction of c-Fos, which was recruited within the IL-8 promoter sequence. Thereafter, we assessed that IL-8, secreted in the conditioned medium collected from the AGEs-stimulated CAFs, acts in a paracrine manner through the cognate receptors CXCR1/2, empowering the acquisition of a spindle-like morphology and the actin polymerization in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Consequently, these cells acquire migratory and invasive properties, in accordance with previous studies highlighting the role of IL-8 in stimulating pro-metastatic effects in diverse types of tumors, including breast cancer.An intricate signaling network coordinates the regulation and secretion of IL-8 in both normal and tumor cells. Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, growth factors and hormones, were reported to upregulate the IL-8 expression. The key components of the tumor stroma, such as CAFs, have been also shown to promote the resistance to therapeutics and the acquisition of pro-metastatic phenotypes ensuing the production and release of IL-8 within the tumor milieu. In accordance with these findings, in the present study the AGEs, through the cognate receptor RAGE and the subsequent activation of the ROS-ERK1/2-AKT-c-Fos transduction pathway, triggered the expression of IL-8 and its release by the CAFs toward the acquisition of malignant features in the breast cancer cells.Impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance may increase the risk of breast cancer. For instance, diabetes in premenopausal women has been correlated with a major risk of developing a breast tumor, mostly the aggressive subtype named triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In addition, previous studies have indicated that breast cancer mortality associated with distant metastasis is elevated in those patients with co-occurring low-grade chronic inflammatory conditions, such as obesity and T2DM. Of note, the IL-8 serum levels were found markedly increased in the T2DM patients in relation to the healthy subjects, and positively correlated with worse metabolic control and an inflammatory state. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that IL-8 levels were found elevated in serum of cancer patients and correlated with a high tumor grade and an unfavorable clinical outcome. Furthermore, elevated levels of IL-8 were involved in the resistance to treatments in diverse types of cancers like pancreatic, colorectal and breast tumors. Likewise, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of IL-8 were shown to sensitize breast cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of conventional chemotherapy agents. The biological effects of IL-8 are mediated via two rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): CXCR1 and CXCR2, also known, respectively, as IL-8RA and IL-8RB. Similar to other GPCRs, CXCR1 and CXCR2 are composed of seven transmembrane domains, with extracellular N-terminus and intracellular C-terminus portions. The IL-8/CXCR1/2 axis has been involved in the stimulation of diverse signaling pathways, including PI3K, MAPK, JAK/STAT and RhoGTPase, which in turn mediate biological responses, such as proliferation, survival, invasion, cytoskeletal dynamics and angiogenesis. Moreover, the IL-8/CXCR1/2 system correlates with poor clinical prognosis in diverse types of tumor, including breast cancer. Moreover, a significant upregulation of the CXCR1/2 levels were detected in the invasive breast carcinoma samples in relation to normal breast tissues. Nicely fitting with these data, the blockade of IL-8 by a neutralizing antibody or the inhibition of CXCR1/2, blunted tumor growth and metastasis, and also reversed the resistance to treatments in breast cancer. In accordance with the aforementioned findings, our in silico analysis of the Affymetrix dataset displayed higher expression levels of CXCR1/2 in the basal subtype in relation to the other molecular subgroups of breast tumors. Likewise, the evaluation of the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves revealed a worse clinical outcome in basal breast cancer patients showing high CXCR1/2 levels. Providing further insights on the role of the IL-8/CXCR1/2 axis within the tumor microenvironment, we also assessed that the paracrine actions elicited by the conditioned medium collected from the AGEs-stimulated CAFs are no longer evidently inhibiting this axis.5. ConclusionsOur findings assessed for the first time the role of the AGEs/RAGE signaling pathway in breast CAFs and its involvement in the paracrine stimulation of the IL-8/CXCR1/2 axis toward the acquisition of malignant features of breast cancer cells. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the transduction cascade triggered by the IL-8/CXCR1/2 paracrine activation in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Likewise, in vivo studies are warranted in order to corroborate the present results and the usefulness of IL-8 as a therapeutic target in comprehensive approaches halting breast cancer progression.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

Beside traditionally considered as an insulating and mechanically supportive site of energy storage, adipose tissue has endocrine functions, capable of regulating systemic energy and metabolic homeostasis through a complex network of signals. The concept that adipose tissue, and more specifically adipocytes, are involved in tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis, is now called \u201cadiponcosis\u201d.Adipocytes surround breast cancer cells and may contribute to the stromal\u2013ductal epithelial cell\u2013cell interactions within the mammary microenvironment. In this regard, obesity has been shown to increase rates of breast cancer in postmenopausal women by 30\u201350%. Studies of mortality and survival illustrate that adiposity is associated with both poorer survival and increased likelihood of recurrence among breast cancer cases, regardless of menopausal status and after adjustment for stage and treatment. Death rate in very obese women (BMI \u2265 40.0) with breast cancer is three times higher than in very lean (BMI < 20.5) women.Moreover, epidemiological studies have also revealed that women with diabetes have a statistically significant 20% increased risk of breast cancer. Additionally, patients with breast cancer and preexisting diabetes have increased risk for distant metastasis and for all-cause mortality compared with their non-diabetic counterparts.Metabolic derangements, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, drive to adipocyte alterations with imbalanced production of adipokines, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, hormones, proangiogenic factors and extracellular matrix constituents. Virtually, all of the adipocyte factors may be envisioned as contributing factors for cancer onset and/or progression. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that adipocytes could promote breast tumor growth. Moreover, glucose and fatty acids modify adipocyte-releasing properties and enhance their ability to induce breast cancer cell proliferation. Nevertheless, how metabolic alterations at the level of the adipose tissue may affect tumor progression is still unclear.Here, we show that adipocytes may integrate inputs from metabolic environment and promote motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. This effect is induced, at least in part, by the CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), also known as RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), whose abundance in peritumoral adipose tissue correlates with metastasis and with poorer overall survival in women with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).RESULTSAdipocytes promote TNBC cell motilityIn order to investigate adipocyte effect on cancer cell invasiveness, MDA-MB231 triple negative breast cancer cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell, while differentiated human adipocytes were seeded in the lower chamber. Co-culture with adipocytes, in the absence of serum, increased MDA-MB231 invasive capacity through the matrigel filter by 1.7-fold compared to the same cells cultured in the absence of adipocytes (Figure 1A). At variance, co-culture with human Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells enhanced by only 1.2-fold MDA-MB231 invasion. The effect of adipocyte factors was similar to the positive control (i.e. cells incubated with 10% FBS medium).Effect of adipocytes and glucose-treated adipocytes on breast cancer cell motility(A) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with or without human SVF/adipocytes in the lower chamber in serum free-medium. Cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining as described in Materials and Methods. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells without SVF/adipocytes in the lower chamber, incubated in serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values (**p < 0.01). (B) Human adipocytes were shifted with high glucose medium (25 mM glucose-HG) or with low glucose medium (5.5 mM glucose-LG) for 24 h. Then, they were incubated with MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells incubated in serum-free HG or LG medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (**p < 0.01). #denote statistically significant values of HG over LG (#p < 0.05). (C) Human adipocytes were pre-incubated with HG medium or with LG medium for 24 h. Then, they were further incubated with regular glucose (15 mM) serum-free medium for 8 h. Media were collected (CM) and applied in the lower chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells incubated in regular glucose serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (*p < 0.05). #denote statistically significant values of CM-HG over CM-LG (#p < 0.05). (D) Confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded by manually scratching as described in Materials and Methods and incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes pre-incubated with either LG or HG medium for 24 h and further incubated with regular glucose serum-free medium for 8 h. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by a digital camera coupled to the microscope and percentage of wound distance was calculated with the camera software. The results have been reported as percentage of gap closure at 24 h compared with time 0. A complete gap closure was considered as 100%. *denote statistically significant values over MDA-MB231 cells incubated in regular glucose serum-free medium (*p < 0.05). #denote statistically significant values of CM-HG over CM-LG (#p < 0.05). The pictures are representative of wound gaps at 0 point and upon 24 h of scratch assay. For all the panels in the figure, data in the graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent triplicate experiments.Next, we tested whether glucose may change the promoting action of human adipocytes on MDA-MB231 invasiveness. To this end, human differentiated adipocytes, regularly cultured in 15 mM glucose, were shifted for 24 h in either 25 mM glucose (HG), a concentration resembling hyperglycemia in humans, or in 5.5 mM glucose (LG), a concentration representative of normal fasting glucose levels in humans. Then, adipocytes were co-cultured with MDA-MB231 in serum-free HG or LG medium for additional 24 h. As shown in Figure 1B adipocytes significantly increased cancer cell invasiveness and this effect is potentiated in HG (3-fold increase compared to LG). Similar results were obtained also with conditioned media (CM) system. In detail, adipocytes were cultured for 24 h either in HG and in LG. Media were changed and cells were allowed to secrete factors into freshly added serum free medium (15 mM glucose). After 8 h, CM were collected and applied into the lower chamber of a transwell system in presence of MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber on a matrigel-coated filter. As shown, pre-incubation of adipocytes with HG medium enhanced by about 2-fold their ability to induce MDA-MB231 cell invasiveness, compared to control cells (without CM) (Figure 1C). At variance, pre-incubation with LG medium significantly lowered their ability to promote invasiveness of breast cancer cells (Figure 1C).In order to test cell motility, confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded longitudinally and incubated with conditioned media derived from adipocytes incubated with HG (HG-CM) or LG (LG-CM) in presence of mitomycin C, an irreversible inhibitor of mitosis. Images were taken at 0 and 24 h after wounding. HG-CM increased motility of breast cancer cells by about 2-fold (Figure 1D). The wound closure was similar to that achieved with 10% FBS medium and significantly higher compared to that observed with LG-CM. Similar results were also obtained with ER-\u03b1 positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 1).Adipocyte-released CCL5 promotes motility and invasion of breast cancer cellsWe have previously shown that glucose increases the release of CCL5 and IGF-1 by adipocytes. Now, we provide evidences that glucose did not directly interfere with their secretion by cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2A\u20132B). In order to address the biological relevance of CCL5 and IGF-1 as adipocyte-derived motility promoting factors, MDA-MB231 were co-cultured with human adipocytes in presence of specific inhibitors of CCL5 action: a monoclonal antibody raised against CCL5 (CCL5-Ab) or a peptide for the CCL5 receptor CCR5 (CCR5-pep). Both CCL5-Ab and CCR5-pep almost completely prevented STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 3) as well as the effect of adipocytes on MDA-MB231 invasiveness (Figure 2A). At variance, AG1024, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1 receptor, did not significantly reduce adipocyte action (Figure 2A). Similarly, CCL5 inhibition led to a significant reduction of wound closure of CM-treated MDA-MB231 (Figure 2B). Conversely, IGF-1 receptor inhibition did not interfere with adipocyte-induced cancer cell motility (Figure 2B).Effect of CCL5 and IGF-1 pathway inhibition on adipocyte-induced breast cancer cell motility(A) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with or without human adipocytes in the lower chamber in serum free-medium. Co-cultured cells were incubated with 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Antibody (CCL5 Ab), 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 peptide (CCR5 pep) or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells without adipocytes in the lower chamber, incubated in serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (**p < 0.01). #denote statistically significant values over MDA-MB231-adipocytes co-culture (#p < 0.05). (B) Confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded by manually scratching and incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes for 24 h in presence of 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Ab, 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 pep or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by a digital camera coupled to the microscope and percentage of wound distance was calculated with the camera software. The results have been reported as percentage of gap closure at 24 h compared with time 0. A complete gap closure was considered as 100%. *denote statistically significant values over control (***p < 0.001). #denote statistically significant values over Adipo-CM treated cells (#p < 0.05). The pictures are representative of wound gaps at 0 point and upon 24 h of scratch assay. Data in the graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent triplicate experiments.Next, we addressed whether adipocytes may control CCL5 and IGF-1 production by cancer cells. To this aim, we have measured CCL5 and IGF-1 mRNA levels in MDA-MB231 cells following adipocyte CM exposure. Adipocyte CM did not induce any significant increase of CCL5 mRNA levels in MDA-MB231 cells, while inducing IGF-1 expression (Figure 3). The presence of CCL5-Ab or CCR5-pep did not reduce CM-induced expression of IGF-1, suggesting that adipocyte-released factors different from CCL5 may control IGF-1 production by cancer cells. Moreover, AG1024 treatment did not modify CCL5 expression in MDA-MB231 cells thus indicating that IGF-1 did not control CCL5 in cancer cells (Figure 3).Cross-regulation of CCL5 and IGF-1 in cancer cellsMDA-MB231 were incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes for 24 h in presence or absence of 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Ab, 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 pep or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Next, mRNA levels of human CCL5 and IGF-1 were determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis as described in Materials and Methods. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments. Bars show mRNA levels in these cells relative to those in untreated cells (cells in serum-free medium). Asterisks denote statistically significant values over untreated cells (*p < 0.05).CCL5 and IGF-1 detection in peritumoral adipose tissue of women with TNBCNext, we evaluated whether CCL5 and IGF-1 could be detected in peritumoral adipose tissue of women with breast cancer. We selected 40 invasive ductal TNBC samples. Patients\u2019 mean age was 59 years (range from 27 to 93); 12 patients (30%) were pre-menopausal and 28 (70%) post-menopausal. Tumors larger than 2 cm occurred in 52.5% (21/40) of patients. 95% (38/40) of patients had tumor with poorly differentiated cells (grade 3), while only 5% (2/40) had tumor with moderately differentiated cells (grade 2). None of the tumors was of grade 1. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 40% (16/40) of patients at surgery and 30% (12/40) of patients developed distant metastases. The expression of the proliferation factor Ki67 was high (> 30%) in 55% (22/40), and low (\u2264 30%) in 45% (18/40) of specimens. 17.5% (7/32) of patients were diabetic and 32.5% (13/31) had a BMI greater than 30 (Table 1).Clinical and pathological features of TNBC samples\tPatients (n = 40)\t \tAge\t \tMean:59 y (range: 27\u201393)\t \t< 40\t4 (10%)\t \t\u2265 40 \u2264 60\t17 (42.5%)\t \t> 60\t19 (47.5%)\t \tGrade\t \tI\t0 (0%)\t \tII\t2 (5%)\t \tIII\t38 (95%)\t \tSize (T)\t \t\u2264 2 cm\t20 (50%)\t \t> 2 \u2264 5 cm\t17 (42.5%)\t \t> 5\t3 (3.5%)\t \tLNM\t \tYes\t16 (40%)\t \tNo\t24 (60%)\t \tMetastasis\t \tYes\t12 (30%)\t \tNo\t28 (70%)\t \tKi-67\t \t> 30\t22 (55%)\t \t\u2264 30\t18 (45%)\t \tBMI\t \tMean: 27.65 (range: 20.03\u201337.92)\t \t< 30\t18 (45%)\t \t\u2265 30\t13 (32,5%)\t \tUnknown\t9 (22.5%)\t \tDiabetes\t \tYes\t8 (20%)\t \tNo\t24 (60%)\t \tUnknown\t8 (20%)\t \tFollow up\t \tNED\t16 (40%)\t \tAWD\t10 (25%)\t \tDOD\t3 (7.5%)\t \tUnknown\t11 (27.5%)\t \tLNM = Limph node metastasis; NED = No evidence of disease; AWD = Alive with disease; DOD = Dead of disease.CCL5 and IGF-1 specific staining was detected in peritumoral adipocytes of TNBC samples (up to 1 cm distance from the tumour). CCL5 staining in peritumoral adipose tissue was detected in 16/40 samples (40%) (Figure 4). Adipose tissue IGF-1 staining was detected in 20/40 samples (50%) (Figure 5).CCL5 IHC staining in peritumoral adipocytes of TNBC samples(A\u2013B) Negative expression of CCL5 in peritumoral adipocytes of a TNBC sample at 20\u00d7 (A) and 40\u00d7 (B) magnification.

CCL5 protein staining showed a positive, although not statistically significant correlation trend with Ki67 proliferation index (P-value = 0.085). Interestingly, CCL5 staining in peritumoral adipocyte was significantly associated with lymph node (P-value = 0.05) and distant metastases (P-value = 0.001) (Table 2). A positive trend (P-value = 0.095) between CCL5 immunoreactivity and fasting glucose levels was also revealed. No significant correlation was observed for IGF-1 staining in the adipocytes of TNBC samples with age, menopausal status, BMI, diabetes, glycaemic levels, tumour histotype, size and grading, Ki67 expression, lymph node and distant metastases (Table 2). CCL5 and IGF-1 staining was detected in peritumoral adipose tissue of 25 samples of ER positive patients whose clinical and pathological features have been described in Supplementary Table 1. CCL5 was detected in 19/25 samples (76%), while IGF-1 in 22/25 samples (88%) (data not shown).

At variance, IGF-1 peritumoral adipocyte staining was not associated with the overall survival (P-value = 0.909) (Figure 6B).CCL5 and IGF-1 Kaplan-Meier overall survival curvesGreen lines represent patients expressing CCL5 (A) or IGF-1 (B) in peritumoral adipose tissue.

In cancer, the coordinated intercellular interactions are disrupted as the tumor acquires the capacity to chronically circumvent normalizing cues from the microenvironment, and in turn, the microenvironment evolves to accommodate the growing tumor.We have addressed whether peritumoral adipose tissue may modify cancer cell invasiveness. For this purpose, we have used Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells (which stain negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2) and human mammary adipocytes. TNBCs account for 10\u201324% of invasive breast cancers and are typically high-grade tumors with different histological types. Usually, patients with TNBC have a higher recurrence rate after diagnosis, a short disease-free interval and a reduced overall survival, mainly for the lack of targeted therapies.Adipocytes are active and important modulators of mammary tumor microenvironment. Data mainly obtained in cultured murine cell models have suggested that adipocyte factors, including a wide array of adipokines, cytokines and growth factors, promote survival, growth and motility of cancer cells.Here, we show that TNBC cells display increased motility and invasiveness when co-cultured with human adipocytes. Interestingly, raising glucose concentrations further increased the promoting action of adipocytes on cancer cell motility. As also previously reported by others, higher glucose concentrations per se may enhance breast cancer cell growth and motility, by providing fuel for the increasing energy demand. However, experiments with co-culture and conditioned media have indicated that glucose increases the release of adipocyte factors, which, even in lower glucose concentrations, are capable to enhance cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Thus, high glucose levels may facilitate cancer progression by acting either directly on cancer cells or indirectly on the surrounding adipose cells.These in vitro observations are consistent with the evidence that: i) the epidemic surge of obesity and diabetes mellitus is paralleled by increased onset and progression of oncologic disorders, including breast cancer; ii) hyperglycaemia represents an independent risk factor for cancer progression; iii) tumour microenvironment responds to metabolic imbalance and accounts for several modifications occurring in cancer phenotypes.All together these observations indicate that the adipose tissue within the tumour microenvironment may sense metabolic derangements and worsen breast cancer progression.When cultured in high glucose concentrations or with fatty acids, adipocytes release a larger amount of IGF-1 and CCL5, without changing the secretion of several other factors. We have now shown that CCL5 is needed for breast cancer cell motility and invasion promoted by adipocytes. Indeed, either blocking CCL5 with a neutralizing antibody or preventing CCL5 binding to its CCR5 receptor reduced adipocyte effect on TNBC cell motility and invasiveness. At variance, an IGF-1/Insulin pathway inhibitor had no effect on adipocyte action, suggesting that adipocyte-released IGF-1 is dispensable (notably, insulin is not released by adipocytes and is not present in culture medium).CCL5 is a chemokine that has been associated to several forms of cancer. Elevated circulating levels of CCL5 have been found both in diabetic and in obese individuals. Nevertheless, CCL5/CCR5 expression levels are different among the different genetic subtypes of breast cancer and may represent a negative prognostic factor. However, tumor-derived CCL5 apparently does not contribute to breast cancer progression. It has been shown that CCL5 induces the invasion of basal breast cancer cells (i.e. MDA-MB-231 cells) but not of luminal breast cancer cells (i.e. MCF-7 cells). In agreement, increased CCL5 circulating levels have been found predominantly in ER-negative patients.Here, we have developed an immunohistochemical method to detect CCL5 and IGF-1 in tumor-associated adipose tissue specimens. This was a relevant achievement since very few markers have been analyzed in adipose cells through in-situ techniques. We were also able to establish an adequate evaluation score. Interestingly, in TNBCs, CCL5, while not IGF-1, immunodetection is significantly associated with lymph node and distant metastases. Consistently, a negative association of CCL5 staining in TNBC-associated adipose tissue with overall survival is suggestive of a more aggressive cancer behavior. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of a potential prognostic marker in peri-tumoral adipose tissue. Further work is needed to analyze the association between CCL5 and IGF-1 staining in adipose tissue and cancer features of patient with ER positive cancer.Most likely, CCL5 is largely produced by adipocytes. Indeed, no induction of CCL5 gene expression by adipocyte factors has been detected in breast cancer cells. Since CCL5 could act locally promoting cell movement, it could be involved in cancer invasion of the surrounding adipose tissue, which is one of the biologic indicators of tumor aggressiveness.CCL5 binds to its cognate receptor CCR5 and activates Jak kinases, STAT3, mTOR and p38 MAP kinase regulating the engagement of multiple signaling pathways. It mediates the trafficking and homing of classical lymphoid cells such as T cells and monocytes, but also acts on a range of other cells, including basophils, eosinophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and mast cells. Upon recruitment of immune cells, inflamed adipose tissue may further promote growth of malignant cells by inducing vascular endothelium and activating proinflammatory cells.Recently, genomic profiling studies have identified specific subtypes for TNBC with differential aggressiveness potential. These studies have evidenced that the Basal-Like Immune Activated subtype, which display up-regulation of genes controlling B cell, T cell, natural killer cell functions and inflammatory cytokines, was among the most aggressive molecular subtypes. Therefore, it is plausible that excess adiposity, as well as high blood glucose levels, may contribute to the production of inflammation/immunity-related factors, which may worsen cancer prognosis in metabolically deranged individuals. It should be pointed out that, although not reaching statistical significance, higher glycaemic levels are also associated with CCL5 detection in TNBC specimens. Further studies are needed to analyse CCL5 levels in serum of TNBC patients.Thus, we described that CCL5 release by adipocytes contributes to increase motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. CCL5 is detectable in peritumoral adipose tissue of TNBCs and correlates with lymph node and distant metastases and with the reduction of patient overall survival. This is a relevant issue since, so far, no effective molecular targeted drug is available for TNBC. In this regard, CCR5 antagonists are widely used for the treatment of HIV infection. Moreover, in animal models, CCL5 knockout does not affect general physiology and broad immunity, suggesting that specific targeted inhibition may have strong therapeutic impact without over-toxicity.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsMedia, sera, and antibiotics for cell culture were from Lonza (Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). Anti-CCL5 and IGF1 antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-Er\u03b1, PR, c-Erb B2 and Ki67 antibodies were purchased from DAKO (Ely, UK). All the other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).Peptide synthesisThe synthesis of peptide CCR5-pep (sequence: AFDWTFVPSLIL-NH2) was performed according to the solid-phase approach using standard Fmoc methodology in a manual reaction vessel. N\u03b1-Fmoc-protected amino acids, Rinkamide-resin, N-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt), 2-(1Hbenzotriazole-1-yl)21,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), N, N-diisopropylethyl-amine (DIPEA), piperidine and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Iris Biotech (Germany). Peptide synthesis solvents, reagents, as well as CH3CN for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were reagent grade and were acquired from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The first amino acid, N\u03b1Fmoc-Leu-OH was linked on to the Rink resin (100\u2013200 mesh, 1% divinylbenzene, 0.75 mmol/g) previously deprotected by a 25% piperidine solution in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 30 min.The following protected amino acids were then added stepwise: N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ile-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Leu-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ser(tBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Pro-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Val-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Phe-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Thr(tBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Asp(OtBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ala-OH,. Each coupling reaction was accomplished using a threefold excess of amino acid with HBTU and HOBt in the presence of DIPEA (6 eq.). The Na-Fmoc protecting groups were removed by treating the protected peptide resin with a 25% solution of piperidine in DMF (1 \u00d7 5 min and 1 \u00d7 25 min).The peptide resin was washed three times with DMF, and the next coupling step was initiated in a stepwise manner. The peptide resin was washed with dichloromethane (DCM) (3\u00d7), DMF (3\u00d7), and DCM (3\u00d7), and the deprotection protocol was repeated after each coupling step. In addition, after each step of deprotection and after each coupling step, Kaiser test was performed to confirm the complete removal of the Fmoc protecting group, respectively, and to verify that complete coupling has occurred on all the free amines on the resin.The N-terminal Fmoc group was removed as described above, and the peptide was released from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane(iPr3SiH)/H2O (90:5:5) for 3 h. The resin was removed by filtration, and the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with cold anhydrous ethyl ether to give a white powder and then lyophilized.Purification and characterizationAll crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a semipreparative C18-bonded silica column (Phenomenex, Jupiter, 250 mm 3 10 mm) using a Shimadzu SPD 10A UV/VIS detector, with detection at 210 and 254 nm.The column was perfused at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 40 min with solvent A (10%, vol/vol, water in 0.1% aqueous TFA), and a linear gradient from 10 to 90% of solvent B (80%, vol/vol, acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous TFA). Analytical purity and retention time (tR) of each peptide were determined using HPLC conditions in the above solvent system (solvents A and B) programmed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient from 10 to 90% B over 25 min, fitted with C-18 column Phenomenex, Juppiter C-18 column (250 mm 3 4.60 mm; 5 mm).All analogues showed > 97% purity when monitored at 215 nm. Homogeneous fractions, as established using analytical HPLC, were pooled and lyophilized.Peptides molecular weights were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI-MS analysis in positive ion mode were made using a Finnigan liquid chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry (LCQ) ion trap instrument, manufactured by Thermo Finnigan (San Jose, CA), equipped with the Excalibur software for processing the data acquired. The sample was dissolved in a mixture of water and methanol (50/50) and injected directly into the electrospray source, using a syringe pump, which maintains constant flow at 5 ml/min. The temperature of the capillary was set at 220\u00b0C.Cell culturesMDA-MB-231 (ER\u03b1, PgR and HER2 negative) and MCF-7 (ER\u03b1, PgR positive and HER2 negative) human breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin. Cultures were kept in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 C. Human adipose tissue samples were obtained from mammary adipose tissue biopsies of healthy women (n = 12; age 25\u201363 years; BMI 24.2\u201329.0) undergoing surgical mammary reduction. All women were otherwise healthy and free of metabolic or endocrine diseases. Informed consent was obtained from every subject before the surgical procedure. The ethical committee of the University of Naples approved this procedure. Adipose tissue was digested with collagenase and Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction cells (SVF) were isolated and differentiated as previously reported. Conditioned media (CM) were obtained by incubating the cells for 8 h with serum-free DMEM 0.25% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) after two washes with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). After the incubation, medium was collected and centrifuged at 14000 g to remove cellular debris and placed onto recipient cells.Co-culture and invasion assayCell invasiveness was examined using a reconstituted extracellular matrix (1.5 mg/ml Matrigel; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) coated on polycarbonate membranes of the upper compartment of a 24 well transwell system (8 \u03bcm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA). 24 h serum-starved MDA-MB231 cells (1 \u00d7 103 cells/well) were seeded on the matrigel-coated membrane and co-cultivated with either differentiated adipocytes or with undifferentiated SVF cells in the bottom chamber in serum-free medium. Alternatively, adipocyte CM was placed in the bottom of the transwell. Then, cells were allowed to invade the matrix and migrate into the lower chamber at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere saturated with H2O for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the upper surface of the membrane was swiped to remove the attached cells. The cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed with 11% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet-20% methanol for 20 min at room temperature. After three PBS washes and complete drying at room temperature, the crystal violet was solubilized by immersing the filters in 10% acetic acid. The concentration of the solubilized crystal violet was evaluated as absorbance at 540 nm.Scratch assayScratch assay was performed as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB231 cells were starved in serum-free DMEM-F12 0.25% BSA for 16 h. Confluent monolayers were wounded by manually scratching with a p20 pipette tip. They were next washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 C with mitomycin C (10 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and adipocyte CM. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by the Olympus DP20 microscope digital camera system (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and percentage of closure was calculated with a dedicated software.Real-time RT-PCR analysisTotal RNA was isolated from MDA-MB231 cells by using the Rneasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 1 \u03bcg RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using an iCycler IQ multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All reactions were performed in triplicate and \u03b2-actin was used as an internal standard.

These patients were different from those ones enrolled for adipose tissue biopsies. As for Institutional statistics, TNBCs represent 15\u201319% of the total number of breast cancer surgical samples. All cases of TNBC samples were reviewed according to WHO classification criteria, using standard tissue sections and appropriate immunohistochemical slides. Medical records for all cases of TNBC samples were reviewed for clinical information, including histologic parameters that were determined from the H and E slides. The following clinical and pathological parameters were evaluated for each tumor included in the study: patient age at initial diagnosis, tumor size, histologic subtype, nuclear grade, nodal status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor stage, tumor recurrence or distant metastasis and type of surgery (for tumor removal). In addition, all specimens were characterized for all routinely diagnostic immunophenotypic parameters.Immunohistochemistry analysisCCL5, IGF-1, ER\u03b1, PR, c-ErbB and KI67 staining was evaluated on slides of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides heated in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a bath for 20 minutes at 97 C. After antigen retrieval, the slides were allowed to cool. The slides were rinsed with Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) and the endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. After protein blocking (BSA 5% PBS 1\u00d7), slides were incubated with primary antibody to human CCL5 (dilution 1:100) and IGF-1 (dilution 1:500) over night and to human ER\u03b1 (dilution 1:35), PR (dilution 1:50), c-Erb B2 (dilution 1:300) and Ki67 (dilution 1:75) for 30 min. The sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 20 min with Biotinylated Secondary Antibody (RE7103, Novocastra, Nussloch, Germany). Then, sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 20 min with Streptavidin-HRP (RE7104, Novocastra, Nussloch, Germany). Peroxidase reactivity was visualized using a 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted.Immunohistochemistry evaluationTwo trained pathologists using a light microscopy evaluated antigen immunoreactivity independently. Observer was unaware of the clinical outcome. For each sample, at least five High Power Fields (HPF) (inside the tumor and in the area exhibiting tumor invasion) and > 500 cells were analysed. Using a microscopically semi-quantitative scoring system and referring to each antigen scoring method in other studies, we evaluated the intensity, extent and subcellular distribution of CCL5 and IGF-1.The proliferative index Ki67 was defined as the percentage of immunoreactive tumour cells out of the total number of cells. The percentage of positive cells per case was scored according to 2 different groups: group 1: < 30% (low proliferative activity); group 2: > 30% (high proliferative activity).There were no standardized criteria for CCL5 and IGF-1 adipose staining evaluation. We evaluated CCL5 and IGF1 protein reactivity in peritumoral adipocytes (until one centimeter from the tumor), considering only the positive or negative staining. CCL5 and IGF-1 detection in lymphocytes and macrophages was considered as internal positive control.Other routinely used diagnostic markers (ER\u03b1, PR and c-Erb B2) were evaluated as previously described.Statistical analysisThe Pearson \u03c72 test was used to analyze the association between CCL5 and IGF-1 staining in peritumoral adipocytes and clinical pathological features included in the study. The level of significance was defined as P < 0.05. Overall survival (OS) curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the significance was evaluated using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis (first biopsy) to death by any cause or until the most recent follow-up. The follow-up duration was five years. All the statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Science v. 20 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLECONFLICTS OF INTERESTAll authors have no conflicts of interest.FINANCIAL SUPPORTAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC n.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. TNBC progression is sustained by recruitment of a strong tumor microenvironment (TME) mainly composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) able to endorse tumor hallmarks.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay.

(B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3).

(C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027).

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of FAP, Caveolin-1, and MCT4 proteins in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs compared with control (scrambled [Scra]) after 72 h. (F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Accumulating evidence suggests that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit the growth of breast tumors by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen. However, it remains unknown whether the aromatase inhibitor letrozole has an additional impact on CAFs, which further influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Primary CAFs were isolated from primary estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumors. Estrogen-deprived culture medium was used to exclude the influence of steroids. In co-culture, primary cultured CAFs increased MCF7 cell adhesion, invasion, migration and proliferation, and letrozole treatment inhibited these increases, except for the increase in proliferation. In total, 258 up-regulated genes and 47 down-regulated genes with an absolute fold change &gt;2 were identified in CAFs co-cultured with MCF7 cell after letrozole treatment. One up-regulated genes (POSTN) and seven down-regulated genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, IL-8, CXCL5, LEP and NGF) were further validated by real-time PCR. The changes in CCL2 and CXCL1 expression were further confirmed using an automated microscopic imaging-based, high content analysis platform. Although the results need further functional validation, this study is the first to describe the differential tumor-promoting phenotype of CAFs induced by letrozole and the associated gene expression alterations. Most importantly, our data revealed that down-regulation of several secreted factors (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1 etc.) in CAFs might be partially responsible for the efficacy of letrozole. ",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min.

(B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm).

(C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay.

In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm.

MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay.

Data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test).DISCUSSIONHere, we showed that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed in both tumor and stromal cells, and that its expression in CAFs independently predicts RFS in patients with TNBC. Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), derived from stroma of cancer tissues, interact with cancer cells and play an important role in cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis. Nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is a 130 nm albumin-binding paclitaxel and recommended for many types of cancer chemotherapy. The nab-PTX stromal-disrupting effect during pancreatic cancer treatment has been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of nab-PTX in cancer cells and CAF interaction. Cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1) were cocultured with CAF or treated with CAF conditioned medium, after which their migration and invasion ability, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related marker expression and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) expression and secretion were detected. Nab-PTX treatment was carried out during the coculture system or during preparation of CAF conditioned medium. Then cancer cell migration and invasion ability, EMT-related marker expression, CXCL10 expression and secretion, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and secretion by CAF were checked After coculture with CAF, migration and invasion ability of cancer cells increased. CAF also downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated N-cadherin and vimentin expression in cancer cells. During coculture or stimulation with cancer cell-cultured medium, CAF significantly increased IL-6 expression and secretion. However, nab-PTX in the coculture system canceled CAF-induced migration and invasion promotion and EMT-related gene changes. Moreover, nab-PTX increased CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocked CAF IL-6 expression and secretion. Nab-PTX treatment could increase CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocks CAF cancer cell migration and invasion-promoting effect by inhibiting IL-6 expression.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of nab\u2010PTX in cancer cells and CAF interaction. Cancer cells (MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101) were cocultured with CAF or treated with CAF conditioned medium, after which their migration and invasion ability, epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT)\u2010related marker expression and C\u2010X\u2010C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) expression and secretion were detected. Nab\u2010PTX treatment was carried out during the coculture system or during preparation of CAF conditioned medium. Then cancer cell migration and invasion ability, EMT\u2010related marker expression, CXCL10 expression and secretion, and interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) expression and secretion by CAF were checked After coculture with CAF, migration and invasion ability of cancer cells increased. CAF also downregulated E\u2010cadherin and upregulated N\u2010cadherin and vimentin expression in cancer cells. During coculture or stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium, CAF significantly increased IL\u20106 expression and secretion. However, nab\u2010PTX in the coculture system canceled CAF\u2010induced migration and invasion promotion and EMT\u2010related gene changes. Moreover, nab\u2010PTX increased CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocked CAF IL\u20106 expression and secretion. Nab\u2010PTX treatment could increase CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocks CAF cancer cell migration and invasion\u2010promoting effect by inhibiting IL\u20106 expression.AbbreviationsCAFcancer\u2010associated fibroblastCXCL10C\u2010X\u2010C motif chemokine 10EMTepithelial\u2010mesenchymal transitionnab\u2010PTXnab\u2010paclitaxelINTRODUCTIONPancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer and only 10%\u201020% of patients survive more than 5 years after surgery.1 Pathological fibrosis in pancreatic cancer, which compromises drug delivery, impedes immune cell accessibility and promotes disease aggression and therapy resistance, is one of the key reasons for high mortality.2 Fibroblasts arising from tumor stroma, so\u2010called CAF, are the main non\u2010parenchymal cell related to the excessive stromal formation and interact with cancer cells. In pancreatic cancer, cancer cell\u2010derived cytokines activate pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) forming the CAF phenotype and contribute to pancreatic extensive desmoplasia.3 Also, CAF can secrete many kinds of extracellular matrix components, cytokines, growth factors, and proteases participating in tumor\u2010stroma cross\u2010talk. Recent studies showed that CAF could not only promote tumorigenesis, growth, and angiogenesis but also facilitate invasion and metastasis.4, 5, 6 Therefore, a new target for cancer chemotherapy is to interrupt cancer cells and CAF interaction.7 Nab\u2010paclitaxel is a new paclitaxel nanoparticle formulation in which the paclitaxel is bound to albumin. Nab\u2010PTX, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 as the first line in neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer, is widely used in clinical work and significantly improves outcome.8 Taking advantage of albumin\u2010binding, nab\u2010PTX efficiently accumulates in peri\u2010 and intratumoral areas dependent or independent of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) mediating.9, 10 Many clinical and animal studies showed that nab\u2010PTX treatment could disrupt tumor stroma, decrease PSC activity, and inflammatory cytokines.11 However, the role of nab\u2010PTX in tumor cells and CAF communication is unclear.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of nab\u2010PTX on CAF\u2010induced tumor cell migration and invasion.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell culture and treatmentPancreatic cancer cell lines MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). CAF were isolated from human pancreatic tissue resected from a pancreatic cancer patient by out\u2010growing methods as previously reported.12 The patient was newly diagnosed and had not received any relevant treatment prior to surgery. This was authorized in advance by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Tokushima Graduate School (approved ID number: 2790), and the patient provided written informed consent prior to donating the specimens. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with 10% FBS (Life Technologies Ltd) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. CAF were purchased from Cellular Engineering Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA) Cells were cultured in HLCAF.E.Media\u2010450 (Cellular Engineering Technologies Inc.) with 10% FBS.Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Abraxis; Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved with PBS. Cancer cells were treated with 5 ng/mL nab\u2010paclitaxel\u2010containing medium for 24 hours.CAF conditioning medium preparationCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts were grown with complete media in 6\u2010well dishes for 24 hours to reach 70%\u201080% confluency. The 80% confluency cancer cells (MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101) were cultured with 1% FBS DMEM for 24 hours and then changed to complete medium of CAF to cancer cells with 1% FBS culture medium for another 24\u2010hour culture. After that, the FBS\u2010free medium culture was followed. After 24\u2010hour culture, the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.2\u2010\u03bcm filter before use. For the CXCL10 or interleukin (IL)\u20106 of conditioned medium neutralization, CXCL10 (266\u2010IP; R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or IL\u20106 (7270\u2010IL; R&D) antibody was added to the conditioned medium with a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL and incubated for 1 hour before use.Migration and invasion assayTranswell inserts (Corning, NY, USA) of 8 \u03bcm pore size were used for migration assay and precoated with Matrigel matrix (Corning) for invasion assay. MIA PaCa\u20102 (5 \u00d7 104) or Panc\u20101 (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber, and 1\u20102 \u00d7 104 CAF were seeded in the lower chamber separately. After cell attachment, both chambers were gently washed twice with DMEM, and then the upper chambers were inserted and incubated with serum\u2010free DMEM. After 24\u2010hour incubation, the cells which moved through the members of Transwells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. The stained cells were counted under a microscope.Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assayLevel of IL\u20106 and CXCL10 was determined using IL\u20106 and CXCL10 Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a plate reader (SpectraMax i3; Molecular Devices, Tokyo, Japan) at a correction wavelength of 540 nm.Polymerase chain reaction analysisTotal RNA of each sample was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The following TaqMan assays (assay identification number) were used: CDH1 (Hs01023895_m1), CDH12 (Hs00362037_m1), vimentin (Hs00958111_m1), IL\u20106 (Hs00174131_m1), and CXCL10 (Hs00171042_m1). GAPDH (4352339E) was selected as internal control. StepOnePlus Real\u2010Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used to carry out qRT\u2010PCR.Cytokine arraySupernatants of cancer cells (Panc\u20101) with or without nab\u2010PTX treatment were collected, and the particulates were removed by filtration through a 0.2\u2010\u03bcm filter. Cytokines in supernatants were detected with a Proteome Profiler Human Cytokine Array Kit (ARY005B; R&D Systems). After blocking, membranes were incubated with samples and antibody cocktail overnight at 4\u00b0C. After incubation, the membranes were washed and incubated with streptavidin\u2010HRP at room temperature for 30 minutes. Chemiluminescent detection reagents were incubated with the membrane for 1 minute, and the signal intensities on the membranes were detected with chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfort, UK).Western blottingA RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing both the protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and the PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Tokyo, Japan) was used to lyse cells. Protein concentrations were then measured with a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and equal amounts of extracted proteins were separated on 10% SDS\u2010PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibody including E\u2010cadherin (ab15148; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), N\u2010cadherin (ab76011; Abcam), Vimentin (ab92547; Abcam), and \u03b2\u2010actin (#4967; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), followed by the appropriate HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were detected with chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).Statistical analysisData are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analyses were carried out by ANOVA or Student's t test by SPSS 19.0 (IBM, NY, USA). Student's t test was used to compare the difference between 2 groups. One\u2010way analysis of variance (one\u2010way ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test was used to compare the differences between more than 2 groups. P\u2010value <.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.RESULTSCAF promote pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasionTo investigate the effect of CAF on cancer cell migration and invasion, the cancer cells were cocultured with CAF for 24 hours. Compared with monoculture, cancer cells cocultured with CAF significantly increased the cell number transferred through the polyester or Matrigel matrix\u2010coated polyester (Figure 1A,B). Also, the conditioned medium derived from CAF which were stimulated with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (CAF\u2010CM) significantly increased cancer cell migration and invasion ability.Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) promoted pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. Pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101) cocultured with CAF (+CAF) or cultured in CAF\u2010conditioned medium (+CAF\u2010CM). A,B, Migration assay (A) and invasion assay (B) of cancer cells were monitored at 24 h (*significantly different from Ctrl group, P < .05, n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. C,D, PCR analysis and western blot for detection of epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition\u2010related gene (E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin) expression of cancer cells (*significantly different from Ctrl group, P < .05, n = 4)Epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition is essential for cancer cell migration and invasion.13 We detected EMT\u2010related gene changes of cancer cells after coculture with CAF or stimulation with CAF\u2010CM. Both coculture with CAF and stimulation with CAF\u2010CM decreased E\u2010cadherin but increased N\u2010cadherin and vimentin expression of both MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 (Figure 1C,D).CAF\u2010derived IL\u20106 increased cancer cell migration and invasion by promoting EMTA previous study reported that IL\u20106 is a protumor cytokine, which can promote cancer cell migration.14 To determine the role of IL\u20106 during CAF tumor cell interaction, we measured IL\u20106 expression and secretion by CAF. Results showed that coculture with cancer cells or stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium significantly increased IL\u20106 secretion and expression (Figure 2A,B). Next, we used an IL\u20106 antibody to neutralize IL\u20106 in the coculture system or CAF\u2010CM. After IL\u20106 neutralization, migration and invasion ability of cancer cells showed a significant difference compared with the coculture or CAF\u2010CM group (Figure 2C,D). Moreover, the epithelial and mesenchymal markers of cancer cells also appeared statistically different after IL\u20106 neutralization (Figure 2E\u2010G).Cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) derived interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) promoted pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. A,B, PCR analysis (A) and ELISA (B) for IL\u20106 expression and secretion of CAF showed that IL\u20106 expression of CAF significantly increased after coculture with cancer cells (MIA PaCa\u20102 coculture and Panc\u20101 coculture) or stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (Mia\u2010CM and Panc\u20101\u2010CM) for 24 h (*significantly different from Ctrl group, P < .05, n = 4). C,D, Migration assay (C) and invasion assay (D) for cancer cells cocultured with CAF in normal or IL\u20106 neutralized coculture system and stimulation by CAF\u2010CM with or without IL\u20106 neutralization (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. E,F, PCR analysis for epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition\u2010related gene expression of MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). G, Western blot for E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin expression of MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101Nab\u2010PTX canceled CAF\u2010induced cancer cell migration and invasionIn order to investigate the effect of nab\u2010PTX on the interaction between cancer cells and CAF, during cancer cell and CAF coculture, 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (this dosage had no effect on the cell viability of MIA PaCa\u20102, Panc\u20101, and CAF, data not shown) treatment was carried out during cancer cell and CAF coculture. After nab\u2010PTX treatment, cancer cell migration and invasion ability obviously decreased compared with that cocultured with CAF only (Figure 3A,B). Concomitantly, EMT marker changes caused by CAF were reversed after nab\u2010PTX treatment (Figure 3C,D).Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Nab\u2010PTX) canceled the cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF)\u2010induced cancer cell migration and invasion. A,B, Migration assay (A) and invasion assay (B) for cancer cells cocultured with CAF with or without 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. C,D, PCR analysis and western blot of E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin expression of cancer cells cocultured with CAF with or without 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). E,F, PCR analysis (E) and ELISA (F) for IL\u20106 expression and secretion of CAF cocultured with cancer cells with or without 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (*significantly different between 2groups, P < .05, n = 4)We showed that coculture with cancer cells or stimulation by cancer cell\u2010cultured medium upregulated CAF IL\u20106 expression, which might correlate with cancer migration and invasion promotion. Therefore, we detected IL\u20106 expression after nab\u2010PTX treatment. After coculture with cancer cells and nab\u2010PTX treatment combination, CAF remarkably decreased IL\u20106 expression and IL\u20106 protein level in cultured medium (Figure 3E,F).To determine whether nab\u2010PTX predominantly acted on CAF to downregulate IL\u20106 expression or on cancer cells to inhibit their ability to stimulate CAF IL\u20106 expression, we treated CAF with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium and nab\u2010PTX simultaneously (nab\u2010PTX1) or nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (nab\u2010PTX2) and then detected their IL\u20106 expression and secretion (Figure 4A). Interestingly, compared with stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (CM) only, IL\u20106 expression and secretion was significantly reduced in CAF treated with nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (Figure 4B,C). This showed that nab\u2010PTX acted on cancer cells to decrease their ability to stimulate CAF IL\u20106 expression. Then, the conditioned medium derived from CAF of nab\u2010PTX1 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX1) and of nab\u2010PTX2 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2) was used to stimulate cancer cells during a migration and invasion assay. Along with IL\u20106 reduction, the conditioned medium of CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2 did not increase cancer cell migration and invasion ability (Figure 4D,E). Also, change of EMT markers confirmed that CAF\u2010conditioned medium prepared with nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium had significant effects (Figure 4F,G).Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Nab\u2010PTX) functioned on cancer cells to inhibit cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) migration and invasion\u2010promoting effect. A, CAF were stimulated with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (CM) and nab\u2010PTX simultaneously (nab\u2010PTX1) or nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (nab\u2010PTX2). B,C, PCR analysis (B) and ELISA (C) for interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) expression and secretion of CAF stimulated with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium and nab\u2010PTX simultaneously (nab\u2010PTX1) or nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (nab\u2010PTX2) (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, N.S., not significantly different between 2 groups, P > .05; n = 4). D,E, Migration assay (D) and invasion assay (E) for cancer cells stimulated with conditioned medium derived from CAF of nab\u2010PTX1 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX1) or that of nab\u2010PTX2 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2) (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, N.S., not significantly different between 2 groups, P > .05; n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. F,G, PCR analysis and western blot of E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin expression of cancer cells stimulated with conditioned medium derived from CAF of nab\u2010PTX1 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX1) or that of nab\u2010PTX2 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2) (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, N.S., not significantly different between 2 groups, P > .05; n = 4)Nab\u2010PTX decreased IL\u20106 secretion of CAF by increasing cancer cell CXCL10 secretionTo detect cytokine secretion profile changes in cancer cells after nab\u2010PTX treatment, we carried out cytokine arrays of cancer cell (Panc\u20101) culture supernatants (Figure S1A,B). CCL2, CCL5, CCL12, IL\u201013, MIF, and PAI showed a decrease after nab\u2010PTX treatment and CXCL10 showed a dramatic increase. It has been reported that CXCL10 has an antifibrosis effect.15 Hence, we considered that cancer cell CXCL10 expression promoted by nab\u2010PTX might decrease CAF IL\u20106 expression and cancer cell migration\u2010promoting ability. We measured CXCL10 expression and secretion of cancer cells after nab\u2010PTX treatment 3 times separately and confirmed that nab\u2010PTX treatment upregulated CXCL10 expression and secretion (Figure 5A,B). CXCL10 antibody was used to neutralize secreted CXCL10 by cancer cells after nab\u2010PTX treatment. After CXCL10 neutralization, nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell supernatant did not impede IL\u20106 secretion of CAF (Figure 5C,D). Subsequently, it did not cancel migration and invasion promotion and EMT marker expression regulation of CAF (Figure 5E\u2010H). Also, the cancer cell supernatant with or without exogenous CXCL10 was used to stimulate CAF, and IL\u20106 expression and secretion of CAF were observed. This showed that exogenous CXCL10 in the cancer cell supernatant could inhibit the expression and secretion of IL\u20106 of CAF (Figure S2A,B).Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Nab\u2010PTX) decreased interleulin\u20106 (IL\u20106) secretion of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) by increased cancer cell C\u2010X\u2010C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) secretion.

Cancer cell\u2010derived cytokines including transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u2010\u03b2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families or microRNAs (mi\u2010RNAs) could promote normal fibroblasts to transform into CAF.18, 19, 20 Also, cancer cells could maintain the CAF phenotype and promote functions such as proliferation, migration, invasion, or angiogenesis.21 In our study, after stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium, the migration and invasion\u2010promoting function of CAF clearly increased.Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts, the predominant non\u2010parenchymal cells in the tumor stroma, play a key role in tumor\u2010stromal cross\u2010talk. Many studies have shown that isolated CAF can promote proliferation, migration and invasion, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance in many types of cancer including pancreatic adenocarcinoma.22, 23, 24 IL\u20106, as one of the major proinflammatory cytokines secreted by CAF, involves the modulation of growth of pancreatic cancer. It has been confirmed that IL\u20106 is important for the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer.25 After exogenous IL\u20106 stimulation, cancer cells increased vascular endothelial growth factor, neuropilin\u20102, and MMP expression, which correlated with cell proliferation and angiogenesis.26 Therefore, high serum or tumor stroma IL\u20106 concentrations indicate advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis.27 In the present study, cancer cell migration and invasion ability were related to IL\u20106 secretion by CAF. IL\u20106\u2010secreted CAF had migration and invasion\u2010promoting ability but this ability obviously decreased after IL\u20106 antibody neutralization. Also, CAF IL\u20106 expression difference was found between cancer cells and nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cells stimulated according to the difference of migration and invasion\u2010promoting ability.CXCL10 is upregulated after immune and non\u2010immune\u2010mediated tissue injury involving tissue repair and remodeling.28 It has been suggested that CXCL10 is important in regulating the fibrogenesis response. A previous study indicated that CXCL10 knockout mice showed an excessive fibrogenic response to stimulation and exogenous CXCL10 inhibited fibroblast recruitment and subsequent fibrosis.29 Although it is commonly believed that antifibrosis of CXCL10 correlates to inhibit fibroblast migration, the effect of CXCL10 on \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin and IL\u20106 expression to prevent myofibroblast differentiation is also reported.30 In our study, after nab\u2010PTX treatment, cancer cells increase CXCL10 expression, and this CXCL10 might decrease CAF IL\u20106 expression and suppress CAF tumor\u2010promoting ability when the nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium was used to stimulate CAF.Even though the dose of nab\u2010PTX used in the present study was relatively low compared with the clinical setting and the dose of nab\u2010PTX in our study did not decrease cell proliferation, there were already some changes in transcription of cancer cells and inhibition of cancer cells and CAF interaction caused by our dose of nab\u2010PTX. It has been shown that paclitaxel could stabilize microtubules and reduce transcription regulator, such as S100A4, nuclear import to block metastatic\u2010related gene expression in cholangiocarcinoma cells.31 Also, low\u2010dose paclitaxel could increase nuclear factor kappa B expression and nuclear transition which, as a transcription factor, can combine with the CXCL10 promoter and promote CXCL10 expression.32, 33 In our study, we confirmed that low\u2010dose nab\u2010PTX could change the expression of the EMT\u2010related gene along with decreasing cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, CXCL10 expression was increased. Unfortunately, low\u2010dose nab\u2010PTX had no direct effect on CAF during cancer cell medium stimulation.There are some limitations in the present study. The dosage used in our study was not as high as that which is clinically adopted, but even the relatively low dose of CAF had an antitumor effect. The CAF we used in this study is derived from only 1 patient which might limit the external validity of our results. Also, in vivo experiments were not included in this study.In conclusion, our study showed that nab\u2010PTX could stimulate CXCL10 expression of pancreatic cancer cells which inhibited IL\u20106 expression of CAF and decreased cancer cell migration and invasion\u2010promoting ability.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThis study was funded by Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).Supporting informationREFERENCESCancer statistics, 2017Drug penetration in solid tumoursPancreatic carcinoma cells stimulate proliferation and matrix synthesis of hepatic stellate cellsPancreatic stellate cells: a dynamic player of the intercellular communication in pancreatic cancerCancer\u2010associated fibroblast exosomes regulate survival and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cellsCancer\u2010associated stromal fibroblasts promote pancreatic tumor progressionFibroblast\u2010mediated drug resistance in cancerPositron emission tomography response evaluation from a randomized phase III trial of weekly nab\u2010paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreasSPARC\u2010independent delivery of Nab\u2010paclitaxel without depleting tumor stroma in patient\u2010derived pancreatic cancer xenograftsSPARC independent drug delivery and antitumour effects of nab\u2010paclitaxel in genetically engineered miceStromal disrupting effects of nab\u2010paclitaxel in pancreatic cancerPancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts display normal allelotypesTransitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states: acquisition of malignant and stem cell traitsIL\u20106/STAT3 plays a regulatory role in the interaction between pancreatic stellate cells and cancer cellsCXCR3\u2010independent actions of the CXC chemokine CXCL10 in the infarcted myocardium and in isolated cardiac fibroblasts are mediated through proteoglycansNab\u2010paclitaxel plus S\u20101 shows increased antitumor activity in patient\u2010derived pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse modelsIncreased antitumor activity, intratumor paclitaxel concentrations, and endothelial cell transport of cremophor\u2010free, albumin\u2010bound paclitaxel, ABI\u2010007, compared with cremophor\u2010based paclitaxelRepurposed drug screen identifies cardiac glycosides as inhibitors of TGF\u2010beta\u2010induced cancer\u2010associated fibroblast differentiationReprogramming of normal fibroblasts into cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts by miRNAs\u2010mediated CCL2/VEGFA signalingIncreased fibrosis and impaired intratumoral accumulation of macromolecules in a murine model of pancreatic cancer co\u2010administered with FGF\u20102Hepatocellular carcinoma cells cause different responses in expressions of cancer\u2010promoting genes in different cancer\u2010associated fibroblastsBreast cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts in hepatocellular carcinomaStat3/Socs3 activation by IL\u20106 transsignaling promotes progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and development of pancreatic cancerIL\u20106 stimulates Th2 type cytokine secretion and upregulates VEGF and NRP\u20101 expression in pancreatic cancer cellsCharacterization of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and high serum interleukin\u20106 levelsCXCL10 and autoimmune diseasesInhibition of pulmonary fibrosis by the chemokine IP\u201010/CXCL10Immunomodulation by mesenchymal stem cells in treating human autoimmune disease\u2010associated lung fibrosisLow dose paclitaxel reduces S100A4 nuclear import to inhibit invasion and hematogenous metastasis of cholangiocarcinomaSabarubicin\u2010 (MEN 10755) and paclitaxel show different kinetics in nuclear factor\u2010kappaB (NF\u2010kB) activation: effect of parthenolide on their cytotoxicityMAPK signaling downstream to TLR4 contributes to paclitaxel\u2010induced peripheral neuropathy"

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

CAF PD-L1 expression according to the SP-142 and E1L3N assays was also significantly associated with TIL PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u00a00.001 for both), similar to the 73\u201310 assay (Tables\u00a03, 4). Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative RFSThe median RFS in CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively. The median RFS in CAF PD-L1-negative patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 47, 53, and 49\u2009months, respectively. CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N did not correlate with RFS (p\u2009=\u20090.058, 0.788, and 0.411, respectively).Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative OSKaplan\u2013Meier curves for the overall survival (OS) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. a OS curves in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the 73\u201310 assay. b OS curves in CAF PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the SP142 assay. c OS curves in CAF PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the E1L3N assayFigure\u00a05 shows the OS curves of CAF PD-L1-positive and -negative patients evaluated using 73\u201310 (Fig.\u00a05a), SP-142 (Fig. 5b), and E1L3N (Fig. 5c), respectively. The median OS of CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively. The median OS in CAF PD-L1-negative patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N were 60, 60, and 59\u2009months, respectively. A CAF PD-L1-positive status after evaluation with 73\u201310 significantly correlated with better OS (p\u2009=\u20090.029) in TNBC patients (Fig. 5a). However, CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated with SP-142 or E1L3N did not correlate with OS (p\u2009=\u20090.840 and p\u2009=\u20090.309, respectively) (Fig. 5b and c).

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

IntroductionTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) fails to express receptors for progesterone, estrogen, and HER2 (PR-/ER-/HER2-) and represents the most aggressive form of breast cancer. TNBC tumors exhibit an outer layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) featuring linear arrays of collagen radiating 90\u00b0 perpendicular from the tumor border. These collagenous structures serve to aid intravasation, expand the range of the primary tumor, and extend through breast parenchyma. However, the deposition mechanics of the linearized matrix are totally unknown. CCL5 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 5) is a member of the C-C chemokine family, and acts as a potent chemoattractant of T cells, basophils, eosinophils, and macrophages. It has been shown that the main producer of tumor associated CCL5 is not the cancer cells, rather the local mesenchymal stem cell population. The literature is unanimously agreed on the pro-oncogenic impact of CCL5 on invasive breast tumors. The presence of CCL5 in biopsy samples has been reported as a prognostic indicator for stage II breast cancer progression. Similarly, circulating CCL5 was seen to increase with the number of involved lymph nodes in serum samples from invasive breast cancer patients. As an intervention, monoclonal antibody injected intraperitoneally against CCL5 showed a reduction in mesenchymal stem cell-induced breast tumor metastasis in a mouse model. In vitro extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition studies have been used to test the influence of ECM produced by aggressive melanoma on the epigenetic conversion of less aggressive melanoma cells. Considering the unique striated matrix of the TNBC tumor, and its reported role in metastasis promotion, we adapted this in vitro model to recapitulate the cellular interplay at the tumor/host border. We also used this tumor border analogue to investigate cell types and molecular inducers responsible for creating pro-oncogenic breast cancer matrix.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Experimental Design The objective of this study was twofold: to apply established in vitro protocols to a novel, untested hypothesis, and to examine the subsequent findings on invasive tumor extracellular matrix. The co-culture groups were selected with special attention to creating an analogue of the invasive tumor border, while allowing for experimental control. The pathway of this work was defined by results from unbiased experimental design; hence, the explorative tone of the study.2.2. Cell Line Acquisition, Culture, and Co-Culture ArrangementHuman fibroblasts (HS-27), adipose derived stem cells (ASC), and TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231) were all purchased as cell lines from Lonza. Cultures of individual cell types were carried out under normal conditions (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2). HS-27 and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% PenStrep (Gibco). ASCs were cultured in StemMACS media (Miltenyi Biotech), with 1% PenStrep. Co-cultures were arranged per Figure 1A. Group (i) (cancer juxtacrine group) featured all three cell types combined, in equal number (9.6 cm2 = 50,000 total cells). Group (ii) (cancer paracrine group) had 25,000 HS-27 and 25,000 ASCs per 9.6 cm2 and an overlying boyden chamber containing 20,000 MDA-MB-231. Group (iii) (healthy group) had 25,000 HS-27 and 25,000 ASCs per 9.6 cm2.2.3. Matrix Deposition and Decellularization Groups were arranged as described in Figure 1A and cultured per the workflow in Supplemental Figure S1. Briefly, cultures were grown for 7 days. Every other day, media was changed to contain 50 mM ascorbic acid. In the experiments blocking and supplying CCL5, a monoclonal antibody against human CCL5 (kindly supplied by P.J.N., L.M.U.), or recombinant human CCL5 (Peprotech) was added daily to the media for a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL\u22121. On day eight of culture, plates were washed 2 \u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and decellularized using a 20 mM NH4OH/1% Triton-X solution, at 37 \u00b0C for four minutes. The decellularization solution was diluted by twice its volume of PBS containing 1% PenStrep, and then stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The following day, plates were washed 3 \u00d7 PBS, and prepared suitably for experimentation.2.4. ECM QuantificationOnce matrices were washed 3 \u00d7 PBS, protein was quantified using a PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), per manufacturer\u2019s protocol.2.5. Cytokine Array A pooled total of 1 ml media was taken from 3 replicates of each group on day five of the culture. Pooled supernatant was run on a Human Cytokine Array C5 (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA) per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Arrays were imaged on a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at an exposure time of one minute.2.6. Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Electron MicroscopySamples of decellularized ECM were washed with PBS and air-dried for 48 h. Using DimensionTM 3100 Atomic Force Microscope (Bruker/Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA USA), matrices were measured by POINTPROBE PLUS\u00ae (silicon tips, resistivity 0.01\u20130.02 \u03a9, PPP-NCHR-10). Images were analyzed using Gwyddion software (V2.55, Brno, Czech Republic). Roughness was analyzed using \u2018Roughness Calculation\u2019 plugin for ImageJ (2002). Sample preparation for SEM involved identical decellularization and washing, followed by fixation in 3.5% formaldehyde, and dehydration in grades of alcohol from 40%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. Samples were air-dried overnight, then gold sputter coated and imaged by Jeol JSM-6390 scanning electron microscope at 10,000\u00d7 magnification.2.7. Histology and Immunohistochemistry Biopsies of human TNBC tumor border were taken from 3 patients (per Technical University of Munich guidelines, ethics vote #2997/10) were prepared as paraffin embedded blocks and cut at a thickness of 70 \u00b5m. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed as previously described. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol, with anti-human CCL5 (raised in goat), FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) conjugated donkey anti-goat and anti-human collagen VI (raised in mouse), Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam). Fluorescent images were taken using a Zeiss ObserverZ.1 (AX10, Jena, Germany) and analyzed using ImageJ (NIH).2.8. Cell Reseeding and Imaging Decellularized ECM was washed 3 \u00d7 PBS, followed by fully supplemented media containing 20,000 MDA-MB-231 per 9.6 cm2. Cells were imaged under Brightfield microscopy every 24 h until completely confluent.2.9. Cell/Matrix Preparation for Mass SpectroscopyCo-cultures for groups (i) and (iii) were seeded and cultured under normal conditions using the cell quantities described above. Control arm: 10,000 MDA-MB-231 cells per 9.6 cm2 were reseeded onto the matrices and cultured for 24 h. The cell/matrix extracts were then solubilized in RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation) buffer containing protease inhibitor and processed for mass spectroscopic analyses. The cell/matrix extracts were then solubilized in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor and processed for mass spectroscopic analyses.2.10. Mass Spectrometry and Proteomic AnalysisFilter aided sample preparation (FASP) digest was performed on 10 \u00b5g of cell/matrix extracts, which were digested using a modified FASP procedure, as previously described. LC-MSMS measurements were made according to methods previously described (for details see Supplementary Materials). Quantitative data analysis was performed using Progenesis QI for proteomics. Gene ontology term analysis (molecular function) was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Qiagen) (QIAGEInc., ).The analyses of protein-protein interaction were performed by the software tools STRING 11 ().2.11. Qualitative Real Time PCRRNA extraction was performed using TRIzol\u2122 agent (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription and PCR were using a OneStep RT-PCR.Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primers for CCL5 from Invitrogen (Forward: GTGGCAGGCAGTAAGATAAACTTG, reverse: CAAAAAGCTTCCCCAACTAAAGC).2.12. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Two-tailed t-tests were run to directly compare two groups together, and ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons. p value of <0.05 was considered significant. 3. Results 3.1. Extracellular Matrix Formed under Juxtacrine Influence has Smooth, Striated Ultrastructure In order to evaluate matrix deposition, 3 co-culture groups (per Supplemental Figure S1A) were seeded, cultured for seven days, and decellularized. There were grossly visible differences between the matrices generated (Figure 1A). ECM formed by the juxtacrine cancer co-culture (group (i): adipose derived stem cells (ASCs), fibroblasts, MDA-MB-231 cultured in juxtacrine) had a glassy, smooth appearance, with a linear, striated structure. In agreement with the literature, linear collagen has been identified histologically in both canine and human breast tumor samples, specifically at the tumor border. In contrast to group (i), ECM formed by the paracrine co-culture (group (ii): ASCs and fibroblasts cultured in juxtacrine, MDA-MB-231 cultured in paracrine, via Boyden chamber) was sparse, with disorganized fibrils laid down in no discernable pattern. In the cancer cell-free juxtacrine co-culture (group (iii): ASCs and fibroblasts cultured in juxtacrine), the ECM formed a rich network of collagen in a mesh formation (Figure 1A). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the differing three-dimensional structures of ECM from groups (i), (ii), and (iii). AFM micrographs show the linear ECM generated by group (i) (maximum height 0.11 \u00b5m), the disorganized minimal ECM of group (ii) (maximum height 80 nm), and a thick meshwork of ECM from group (iii) (maximum height 0.13 \u00b5m) (Figure 1B). Quantification showed similar amounts of ECM secreted between groups (i) and (iii), and over 50% less ECM deposited in group (ii). (Figure 1C). Surface area calculation showed the matrix formed by group (iii) was the roughest, with a significant difference compared to (i) and (ii) (p = 0.008, Figure 1D). Cultures of only MDA-MB-231 under paracrine influence of either fibroblast or ASC did not produce quantifiable matrix (Supplemental Figure S1B), and reseeded MDA-MB-231 formed a uniform monolayer, without exhibiting enhanced invasive behavior (Supplemental Figure S1C). Only the co-culture of ASCs, fibroblasts, and MDA-MB-231 formed a linear matrix seen by SEM and induced reseeded cells into road-like structures (Supplemental Figure S2A). Given these significant morphological differences and ability to instruct reseeded MDA-MB-231 cells, the next stage was to test the protein make-up of the matrices produced.3.2. Striated Collagen VI Found in Tumor Border and Juxtacrine Cancer Matrix Proteomics analysis of reseeded MDA-MB-231 and matrix combined revealed a significantly higher proportion of collagen VI\u03b13 (yellow data point, Figure 2A present in group (i) compared to group (iii). Congruently, it has been reported that the invasive front of the TNBC tumor is made chiefly of collagen VI. The C-terminal breakdown product of the COL6\u03b13 chain (C5) is endotrophin; a pro-fibrotic, pro-angiogenic, pro-EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), chemoattractant, which has been seen to decrease the efficacy of cisplatin treatment. In this way, collagen VI can be thought of as a structural and signaling molecule. H&E stains of human biopsy samples of the tumor border showed long, well-formed extensions from the tumor into the parenchyma, shown histologically and schematically in Figure 2B. Immunohistochemistry on human biopsy samples at the tumor border revealed collagenous structures positively stained for collagen VI, and CCL5 (Figure 2C). MDA-MB-231 cells reseeded onto acellular ECM in vitro grew in road-like patterns, observed only on the ECM of group (i) (juxtacrine cancer co-culture). Cells grew in a monolayer on groups (ii) and (iii), as normal cell cultures appear (Figure 2D). We observed organized structures forming five days after reseeding on matrix from group (i), with some contiguous tracks spanning approximately 360\u2013390 \u00b5m (Figure 2E). While it is likely the reseeded cells are doing no more than following the physical three-dimensional (3D) linear collagen, it illustrates the unique physical relationship between cancer generated matrix and cancer cell behavior. Gene ontology term analysis on proteome of cells reseeded on the matrix featured \u2018cell cycle\u2019,\u2018cell movement\u2019, and \u2018post-translational modification\u2019 as the top three enriched terms (Figure 2F). Collectively, signaling protein analysis revealed a highly activated pathway of post-translational modification and protein transport to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (via GFM, MRPS12, RPS21, and SRP9), suggested circuitry to predict breast cancer outcomes (Figure 2G). Considering the high collagen VI level in the cancer juxtacrine matrix, it was important to understand, next, the paracrine signaling occurring among the cells of group (i) compared to group (ii) as matrices were being deposited. 3.3. Blocking CCL5 in Juxtacrine Co-Culture Disrupts the Linear Deposition of ECM A cytokine screen of the matrix deposition co-cultures (Figure 3A) on day five revealed an increase of CCL5 only in group (i) (Figure 3B). Increased levels of CCL5 through juxtacrine contact of TNBC cells with healthy stem cells has been described previously. Similar to our findings, CCL5 was not upregulated with cancer cells in a paracrine relationship to non-cancer cells. This establishes a unique cytokine profile at the juxtacrine level and is especially interesting to observe the same co-culture under CCL5-depleted conditions. By addition of a monoclonal antibody against CCL5 during the matrix deposition period in group (i), there was an increase of phase contrast under Brightfield microscopy of the cultured cells. A live/dead assay showed 100% cell viability coupled with visible isolation of the cell types from one another (Figure 3C). CCL5 is known to enhance binding of leukocytes and T cells via CD44 signaling, an adhesion molecule common in many cancers. These data infer a relationship where cellular juxtacrine binding is CCL5-mediated. Cells were cultured for the eight-day deposition protocol, then ECM was decellularized (as in Supplementary Figure S1A). AFM and SEM show that blocking CCL5 in vitro results in a disrupted, unorganized, homogenous layer of ECM, compared to its normal linear format when CCL5 is unlimited (Figure 3D). Maraviroc is a competitive CCR5 antagonist, given systemically as HIV treatment to combat CCL5-mediated CD44 signaling in T-cells. An in-silico test was run to demonstrate the reductive effect of Maraviroc on breast tumor growth rates, as a concept study for secondary drug application. From a cytokine perspective, Maraviroc may represent an alternative, non-hormonal drug treatment, which could specifically act to limit the physical construction of the linear matrix. The next important effect of blocking CCL5 to be tested is whether it affects the proportion of collagen VI in the matrix of group (i), and if there is any difference in the reseeded cellular behavior on matrix formed in CCL5low conditions.3.4. Blocking CCL5 in Juxtacrine Co-Culture Reduces Collagen VI and Reseeded Cell Oncogenic Behavior Addition of recombinant CCL5 to the healthy and cancer juxtacrine cocultures did not reveal an altered ECM morphology; matrices from group (i) remain linear and stain positively for collagen VI. Matrices from group iii retain their meshwork pattern (Figure 4A). While addition of recombinant CCL5 to group (i) did not significantly alter the levels of ECM deposited, or the proportion of collagen VI therein, blocking CCL5 served to drastically decrease both the amount of total ECM deposited and collagen VI (* p = 0.041, ** p = 0.0049) (Figure 4B). Linked to in vivo literature, a CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mouse model on the background of the spontaneous mammary carcinoma model (mammary tumor virus\u2014polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT)), significantly delayed the crucial early stages of invasive tumor development. Reseeded MDA-MB-231 cells on the matrix formed with a CCL5 blocker exhibited low positive staining of integrin \u03b21, and a normal monolayer culture without road-like structures. This finding differs to the cells reseeded on the matrix formed under unlimited CCL5; which formed road-like structures and showed higher positive staining for integrin \u03b21 (Figure 4C), significantly different after three days of culture (* p = 0.029, Figure 4D). Integrin \u03b21 is a known driver of TNBC metastasis, and a clinical prognostic of TNBC development, by promoting invasion, proliferation, and cell survival. It so follows that silencing integrin \u03b21 in vitro limits the oncogenic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells. The next step in this study was to understand the origin of CCL5, and the main producer of linear matrix.3.5. Fibroblasts Under Paracrine Influence of ASC/MDA-MB-231 Produce Linear Collagen VI Matrix While matrix produced by fibroblasts alone under the paracrine influence of fibroblast/MDA-MB-231 stains positively for collagen VI, it is irregular and in a random meshwork pattern. However, fibroblasts under the paracrine influence of ASC/MDA-MB-231 produce linear collagen VI matrix as seen under fluorescent microscopy (Figure 5A). qPCR reveals significantly increased expression of CCL5 in ASC/MDA-MB-231 co-culture, compared to fibroblast/MDA-MB-231 co-culture. Congruently, conditioned media taken during the matrix deposition period shows higher CCL5 presence in ASC/MDA-MB-231 media compared to fibroblast/MDA-MB-231 media. These data highlight a previously known finding; stem cell membranes bound to MDA-MB-231 cell membranes create CCL5. Taken collectively, there is evidence for an axis involving ASC/MDA-MB-231 signaling that produces CCL5, which in turn stimulates fibroblasts to produce striated collagen VI (Figure 5D).4. Discussion At the boundary of the primary tumor, there is membrane-membrane contact of cancer cells with the neighboring non-cancer cell populations. We hypothesize that the ASCs at the TNBC tumor boundary bind to MDA-MB-231 cells, generating high levels of CCL5. The resident fibroblasts react to CCL5 by forming linearized ECM. Our data show the striated ECM generated by in vitro co-culture is rich in collagen type VI, and able to promote integrin \u03b21 expression of reseeded cells. Moreover, the linear ultrastructure is dependent on CCL5, which the co-culture of ASC/MDA-MB-231 generates. Specifically, this study aims to connect the existing TNBC research on CCL5, linearized matrix, collagen VI, and invasive cellular behavior. The finding of linear collagen at the breast tumor border echoes multiple TNBC publications. \u2018Tumor associated collagen signatures\u2019 (TACS) was first coined in 2006, and represents a system of distinct layers of collagen, which radiate out from an invasive breast tumor. TACS1 defines the innermost layer, a densely packed shell of collagen. TACS2 represents the middle zone, made of collagen aligned in onion-like spheres around the tumor. TACS3 being the outermost, features branches of collagen diverging 90\u00b0 perpendicular to the tumor boundary. We present evidence that these linear structures are made of collagen type VI, a collagen isoform whose pro-oncogenic impact is recapitulated in vivo. Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 mice on a background of MMTV-PyMT show decelerated hyperplasia and primary tumor formation. The present study is limited by the two-dimensional culture model and use of only triple negative breast cancer cells. Similarly, the intervention is not in vivo and there is no pharmacological investigation. However, the limitations of this study represent future research focuses. These findings, when extrapolated to the clinic, could inform diagnostics, as well as medical or surgical treatment of TNBC. A pivoted role of the anti-CCL5 HIV drug Maraviroc could feasibly integrate into TNBC treatment. Its potential has been identified and even patented for TNBC therapy since 2012 (patent #CA2873743A1). Investigation into CCL5 and breast density could inform radiologists on difficult imaging cases, considering the desmoplastic milieu created by radiotherapy. There is a known linearized matrix in breast cancer, which we have seen in vitro is formed chiefly by fibroblasts under CCL5 signaling. The striated structure of the matrix allows for oncogenic cell behavior and is disrupted by blocking CCL5 in vitro during matrix deposition. This represents an unreported role of CCL5 in specific ECM construction, which stands to illuminate ways of surgically excising, diagnosing, and treating invasive breast cancer.

Despite significant advancements in the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, there is still no licensed targeted therapy available for the treatment of TNBC, and therefore little improvement in survival has been observed for this patient population over the last years. This highlights the need for better understanding of TNBC and identification of mechanisms involved in disease progression and treatment response.It is now well recognized that breast cancer progression can be influenced by a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment surrounding the malignant epithelial cells. This environment consists of a heterogeneous mixture of stromal cells, including a diversity of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a biological active network comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM), in addition to the interstitial fluid and its solutes. New knowledge about the components of the microenvironment and how they interact with tumor cells can hopefully identify new biomarkers or potential targets in TNBC.The aberrant stroma affects the physiological forces within the tumor. Indeed, the hydrostatic pressure in the tumor interstitium, known as interstitial fluid pressure (PIF), is considerably increased in the majority of solid tumors, including human breast cancer, and this poses a major physiological barrier to transport of soluble factors within the tumor.Increased PIF has been shown to predict poor prognosis in some solid tumors, and can also hinder effective delivery of drugs into the tumor. Finding ways to lower tumor PIF may therefore increase efficiency of cancer therapy.Fibroblasts can actively modify PIF and transcapillary fluid exchange (reviewed in) and the molecular mechanisms are outlined by collagen contraction assays and heterospheroids, as well as parallel in vivo experiments. Dysfunctional blood and lymph vessels will lead to fluid accumulation in the tumor interstitium, and swelling of hyaluronan and proteoglycans would in normal conditions hinder an increase in PIF. Tension exerted by fibroblasts and collagen network can probably counteract this swelling, resulting in a persistent increased PIF. However, although fibroblast-mediated contraction has previous been shown to be dependent on \u03b21-integrins, fibroblast-mediated PIF influence is still not fully understood.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is a collagen binding integrin expressed during differentiation of myofibroblasts and is involved in collagen organization and tumor stiffness. As a collagen organizer and a link between contractile fibroblasts and the complex collagen network, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 could be a regulator of tumor PIF. Although a few studies indicate that it has a physiological role in the regulation of PIF in dermis, its influence on PIF in tumors remains to be demonstrated. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate pressure homeostasis within a tumor, can probably lead to a new insight into breast carcinogenesis, and we therefore investigated the effect of stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency on pressure homeostasis, ECM organization and tumor growth using two human TNBC xenograft models.MethodsCell linesMDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) was provided by Professor James Lorens (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway), and MDA-MB-468 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-132\u2122) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA., USA). The MDA-MB-231 cells were fingerprinted before use and matched with the cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) in the ATCC database. MDA-MB-231 was used at passage number five to nine, while the MDA-MB-468 cells were used at passage number two to five. These TNBC cell lines have high tumor take in SCID mice and slowly forming tumors, which may be more stromal dependent than more rapidly growing xenografts. Wild type (WT) and integrin \u03b111-deficient (\u03b111-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from mouse embryos of embryonic day 14.5 as described previously. In order to obtain immortalized MEFs, primary MEF cultures were infected with recombinant retrovirus-transducing simian virus 40 (SV40). All cell lines were grown in Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 100\u2009units/ml penicillin, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 1\u20132% L-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were grown as single monolayers in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and in all experiments used at log phase. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Xenograft modelsThe integrin \u03b111-deficient heterozygous SCID mouse strain was generated as previously described. PCR-genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from ear biopsies. The animals were kept in individually ventilated cages, cared for regularly and efforts were made to age- and weight match the animals. All animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Permit Number 20168751) which is the competent body responsible for authorizing research projects in animals in Norway. This is in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63 article 36.A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 or 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-468 tumor cells in 0.15\u2009ml PBS were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad (orthotopic), and for the MDA-MB-231 also subcutaneously on the mouse flank (ectopic). Tumor size was measured using a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula; tumor volume (mm3)\u2009=\u2009(\u03c0/6)\u2009\u00d7\u2009a2\u00a0\u00d7\u2009b, where a represents the shortest diameter and b represents the longest diameter of the tumor. All animals were anesthetized using Isofluran (Isoba\u00aevet. 100%, Schering-Plough A/S, Farum, Denmark) and eventually sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia. For investigation of the primary tumor, all the MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed day 57 post injection. For the MDA-MB-468 injected mice, some of the tumors showed tendency to ulcerate the skin, and these mice were sacrificed immediately. To make the groups comparable, one mouse from the opposite group and with similar tumor load was sacrificed on the same day.To evaluate metastatic spread to the lungs, they were processed and fixed as previously described (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 5 \u03b111-KO and n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 4 \u03b111-KO for the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 injected mice, respectively).All measurements and analysis in this study were performed blinded to genotype.Measurement of interstitial fluid pressureThe wick-in-needle technique was used to measure the tumor PIF. Briefly, a standard 23-gauge needle with a side hole filled with nylon floss and saline was connected to a PE-50 catheter, a pressure transducer and a computer for pressure registrations, using the software Powerlab chart (version 5, PowerLab/ssp. AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). The needle was inserted into the central part of the tumor after calibration. After a period of stable pressure measurements, the fluid communication was tested by clamping the catheter which shall cause a transient rise and then return to pressure prior to clamping. Measurements were accepted if the pre- to post-clamping value was within \u00b11\u2009mmHg.PIF in heterospheroids was measured with the micropuncture technique described previously. Briefly, the spheroids were collected and transferred to 10-cm Lysine-coated cell culture dishes (Nunc, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA., USA) and left to attach for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. PIF was measured using sharpened glass capillaries (tip diameter 3\u20135\u2009\u03bcm) connected to a servo-controlled counter pressure system. The glass capillaries were filled with hypertonic saline (0.5\u2009M) colored with Evans blue dye and inserted into the central parts of the spheroid with the help of a stereomicroscope (Wild M5, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). PIF in the cell culture medium directly outside the spheroid was defined as the zero reference pressure.Electron microscopy of collagen fibrils in the tumorTumor samples were taken from the tumor periphery and were fixed and processed as previously described. A JEM-1230 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the diameter and organization of the collagen fibrils, and images from four to six different areas of the tissue were analyzed. Pictures were captured at \u00d7\u2009100,000 magnification and analyzed using Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) to measure the fibril diameter. To investigate the organization of the collagen fibrils, pictures were captured at \u00d7\u200930,000 magnification and scored from one to four considering collagen fibril organization and alignment within the collagen fibers.A JSM-7400F Scanning Electron microscope (Jeol) was used to study the tumor collagen fibril scaffold architecture. Five images from different areas of the tumor were captured from each tumor at \u00d7\u200910,000 magnification.Immunostaining and Picrosirius-red stainingHistological analysis was performed on both paraffin embedded sections and cryosections. For paraffin embedded sections, 5\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were deparaffinizated and rehydrated, followed by heat induced antigen retrieval at pH\u20096 (#S1699, Dako, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA., USA) for Ki67 (100\u2009\u00b0C, 20\u2009min) and \u03b1SMA (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min), pH\u20099 (#2367, Dako) for Coll III (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min) or pH\u200910 (#T6455, Sigma Aldrich) for PDGFR\u03b2 (110\u2009\u00b0C, 5\u2009min). After antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated with peroxidase block (#K006, Dako) and then primary antibody. Envision+ System-HRP (#K4006 or #K4010, Dako) was used as secondary antibody, in addition to rabbit anti-goat for collagen III (1:1000, #6164\u201301, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL., USA), and DAB was used as chromogen, except for \u03b1SMA staining, where a FITC-conjugated antibody was used. Analysis of immunohistochemistry was performed using Leica DN 2000 Led (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The following primary antibodies were used on paraffin sections: rabbit anti-mouse PDGFR\u03b2 mAb (1:100, #3169, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA., USA), goat anti-mouse Type III Collagen pAb (1:100, #1330\u201308, Southern Biotech), anti-mouse \u03b1SMA mAb (F3777, dilution 1:200, Sigma Aldrich) and mouse anti-human Ki67 mAb (1:100, #M7240, Dako).Cryosections with a thickness of 6\u2009\u03bcm were fixed in ice-cold methanol (\u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C, 8\u2009min) and rehydrated with PBS, followed by blocking with 10% goat serum. Afterwards, the following primary antibodies were supplied: rabbit anti-mouse integrin \u03b111 pAb (1:200, custom-made, Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden,), mouse anti-human cytokerain AE1/AE3 mAb (1:200, #M3515, Dako) and mouse anti \u03b1SMA mAb (1:200, #A5228, Sigma Aldrich). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1:400, #111\u2013585-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ink., West Grove, PA., USA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:400, #315\u2013545-045, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. Mounting was done with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (#P36934, ThermoFisher). The staining results were evaluated under an Axioscope fluorescence microscope and micrographs were acquired using a digital AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Picrosirius-red stain (Polysciences inc, Warrington, FL., USA) was used for a semi-quantitative measurement of collagen type I and III as previously described.Evaluation of the stainingFor Picrosirius-red, collagen III, PDGFR\u03b2 and \u03b1SMA, a total of four to six pictures were captured from each tumor with \u00d7\u2009100 magnification. Images were taken in the tumor periphery in order to avoid the necrotic central area. The software Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) was used to identify the amount of positive pixels.For Ki67, the tumors were examined using light microscopy with an eye-piece grid at \u00d7\u2009630 magnification. A total of 500 tumor cells from the tumor periphery were evaluated, and distinct nuclear staining regardless of intensity was registered as positive. Areas with necrosis, bleeding or inflammation were avoided.MicrodialysisMicrodialysis was performed as previously described on the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors. Briefly, after anesthesia with Ketalar (Pfizer Inc., NY., USA) and Dormitor (Orin Pharma AS, Espoo, Finland), one microdialysis probe was placed in the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor (CMA12 Elite Microdialysis probe, ref.nr 8,010,434) and one in the jugular vein (CMA12 Elite Metal free, ref.nr 80,111,204). The probes were connected to a PE-50 catheter, perfused by a pump (CMA100 Microinjection pump, ref.nr 8,210,040) at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcl/min and left to stabilize for 30\u2009min. After intravenous injection of 0.15\u2009ml 0.65\u2009MBq 3H-5FU (Nycomed Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), dialysate was sampled and pooled every 10\u2009min for a total of 90\u2009min. Scintillation counting solution (Optiphase Hisafe 3, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA., USA) was added, and the radioactivity measured using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Carb 2900TR, PerkinElmer, Inc.). The probes and pump were delivered by CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden.The area under the curve (AUC) for the plasma and tumor was calculated with Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA., USA) as the total radioactivity collected, i.e. as the product of radioactivity (counts per minute) and time. Finally, transport of 3H-5FU was expressed as AUC tumor divided by AUC plasma.After each experiment, the probes were tested in saline with a known amount of 3H-5FU, and experiments with probes that differed more than 15% in permeability were excluded.HeterospheroidsHeterospheroids containing a mixture of SV40-immortalized MEFs and MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared using the hanging drop method as described previously. Briefly, sub-confluent cells were trypsinized and suspended in culture medium to a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/ml. The MEFs (WT or integrin \u03b111-KO MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 cell suspensions were then mixed at a ratio of 4:1 to make WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 and \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. Approximately 40 drops (25\u2009\u03bcl/ drop, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/drop) were dispensed onto a lid of a cell culture dish. The lid was then inverted and placed over a cell culture dish containing medium for humidity, and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5\u2009days.Statistical analysisSigmaplot 13.0 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL., USA) and Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) were used for statistical analysis. Either the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Mann- Whitney U test, was used to analyze statistical differences between the two groups. Results were accepted as statistically different when p\u2009<\u20090.05. Data are given as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and number of measurements (n) refers to number of tumors or heterospheroids unless otherwise specified.ResultsEffect of stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 on breast tumor growthTumor growth. The growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (a-c) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 and 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 MDA-MB-468 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad, and for MDA-MB-231, also subcutaneously (s.c.) on the back. All MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed at day 57 post injection. The MDA-MB-468 injected mice were sacrificed at different time points starting with n\u2009=\u200920 WT and n\u2009=\u200916 \u03b111-KO. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. ** p\u2009<\u20090.01. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (d) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmMDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 tumor cells were injected into WT and \u03b111-KO mice. As expected, we found that integrin \u03b111 was expressed in the tumor stroma in WT mice, but not in \u03b111-KO mice (Fig.\u00a01d). Furthermore, the immunofluorescent staining of integrin \u03b111 (Fig. 1d) did not show differences in the amount of integrin \u03b111 expression between the MDA-MB-231 orthotropic and subcutaneous model (n\u2009=\u20093\u20135). The tumor volumes in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors were significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in \u03b111-KO mice compared to tumors grown in WT mice during their 57\u2009days growth period (Fig. 1a). A clear tendency towards reduced MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor growth was also seen, but this did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.059) (Fig. 1b). Of note, there was no difference in MDA-MB-231 tumor growth when the cells were injected subcutaneously on the back (Fig. 1c).Tumor cell proliferation. The fraction of Ki67-positive tumor cells in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (a-c). Reduced percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells was only seen in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (n\u2009=\u20097 for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors, and n\u2009=\u20094 WT and n\u2009=\u20095 \u03b111-KO for MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors).

Scale bars indicate 100\u2009\u03bcmIn the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors, there was a slight, but statistically significant difference in the number of proliferating tumor cells, indicated by positive Ki67 staining (Fig.\u00a02a and d). However, in the two other tumor models, there were no significant differences in number of proliferating tumor cells (Fig. 2b-d).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduces tumor interstitial fluid pressureTumor interstitial fluid pressure.

Reduced tumor PIF was seen in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT, but no difference was seen in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors. * p\u2009<\u20090.05The tumor PIF was measured by the wick-in-needle method. PIF was significantly reduced in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (Fig.\u00a03a-b). No difference in PIF was seen in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 3c).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency perturbs collagen structureCollagen amount. The total fraction of Picrosirius-red and collagen III positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Representative images of Picrosirius-red staining of sections from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (c).

Transmission electron microscopy pictures from the xenograft tumors were scored from 1 to 4 according to collagen organization. The average collagen organization score per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) were lower in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (n\u2009=\u20098 WT and n\u2009=\u20097 \u03b111-KO mice in both models). No difference was found in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (c) (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. * p\u2009<\u20090.05, ** p\u2009<\u20090.01. Examples of the different scoring values from MDA-MB-468 tumors are shown in (d) (1- highly disorganized, 2-moderately disorganized, 3-moderately organized and 4-highly organized). Scale bars indicate 0.5\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril diameter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze collagen fibrils. Collagen fibril diameter distribution and average fibril diameter per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (n\u2009=\u20097) (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (n\u2009=\u20097) (b) showed a shift towards thinner fibrils in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT. No difference was seen in MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (c) (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. * p\u2009<\u20090.05. Representative TEM images of collagen fibrils in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in both genotypes (d). Scale bars indicate 0.2\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril architecture. Representative scanning electron images of collagen fibrils in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and n\u2009=\u20094 \u03b111-KO in both models). Scale bar indicates 1\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril organization and structure in the xenograft tumors were investigated using TEM. As seen in Fig.\u00a05a-b and d, integrin \u03b111-deficiency lead to more disorganized collagen fibril architecture with fewer aligned collagen fibrils in both the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor models. In these tumors, there was also a shift towards thinner collagen fibrils in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice (Fig. 6a-b and d). No difference was seen in either collagen fibril alignment or collagen fibril diameter in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors when comparing \u03b111-KO mice with WT (Figs. 5c and 6c). In addition, SEM did not demonstrate visual differences in the collagen fibril structure between tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice versus WT (Fig. 7).\u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2. The total fraction of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), \u03b1SMA (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (c). Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmImmunostaining of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2, common markers of activated fibroblasts and pericytes, was used to quantify the relative amount of activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. Although integrin \u03b111 partially co-localized with \u03b1SMA in xenograft tumors in WT mice (Fig. 8c), no significant differences in the amount of PDGFR\u03b2 or \u03b1SMA expression (Fig. 8a-b and Additional file 1: Figure S1) in tumors in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice were found.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 does not affect uptake of 3H-5FUMicrodialysis. Dialysate was sampled for 90\u2009min after i.v. injection of 3H-5FU, and the ratio between 3H-5FU level in plasma and in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor was calculated as Area Under Curve (AUC). There was no significant difference in uptake when WT and \u03b111-KO mice were compared (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDThe reduced tumor PIF found in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice was not associated with increased uptake of 3H-5FU measured by microdialysis (Fig. 9).Pressure homeostasis and integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in heterospheroidsHeterospheroids. The individual interstitial fluid pressures (PIF) in heterospheroids containing a mixture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells (4:1) (a). \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids showed a significant reduction in PIF compared to WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. *** p\u2009<\u20090.001. Transmission electron microscopy images show collagen fibrils in both heterospheroid types (b)Since the in vivo results demonstrate that stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining pressure homeostasis in triple-negative breast xenograft tumors, we also investigated the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on tumor PIF in a simplified system. Spheroids composed of fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b111 grown together with MDA-MB-231 cells had significantly lower PIF compared to spheroids with MDA-MB-231 cells and WT fibroblasts (Fig. 10a-b). These data indicate that the difference in PIF is, at least in part, due to integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Tumor metastasesNo lung metastases were seen when investigating coronal HE stained sections from lungs at end stage.DiscussionIntegrins are essential adhesion receptors necessary for intercellular communication, attachment of cells to the ECM and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we have demonstrated that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency markedly decreased PIF in vivo using two orthotopic human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. A perturbed collagen structure was seen, with fewer aligned and thinner collagen fibrils. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency impeded orthotopic breast tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 model, and the same trend was also found in the MDA-MB-468 orthotopic model. By investigating the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on MDA-MB-231 tumor cells in vitro, we provide here evidence that PIF regulation is, at least partly, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has arisen as a possible marker of a pro-tumorigenic subset of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in the stroma of lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Further, it stimulates lung cancer cell growth in vitro, and lung and prostate cancer growth in vivo. However, its role in tumor growth and progression is still not clear, especially in breast tumors where we recently reported that it did not affect the growth of the murine TNBC cell line 4\u2009T1 in vivo.In the present study, we found that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to reduced tumor PIF in both orthotopic xenograft models. This demonstrates for the first time that integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining an elevated PIF in solid tumors. A dense ECM, contractile fibroblasts, leaky blood vessels and dysfunctional lymphatic drainage are possible causes of increased PIF in tumors. PIF can be actively modulated through interactions between contractile fibroblasts and ECM molecules, where fibroblasts have been proposed to normally exert a tension on the collagen network through collagen-binding integrins. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 contracts collagen matrices experimentally, and we therefore suggest that integrin \u03b111\u03b21-mediated PIF modifications can involve a contraction of the interstitial space mediated by direct or indirect binding of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts to collagen.The involvement of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts in tumor PIF homeostasis is supported by our study of heterospheroids, where we observed a similar PIF reduction in spheroids composed of MDA-MB-231 cells and integrin \u03b111-deficient fibroblasts. This simplified system allows us to investigate how fibroblasts grown together with tumor cells can influence PIF. In line with our results, a similar integrin \u03b111\u03b21 function in pressure regulation has previously been shown in fibroblasts/lung cancer heterospheroids. However, although these avascular spheroid studies indicate that the pressure regulatory abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is, at least in part, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts, the mechanisms behind integrin \u03b111-mediated effect on PIF in heterospheroids are not investigated in detail in this study. In addition, we cannot exclude additional factors in the more complex in vivo system, such as influence of the tumor vasculature, which has been shown to have an important impact on tumor PIF.Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to less organized and thinner collagen fibrils in the orthotopic models, which could be a contributing factor to reduced tumor PIF. Although it has been shown that the collagen-binding proteoglycan fibromodulin promotes the formation of a dense stroma and increased tumor PIF, it is nevertheless difficult to predict how different components in the extracellular matrix affect the hydraulic conductivity of tissues and thereby fluid flow and PIF.Although the present study is the first to identify integrin \u03b111\u03b21 as participating in regulation of pressure in solid tumors, it is already known to maintain a homeostatic PIF in dermis. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated the function of \u03b21-integrins in the regulation of dermal PIF by inhibiting \u03b21-integrins.Numerous studies have highlighted the role of CAFs in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis, either directly by stimulation of tumor cells via production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors or indirectly by for example remodeling the ECM (reviewed in). Here we show that integrin \u03b111\u03b21, known to be expressed during myofibroblast differentiation, seems to facilitate breast tumor growth in vivo.In previous studies, the pro-tumorigenic abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 have been associated with increased matrix stiffness, collagen reorganization and increased levels of IGF-2. In the present study, changes in pressure homeostasis and collagen organization could both influence tumor growth and invasion. Of interest, increased tumor PIF has been linked to tumor aggressiveness in some human cancers, and is an independent poor prognostic factor in cervical cancer.There have been reports suggesting that increased tumor PIF can both facilitate and inhibit tumor progression. First, major pressure gradients due to increased tumor PIF can enhance interstitial fluid flow at and lymph drainage from the tumor margins, which probably increase the risk of cancer cells leaving the tumor. Increased flow can also facilitate tumor progression indirectly by either mechano-modulation of the tumor stroma or by changing the host immune response and thereby promote immunological tolerance (reviewed in). Further, in vitro elevation of tumor PIF increased proliferation of human osteosarcoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Similarly, in vivo lowering of tumor PIF, and thereby reduction of mechanical stretch for 24\u2009h, reduced tumor cell proliferation in vulva and lung xenograft tumors. However, contrary to these findings, increased tumor PIF may also limit uptake of nutrition and growth factors into the tumor and thereby inhibit tumor cell progression. In the context of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 cells have actually been shown to invade towards regions of higher pressure in vitro, indicating that the elevated tumor PIF may in fact restrain breast tumor invasion. In summary, these findings demonstrate that maintenance of a high tumor PIF may be a contributing factor to integrin \u03b111\u03b21\u2019s pro-tumorigenic effects, but at the same time, it can have opposite effects during tumorigenesis, pinpointing the need for further preclinical investigation.Although increased tumor PIF can be a major barrier in cancer treatment, lowering of tumor PIF by integrin \u03b111-deficiency did not increase the uptake of the low molecular weight drug 3H-5FU into MDA-MB-231 tumor interstitium. Low molecular weight compounds are transported by both diffusion and bulk flow/convection, and we have previously shown that reducing PIF can increase the uptake of the small molecular weight drugs 3H-5FU and 51Cr-EDTA into the tumor interstitium. However, in parallel with the results in the present study, it is evident that lowering of PIF will not always increase the uptake of low molecular weight drugs. Similarily, Flessner et al. showed that decapsulation of ovarian xenografts markedly decreased PIF to zero, but did not increase penetration of the high molecular weight drug trastuzumab into the tumor. In summary, probably other features of the tumor microenvironment can also contribute to the failure of transport within solid tumors.Our data show that integrin \u03b111-deficiency leads to thinner and less organized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumor stroma. Changes in collagen composition and organization are already known to influence tumorigenesis and can predict breast cancer behavior. For example, progressive deposition of collagen and increased collagen fiber linearization are associated with breast cancer aggressiveness.While integrin \u03b111-deficiency influenced tumor growth and reduced PIF with concomitantly more disorganized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumors, no effect was seen in the MDA-MB-231 ectopic tumors. Interestingly, there was similar amount of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression in both the MDA-MB-231 models. In a previous study, we also observed that while integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduced RM11 tumor growth, but did not affect 4\u2009T1 tumor growth, the integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression was not higher in RM11 than in 4\u2009T1 tumors. Thus, differences in integrin \u03b111\u03b21-expression cannot explain the contrasting effect seen in these in vivo models.The different effects seen between the MDA-MB-231 orthotopic and ectopic tumors show that tumor location significantly influences the effect of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in vivo. The tumor microenvironment displays a significant heterogeneity, and the subcutaneous location probably does not always give rise to a representative tissue-specific stromal infiltration. Supporting the fact that the organ-specific fibroblasts influence breast tumor growth differently, co-injection of breast fibroblast with breast tumor cells increased tumor growth, whereas no enhancement was seen with the co-injection of skin fibroblasts. The significance of the local microenvironment illustrates the complexity of in vivo studies, and may explain some of the discrepancies seen with different mouse models. This underlines the importance of choosing the appropriate preclinical model, particularly when investigating the tumor microenvironment. If possible, orthotopic models should be preferred rather than ectopic ones.ConclusionOur findings indicate an important role for integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in interstitial fluid pressure regulation in the breast tumor microenvironment. Further, since integrin \u03b111\u03b21 seems to impede breast cancer growth, it may be an interesting candidate for stromal targeted therapy.Additional fileAbbreviations3H-5FU3H-5-Fluorouracil5FU5-FluorouracilAUCArea under the curveCAFSCancer associated fibroblastsDAB3,3\u2032-DiaminobenzidineECMExtracellular matrixHEHematoxylin and eosinHER-2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IGF-2Insulin-like growth factor 2MABMonoclonal antibodyMBqMegabecquerelMEFsMouse embryonic fibroblastsPABPolyclonal antibodyPBSPhosphate buffered salinePDGFR\u03b2Platelet-derived growth factor receptor betaPIFInterstitial fluid pressureS.C.SubcutaneousSCIDSevere combined immunodeficiencySEMScanning electron microscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerWTWild type\u03b111-KOIntegrin \u03b111-deficient\u03b1SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinAuthors\u2019 contributionsConceived and designed the experiments: HYHS LS RKR.

PCa is a chronic type of tumor that requires a long time for small lesions to become clinically manifested compared to some other cancers. Inflammation has been thought to be one of the key pathogenic factors for PCa and there is an association between chronic inflammation and increased prevalence of PCa. Furthermore, tumor associated macrophages (TAM) form a major component of the inflammatory infiltrates in both primary and secondary tumors and can release growth factors, cytokines and chemokines to regulate tumor growth and invasion. However, the detailed mechanisms how the interactions among stromal cells, TAM, and PCa cells could influence the growth and metastasis of PCa remain to be further elucidated.An earlier study suggested that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) may play important roles to influence PCa progression and invasion. In the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME), PCa epithelial cells can produce some growth factors, such as TGF-\u03b2, PDGF and FGF, to influence/activate peripheral stromal cells that result in transformation of normal fibroblasts into CAF. Subsequently, CAF can then increase in population through transforming from normal fibroblasts, differentiation from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells or by epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The important functions of CAF include the regulation of deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), epithelial differentiation, tumor inflammation, and wound healing. Ezer et al. demonstrated that CAF could mediate inflammation and angiogenesis by recruiting macrophages to stimulate angiogenesis, which may then promote tumor growth.The existence of aromatase (to convert testosterone to estrogen) and the finding of an increase in estrogen-to-androgen ratio in aging men indicated that estrogens, in addition to androgens, could play important roles in PCa initiation and progression. Animal studies also demonstrated that 100\u00a0% of rats being treated with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) plus testosterone for around 44\u00a0weeks had prostatic adenocarcinomas.Estrogen action is mainly mediated through its specific nuclear receptors that regulate transcription of target genes via binding to the estrogen response element (ERE) or non-ERE mediated transactivation, as well as non-genomic regulations. There are two major types of estrogen receptors (ERs), ER alpha (ER\u03b1) and ER beta (ER\u03b2). The two ER subtypes are structurally similar, consisting of the six common domains (A\u2013F), but encoded by separate genes (ESR1 and ESR2). Immunostaining indicated that ER\u03b1 positive [ER\u03b1(+)] staining was present in normal prostate stromal cells nuclei. The function of stromal ER\u03b1, however, remains largely unknown.It has been well demonstrated that cancer related inflammation promotes cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion through several pathways, including signal transduction activation, cytokines secretion and immune cells infiltration. The TAM, M2 type, are the major players that link tumor related inflammation and tumor progression. A variety of chemokines, like CCL2 and CCL5, have been detected in neoplastic tissues and associated with tumor associated immune cells formation and recruitment.Using the in vitro co-culture system and in vivo mouse models, we studied CAF ER\u03b1 roles in PCa invasion and found CAF ER\u03b1 could inhibit PCa metastasis via suppression of macrophage infiltration and M2 type macrophages formation. This CAF.ER\u03b1(+) \u2192 macrophages \u2192 PCa invasion pathway involves the modulation of CAF CCL5 and macrophages IL6 gene expressions. This finding supports the clinical observation that PCa patients with stromal ER\u03b1 have better PSA free survival rates.ResultsER\u03b1 in CAFs suppressed macrophage infiltrationER\u03b1 expression in CAF reduced the macrophage (M\u03c6) migration. a and b CAF ER\u03b1 reduces the migration of macrophages. CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 24\u00a0h. We then added macrophages in inserted upper transwells (5\u00a0\u03bcm pore size) for 24\u00a0h and then compared macrophages migration rate toward CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells. c 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) treatment can reduce macrophage migration in CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells and ICI182,780 (ICI) treatment can reverse E2 effects. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) or CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells were first cultured in media with 5\u00a0% CD FBS for 2\u00a0days, then seeded in 24-well plates, and incubated with vehicle, E2 (10 nM) or/and ICI (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h. We then added macrophages into inserted upper transwells (5\u00a0\u03bcm pore size) for 24\u00a0h and compared macrophage migration rates toward CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(+). Migrated macrophages were fixed and stained by 1\u00a0% toluidine blue in PBS. Quantifications are in right panels. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cellsEarly reports showed that ER\u03b1 in stromal cells could affect the prostate development. Another report showed that E2 plus testosterone treatment could stimulate the PCa initiation, however, the role of stromal ER\u03b1 in the later stages of PCa progression and how it may affect immune cell infiltration and PCa metastasis is not well studied. Although the positive expression of ER\u03b1 in the CAF is lower than in the benign component of human PCa tissues, the clinical correlation has been identified\u00a0and one study showed patients with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) expression have better PSA free recurrence survival rate. We isolated CAF from TRAMP mice prostate tumors, immortalized them by SV40 large T-antigen, and then studied how ER\u03b1 in CAF cells may affect the infiltrating macrophages. Using a transwell system of adding macrophage RAW-264.7 cells on the insert wells and seeding CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells in the bottom chambers, we found chambers seeded with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) had less macrophages infiltrated than with CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells (Fig.\u00a01a). Similar results were obtained when we replaced mouse macrophage RAW-264.7 cells with B6 mouse primary macrophages (M\u03c6) (Fig.\u00a01b). We also compared macrophages recruitment between CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) and CAF.ER\u03b1(+) with/without E2 treatment. Our results indicated that E2 treatment can further reduce CAF.ER\u03b1(+) diminished macrophage recruitment and treatment with ICI182,780 can reverse E2 and ER\u03b1 reduced macrophage infiltration (Fig.\u00a01c).Together, results from Fig.\u00a01 suggest that CAF with ER\u03b1 expression could reduce macrophage population in the PCa microenvironment.Infiltrating macrophages enhance PCa invasionEffects of CM from co-cultured CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) /macrophages (M\u03c6) on PCa invasion. The carton illustrates the PCa invasion transwell system. CM was collected from 48\u00a0h co-culture of CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) and RAW264.7 (RAW) cells (a) or B6 primary macrophages (M\u03c6) (b), co-cultured CM was added to 24-well plates and the PCa cells TRAMP-C1, CWR22Rv-1 (22Rv1), C4-2, or PC-3, were seeded into inserted transwells pre-coated with matrigel. After 24 to 48\u00a0h incubation (TRAMPC-1 and PC-3 for 24\u00a0h; CWR22Rv-1 and C4-2 for 48\u00a0h), invaded PCa cells were counted and compared between CM of CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophages and CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages. c Estrogen treatment further triggers CAF.ER\u03b1(+) reduced PCa invasion. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) or ER\u03b1(+) cells were treated with vehicle, E2 (10 nM) or/and ICI (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and co-cultured with macrophages for 48\u00a0h. CMs were collected and added to 24-well plates and the PCa cells (CWR22Rv-1) were seeded onto inserted transwells pre-coated with matrigel. After 48\u00a0h incubation, invaded PCa cells were counted and compared, and quantitation data is shown at right. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophages CM treatment groupTo further study the consequences of altered infiltrating macrophages on PCa invasion, we co-cultured mouse CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells with mouse macrophages and then collected the conditioned media (CM) to assay the influence on the invasiveness of mouse PCa cells (TRAMP-C1). As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, the CM from co-culture of CAF.ER\u03b1(+) and mouse RAW264.7 cells led a lower TRAMP-C1 cells invasion as compared to CM from co-culture of CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) and RAW-264.7 cells. Similar results were obtained when we replaced TRAMP-C1 cells with human PCa cells CWR22Rv-1 (22Rv1), C4-2, or PC-3 cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Furthermore, replacing mouse macrophage RAW-264.7 cells with B6 primary macrophages (M\u03c6) also showed similar results (Fig.\u00a02b). We also evaluated ER\u03b1 activity by E2 and ICI182,780 to confirm stromal ER\u03b1 role in PCa invasion. We co-cultured CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophages, CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages with/without ICI182,780 and/or E2 treatment for 2\u00a0days. CMs were collected to induce CWR22Rv-1 cells invasion. Our data showed E2 treatment can suppress PCa invasion but adding ICI 182,780 can partially reverse this decreased invasion (Fig.\u00a02c). We also observed similar results in C4-2 cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1).To mimic the in vivo tumor micro-environment, we applied the 3D invasion assay system to confirm the outcomes from the transwell invasion assay. In the 3D assay, the formation of acini-like structures counts as an indicator for invasion. CM collected from CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophages co-culture increased the CWR22Rv-1 cell formation of acini-like structures as compared to CM from CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages co-culture (Additional file 2: Figure S2A). We also found decreased laminin 5 (an indicator of increased invasion) in PCa cells cultured with the CM from the CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophages as compared to CM from CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages (Additional file 2: Figure S2B). Importantly, the expression of the key invasion marker, MMP9, was 2 fold higher in CWR22Rv1 cells treated with CM of CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/RAW264.7 co-culture than those treated with CM from CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/RAW264.7 co-culture (Additional file 2: Figure S2C) in this 3D invasion system.Together, results from Fig.\u00a02 and Additional file 2: Figure S2 using different invasion assays with different macrophages and PCa cells all suggested that ER\u03b1 in CAF could suppress PCa invasion at least partly via suppressing the infiltrating macrophages.CAF.ER\u03b1(+) suppresses PCa invasion via reduced macrophage infiltration in the in vivo mouse PCa modelIn vivo tumor model demonstrated CAF ER\u03b1 reduced macrophages infiltration and PCa cell invasion. Nude mice were orthotopically implanted with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) mixed with CWR22Rv1 cells that were stably transfected with firefly luciferase (22Rv1-Luc). a Tumors were collected 12\u00a0weeks after implantation, and macrophage infiltration was examined by IHC staining of F4/80 (M1 macrophage, upper panel) and CD206 (M2 macrophage, lower panel). b Pelvic lymph nodes were collected from CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/22Rv1-Luc and CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/22Rv1-Luc co-cultured groups to determine metastasis by measuring sizes of lymph nodes. We confirmed, by IHC staining of luciferase, the presence of 22Rv1-Luc cells in the lymph nodes (lower panel). There were seven mice in each group. We defined pelvic lymph nodes as metastatic when the diameter was over 2\u00a0mm (upper panel) *, P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/22Rv1-Luc tumorsTo confirm the above in vitro results in the in vivo animal model, we orthotopically co-implanted CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) plus CWR22Rv-1 cells. CWR22Rv1 cells were stably transfected with firefly luciferase (22Rv1-Luc) to monitor tumor implantation, growth, and metastasis using the non-invasive in vivo IVIS imaging system. Twelve weeks after implantation, tumors were collected from both primary and metastatic sites (Fig.\u00a03). We compared the infiltrated macrophages by IHC staining and found less infiltrated macrophages, including M1 (F4/80) and M2 (CD206) macrophages, in CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/22Rv1-Luc primary tumors than in the CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/22Rv1-Luc primary tumors (Fig.\u00a03a). We carefully examined the tumor histology, and found that in the co-implants of CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) and PCa cells, our data show tumors were big, cells were more dense, and necrosis could be observed in the central part of tumor (data not shown). We also found that 4 out of 7 CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/22Rv-1-Luc co-implanted mice and 2 out of 7 CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/22Rv-1-Luc co-implanted mice with enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, but the numbers of enlarged pelvic lymph nodes were variable in individual mice. Among those mice positive for enlarged lymph nodes, the CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) implanted mice presented larger pelvic lymph nodes than the CAF.ER\u03b1(+) implanted group. The length or width of nodes in CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) mice were\u2009\u22652\u00a0mm, but not in those CAF.ER\u03b1(+) implanted group. Thus, we used 2\u00a0mm width or length to define the malignancy of this metastatic PCa. To verify the enlarged pelvic lymph nodes were correlated to metastasis, but not inflammation, the pelvic lymph nodes were IHC stained for presence of luciferase. Importantly, this luciferase staining found fewer metastatic tumors in pelvic lymph nodes in mice co-implanted with CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/22Rv1.Luc cells (Fig.\u00a03b).Together, results from Fig.\u00a03 suggest that CAF.ER\u03b1(+) may suppress PCa invasion at least partly via altering the macrophage infiltration into PCa in the in vivo mouse model.Mechanism dissection how CAF ER\u03b1(+) suppresses macrophage infiltrationER\u03b1 reduced the CCL5 expression in CAF cells and consequently decreased\u00a0 macrophages infiltration. a We compared gene profiles of macrophage attraction related chemokines/cytokines between CAF.ER\u03b1(+) and CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) by QPCR. b The comparison of CCL5 production from CAF.ER\u03b1(+) and CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) was determined by ELISA through measuring CCL5 concentration in the CM. c CCL5 promoter luciferase activity was used to determine whether ER\u03b1 regulates CCL5 expression. CCL5 promoter (\u221283\u00a0bp)-luciferase reporter was transfected into CAF.ER\u03b1(+) and CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) and cultured in CD-FBS media. 10 nM E2 was added and CCL5 promoter luciferase activity was analyzed using a dual luciferase kit. d CAF were cultured in bottom wells and incubated with CCL5 neutralizing Ab or IgG (control). After 24\u00a0h, macrophages were added into inserted upper transwells that also contained CCL5 neutralizing Ab or IgG (control). Migrated macrophages were counted and compared to CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) with IgG as control. Quantification is in lower panel. e Adding recombinant CCL5 protein reversed CAF.ER(+) reduced macrophage migration. CAF cells were incubated with recombinant CCL5 protein or control for 24\u00a0h, and then macrophages with recombinant CCL5 protein or control were added to the inserted transwells for migration assay. All migrated macrophages were compared to CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) with control protein. Quantification is in lower panel. f CCL5 expression was confirmed by IHC staining in the in vivo mouse PCa tumors co-implanted with/without both CAF/22Rv1-Luc cells. Arrows show positive CCL5 staining. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/22Rv1 tumorsTo dissect the molecular mechanism(s) by which CAF.ER\u03b1(+) expression could suppress macrophage infiltration, we performed Q-PCR gene expression assays with several macrophage migration-related chemokines and cytokines, including the family of the C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) and interleukin (IL) genes. Our results showed that CCL5 and IL6 gene expression were significantly decreased in CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells as compared to those found in CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells (Fig.\u00a04a). We also co-cultured macrophages with CAFs to study whether macrophages can impact ER\u03b1 functions in CAF cells. The results showed that compared to CAFs alone, the co-culture of macrophages with CAFs resulted in increased CCL5 and IL6 expression in CAF cells. Consistently, higher ER\u03b1 expression in CAF decreased CCL5 and IL6 in CAF cells while comparing CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages vs. CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophages group (Additional file 3: Figure S3). The IL6 neutralizing antibody did not affect the CAF regulated macrophage migration/infiltration (data not shown). To further confirm CCL5 expression was altered at the protein level, we assayed CCL5 concentration in culture media using ELISA, and results indicated that secreted CCL5 protein decreased in CAF.ER\u03b1(+) media (Fig.\u00a04b).There are two identified transcription factor binding sites in the CCL5 promoter region, including binding sites for NF-\u03baB (\u221270 to \u221258) and (\u221255 to \u221242), and a SP1/KLF binding site (\u221270 to \u221258). Previous studies showed that through a non-ERE pathway the ER\u03b1 could regulate downstream genes activities, including NF-\u03baB and AP-1. We therefore focused on examining whether ER\u03b1 could modulate the CCL5 at the transcriptional level by characterizing the CCL5 promoter (\u221283\u00a0bp) that was constructed into a luciferase reporter. Our results showed that CCL5 luciferase activity is higher in CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) than in CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells (Fig.\u00a04c).We also applied an interruption approach to test if interrupting the CCL5 signal with CCL5 neutralizing antibody may block the effects of CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) on macrophages infiltration in the co-culture system. Our results showed the CCL5 neutralizing antibody could significantly and effectively diminish the CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) modulated macrophage infiltration toward CAF with less effect on CAF.ER(+) modulated infiltration (Fig.\u00a04d, quantification in lower panel).Then, we applied another interruption approach via adding CCL5 recombinant protein to examine whether the ectopic CCL5 could restore/reverse the CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells' low-capacity to recruit macrophages. Indeed, our results showed adding CCL5 protein could increase the low-capability of CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells to attract macrophages, indicating the lower CCL5 is a key factor that leads to lower macrophages attraction of CAF.ER\u03b1(+) (Fig.\u00a04e). We then examined the CCL5 expression in mice with in vivo co-implanted CWR22Rv1-Luc cells with CAF with or without ER\u03b1 (PCa:CAF\u2009=\u20099:1) and IHC staining of CCL5 data showed less CCL5 positive signals in CAF.ER\u03b1(+) than in CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) implanted group (Fig.\u00a04f).Together, results from Fig.\u00a04a\u2013f suggest that CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells have a lower\u00a0ability to attract macrophages due to a lower chemokine CCL5 expression.Mechanisms of CAF.ER\u03b1\u2009+\u2009suppressed PCa invasionCAF.ER\u03b1(+) CM treated macrophages have a reduced capability of producing IL6, which could consequently reduce PCa invasion. a We compared metastatic-related gene profile expressions by QPCR in macrophages after co-culture with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells. Macrophages were seeded in bottom wells, then CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells were seeded onto inserted transwells (0.4\u00a0\u03bcm) and co-cultured for 24\u00a0h. Macrophage RNA was collected and converted to cDNA. Selected metastatic related genes expressions in macrophage were measured by QPCR, RAW cells in left panel and M\u03c6 in right panel. b IL6 concentration in CM from CAF/macrophage co-inoculation was measured by ELISA. c IL6 neutralizing antibody blocks macrophages promoted PCa invasion. The next experiment compared macrophages that were incubated with CM either from CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212). PCa cells (CWR22Rv1, C4-2, or PC3) were seeded onto matrigel pre-coated transwells for 48\u00a0h to demonstrate invasive ability. d There is a lower IL6 staining in CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/CWR22Rv1 co-implanted tumors. Arrowheads show the cells that express IL6 protein. Arrows indicate cells positive for the ER\u03b1 expression. IL6 expression is reversely correlative to CAF ER\u03b1 expression using IF staining. *, P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. CAF.ER\u03b1-/ 22Rv1 tumorsNext, we examined the molecular mechanism(s) by which the CAF.ER\u03b1(+) affected macrophages could influence PCa cell invasion. As shown in Fig.\u00a05a, we compared gene profiles of both RAW-264.7 and B6 primary macrophages co-cultured with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells, and found lower IL6 expression in both types of macrophages after co-culture with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells. Although TGF-\u03b23 and Wnt 5\u03b1 expressions increase, yet their mRNA amounts and expression levels are not as high as IL6. We therefore set the priority to focus on studying IL6. We further examined the altered IL6 expression at the protein level via ELISA assay and data showed there is less IL6 in the CM from CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/macrophages co-culture system. This indicates that CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells have less capability to stimulate IL-6 secretion from macrophage RAW-264.7 cells (Fig.\u00a05b). As expected, adding IL6 neutralizing antibody into the CM diminished the CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212)/macrophage mediated PCa invasion of CWR22Rv-1, C4-2 and PC3 cells (Fig.\u00a05c). We further demonstrated CAF.ER\u03b1 signals-mediated CAF IL-6 reduction could also impact PCa invasion. We put CM that was collected from CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) or CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells with neutralizing IL6 antibody or IgG (control) into bottom wells, and seeded CWR22Rv1\u00a0or C4-2 cells into matrigel-coated transwell for invasion assay. Our results showed that IL6 neutralizing antibody can decrease CAF-induced PCa cell invasion (Additional file 4: Figure S4). In vivo evidence from orthotopically xenografted mouse PCa also confirmed the above in vitro data showing CAF.ER\u03b1(+)/22Rv-1 tumors have less IL6 expression (Fig.\u00a05d). We also confirmed IL6 and ER\u03b1 correlation by IF staining of serial section slides. Our results further indicated there was little IL-6 positive signal when stromal ER\u03b1 is positively expressed.Together, results from Fig.\u00a05a\u2013d and Additional file 4: Figure S4 suggest that CAF.ER\u03b1(+) may be able to lower the production of IL6 in macrophages, consequently reduce the macrophages-mediated PCa cell invasion.Correlative expression of ER\u03b1, M2 macrophage, CCL5 and IL6 in human prostate tumorM2 macrophages, CCL5 and IL6 expression increase in prostate cancer patients with high stromal ER\u03b1 expression. To confirm our findings in human prostate tumors, we also examined ER\u03b1, CD206 (M2 macrophage marker), CCL5 and IL6 in human samples by IHC staining. Samples were provides by Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical centerTo confirm our findings in human prostate tumors, we further examined the ER\u03b1, CD206, CCL5 and IL6 expressions in 14 human PCa tissue specimens by IHC staining. Our results showed a positive correlation between ER\u03b1, M2 macrophages, CCL5 and IL-6. In high stromal ER\u03b1 expression samples, the expression levels of CD206 (M2 macrophage marker), CCL5 and IL6 were higher\u00a0than in samples with low stromal ER\u03b1 expression (Fig.\u00a06). These results are consistent with our in vitro and in vivo studies.DiscussionIn the TME, chronic inflammation has been proven to promote cancer progression. Tumor cells can secrete chemokines, cytokines and prostaglandins for inflammatory cells recruitment in order to sustain the inflammatory response. Nelson et al. indicated that inflammation plays an important role in the development and progression of PCa. The chronic inflammation mainly occurred in the area directly adjacent to\u00a0PCa lesions and induced inflammatory cell infiltration/accumulation. After immune cells accumulated at the sites, the tumor consequently increased prostate epithelial cells proliferation by inflammatory oxidants secretion. Furthermore, cancer related inflammation may affect tumor cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, etc. Not only epithelial cells, but also CAF\u00a0 can produce inflammatory factors and affect immune cells recruitment. Among several chemokines, CCL1, \u22122, \u22124, \u22125, \u22127, \u22128, \u221212, \u221213, and IL6 might influence the interaction of inflammation with cancer malignancy, and CCL2, \u22123, \u22125, \u22127, CXCL12, \u221214, and IL6 were found to be able to affect the macrophage infiltration. In our study, we found that expression of ER\u03b1 in CAF can reduce the number of infiltrated macrophages recruited by CAF and PCa cells and subsequently suppress cancer invasion.In the cancer initiation stage, epithelial cancer cells can activate and differentiate fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and the activated fibroblasts consequently promote tumor growth. When tumors progress, the ratio of cancer cells to CAFs may vary depending on the stages of the disease. A previous study showed that epithelial and CAF cells were set at different ratios to study the interaction between fibroblasts and different breast cancer cells. In a prostate cancer study, Camps et al. co-injected PC-3 cells with CAFs (PCa:CAF\u2009=\u200910:1; 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106:1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) into mice and successfully promoted tumor growth. In another of our studies, we co-injected CWR22Rv-1 cells and CAFs (22Rv-1:CAFs\u2009=\u20099:1; 9\u2009\u00d7\u2009105:1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) into each lobe of mouse anterior prostates and tested whether the ER\u03b1 status in CAFs could promote or inhibit tumor invasion. When we changed the PCa:CAF ratio from 9:1 to 5:1, we could also see the similar effects (data not shown). The data presented in this study was collected from PCa:CAF at ratio 9:1. In addition to determining the CAF.ER\u03b1-regulated PCa invasion, in another of our projects studying CAF ER\u03b1 role in PCa growth, we found the differential roles of CAF.ER\u03b1(+). CAF cells with higher ER\u03b1 expression could promote the growth, but inhibit the invasion of PC3, LNCaP, C4-2 and CWR22Rv-1\u00a0cells. The in vivo model also demonstrated mice co-injected with CWR22Rv-1 and CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells can develop bigger tumors yet lower metastasis rates as compared to mice co-injected with CWR22Rv-1 and CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells (Da and Yeh et al., paper in preparation).CAF have been demonstrated to play important roles in cancer progression through promoting tumor initiation, growth and invasion via promotion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and release of growth factors and cytokines. CAF are a source of ECM-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which might allow cancer cells to escape the primary tumor site. Our previous study also indicated CAF.ER\u03b1(+) suppressed PCa metastasis through decreased Thbs2 and MMP3 expression. Other studies demonstrated liver CAF could induce metastases through secreting inflammatory factors, like IL6 and MCP-1. In addition, CAF have the capability to recruit immune cells into the tumor region via altering the expression of IL6, CCL2, or NF-kB signals.Our findings indicated CAF cells expressing ER\u03b1 have a lower capability to recruit macrophages. Further mechanism dissection showed that both CCL5 and IL6 secretions are decreased in CAF.ER\u03b1(+), with CCL5 subsequently related to macrophage recruitment, but not IL6. We hypothesized that CCL5 may play a key role for recruiting the infiltrating macrophages to PCa cells. Robinson et al. also demonstrated that CCL5 plays an important role in attracting macrophage migration and may become a target for breast cancer therapy. In a breast cancer murine model, those murine cells treated with Met-CCL5 (receptor antagonist) had a decreased number of infiltrating macrophages associated with a significantly reduced tumor size. The development of \u201canti-macrophages\u201d may become one option for cancer therapy in the future. M2 type macrophages, one type of inflammatory cells that are differentiated by IL-4 and IL-13 stimulations, are known as major mediators linking cancer and inflammation. Recent data showed CAF, through stromal-derived growth factor-1 secretion, promote M2-type macrophages expression and PCa progression. We examined M2 macrophages related markers expression in macrophages after CAF CM treatment. Surprising, after co-culture with the CAF.ER\u03b1(+)CM, the macrophages expressed less M2 macrophage markers, including IL-10, Fuzz1 and Ym1, but not arginase-1 (Additional file 5: Figure S5A), suggesting CAF.ER\u03b1(+) may be able to suppress M2-type macrophages in the PCa TME. This conclusion is further supported by the finding of higher IL-4 and IL-13 expression in CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) than in CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells (Additional file 5: Figure S5B). This suggests CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells can release less IL-4 and IL-13 and may induce less M2-type macrophages than CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) cells.In prostate development, using Cre-loxP gene knockout strategy, reports have shown\u00a0that ER\u03b1\u00a0plays different roles in prostate epithelial as well as different types of prostate stromal cells. In the PCa mouse models, both ER\u03b1 knockout and ER\u03b1 agonist treatment showed mice with activated ER\u03b1 can develop high-grade PIN, suggesting ER\u03b1 might play important roles in PCa progression. Early studies indicated the expression of epithelial ER\u03b1, but not stromal ER\u03b1, was increased in PCa. Celhay et al. demonstrated stromal ER\u03b1 may also play an important role in recurrence of hormone refractory PCa. They compared ER\u03b1 expression by IHC in 55 paired patient PCa samples collected before androgen deprivation therapy and after hormonal relapse. They found a shorter time to hormonal relapse was associated with low staining for ER\u03b1 in stromal cells and correlated to shorter patient survival rate. Daniels et al. reported that ER\u03b1 positive rates reduced in the cancer associated stromal cells compared to the adjacent benign prostate tissue. Although the expression level of ER\u03b1 in cancer associated stromal cells is relatively weak, the intensity of ER\u03b1 expression in tumor-associated stroma shows a positive correlation with cancer progression. The reduced CAF ER\u03b1 IHC staining by Daniels et al. supports our finding that CAF ER\u03b1 plays a protective role in cancer invasion. Furthermore, PCa patients with CAF.ER\u03b1(+) expression have a better PSA free recurrence survival rate. Our data demonstrated stromal ER\u03b1 can inhibit PCa invasion through suppressing macrophage infiltration into tumor sites and directly decrease cytokine secretion in PCa cells.Platz et al. indicated chronic inflammation could be an epidemiologic factor for PCa, and De Marzo et al. also linked the PCa progression to inflammation related dietary factors. Prins et al. demonstrated that estrogen induced inflammation is specifically mediated by epithelial ER\u03b1. The epithelial inflammatory cell infiltrates were observed with aging in wild type and ER\u03b2 knock out (ER\u03b2KO), but not in ER\u03b1KO, mice after DES (Diethylstilbestrol) treatment. Van Laere et al. demonstrated that activation of NF-kB in inflammatory breast cancer was associated with loss of ER\u03b1 expression, suggesting ER\u03b1 might play a positive role in anti-inflammation. In autoimmune encephalomyelitis, ER\u03b1-ligands mediated anti-inflammation is important in neuroprotection for reducing the levels of central nervous system inflammation. ER\u03b1 has been proven to have an anti-inflammatory function in macrophages. However, the ER\u03b1 roles in inflammation-mediated PCa progression may depend on the ER\u03b1 location. Our data showed stromal ER\u03b1 can decrease macrophage infiltration, but may also suppress CAF-mediated inflammation\u00a0response.Our results showed ER\u03b1 in CAF not only decreases IL6 expression in CAF cells, but also regulates macrophages activity to decrease IL6 secretion, although the mechanisms by which CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells affect macrophage activity are still unclear. Previous studies indicated IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) secretion increases in tumor tissues can promote TAM generation. Deprivation of IL6 and LIF can suppress TAM induction. Early studies indicated that inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, might play major roles in the metastasis of breast and neck cancers. Michalaki et al. measured serum IL6 concentration from patients and found it is higher in patients with metastatic disease than localized disease. Lou et al. also determined IL6 plays an important role in the PCa metastatic Stat3 signaling transduction pathway. But, after CAF CM treatment, we found IL6 expression in PCa cells shows no significant\u00a0difference between CAF cells with/without ER\u03b1. Hsu et al. also found anti-IL6 might suppress the MMP2 and MMP9 expressions\u00a0in a colon cancer model. Importantly, Karin et al. demonstrated estrogen and propyl pyrazole triol (PPT, ER\u03b1 specific agonist) could suppress metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via inhibition of IL6 expression. They also indicated that the gender difference in tumor susceptibility resulted from a downregulation of IL6 production by macrophages in response to estrogens.ConclusionCAF.ER\u03b1(+) decreases prostate cancer invasion via diminishing tumor associated macrophage infiltration and IL6 secretion. Schematic diagram shows that CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells diminishes macrophage recruited toward to PCa via reducing CAF CCL5 secretion. These CAF.ER\u03b1(+) cells reduced invasion of PCa cells are at least partly due to reduced IL6 expression in the macrophages and CAFsCurrent concepts of PCa therapy mainly focus on applying anti-androgens/blocking AR activity. An increasing body of studies indicated targeting AR could suppress PCa growth but promote metastasis. Meanwhile, targeting sex hormones with various therapies may have dramatic effects, but also result in side effects. In this study, our results suggest that CAF ER\u03b1 could be applied as a prognostic marker to predict cancer progression, and targeting CCL5 and IL6 may be applied as an alternative therapeutic approach to reduce M2 type macrophage and PCa invasion in CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) PCa patients (Fig.\u00a07). Our study provides candidates, like CCL5 and macrophages, for cancer therapy. In the future, we can try to block the CCL5 signaling pathway to evaluate the possibility of CCL5 in PCa treatment.MethodsCell linesFour PCa cell lines, TRAMP-C1, CWR22Rv-1, C4-2, and PC-3, and the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). CAF were prepared as a primary culture from 36-weeks-old TRAMP mice and immortalized by SV40 large T-antigen using the detailed process described previously. All cells were maintained in RPMI media with 10\u00a0% FBS and 1\u00a0% penicillin/streptomycin.Isolation and primary culture of macrophages from B6 miceB6 mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. After sterilization, femur bones were isolated and sterilized in 70\u00a0% ethanol and rinsed with PBS. We cut the bones at both ends, flushed the bone-marrow out with RPMI media with 10\u00a0% heat-inactivated FBS using syringes with 25-gauge needles. Bone marrow fluid was centrifuged at 1200 x rpm for 10 mins, and cells were cultured with RPMI media with macrophages colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF 20\u00a0ng/ml). After 6\u00a0days of culture, primary macrophages became mature for experimentation.Lentiviral ER\u03b1 transduction of CAF cells and firefly luciferase transduction of CWR22Rv-1 cellsThe ER\u03b1 cDNA was cloned into PmeI site of pWPI lentiviral vector. The 293\u00a0T packaging cells were transiently transfected with pMD2.G and psPAX2 with pWPI-vector or pWPI-ER\u03b1, to produce lentiviral particles. The supernatants containing lentiviral particles were collected 48\u00a0h post-transfection of 293\u00a0T cells, and polybrene was added. The lentiviral supernatants were then filtered and used to transduce CAF for 48\u00a0h. The viral vector or ER\u03b1 transduced CAF were then subjected to 5\u00a0mg/L blasticidin selection. To monitor tumor progression by In vivo Imaging System (IVIS) system, CWR22Rv-1 cells were tagged with firefly luciferase by lentivirus system.Migration assayCAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) were cultured in 24-well plates. After 24\u00a0h, macrophages were seeded on the inserted transwells. After 24\u00a0h co-incubation, transwells were washed with PBS and then fixed by 75\u00a0% ethanol. Next, transwell membranes were stained with 1\u00a0% toluidine blue (w/v, prepared in PBS) and non-migrated macrophages, remaining on the inner transwell surface, were wiped off. Macrophages that migrated to the bottom side of membranes were counted in ten representative areas via microscope (x100 fold).Invasion assayConditioned media (CM) collected from the CAF/macrophages co-culture system were used to attract PCa cells invasion via matrigel coated (0.2\u00a0mg/ml, 100\u00a0\u03bcl, air dried overnight) transwells. For the co-culture system, CAF.ER\u03b1(+) or CAF.ER\u03b1(\u2212) were seeded in the bottom wells of 6-well plates and macrophages were added into the top transwells (pore size is 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm). The CM was collected from bottom wells after 48\u00a0h co-culture. Then, CM was added into each well of new 24-well plates, then matrigel coated transwells were inserted and PCa cells (TRAMP-C1, CWR22Rv1, C4-2, or PC-3, as in figures) at 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104/150\u00a0\u03bcl were seeded on each transwell. After 24\u00a0h incubation, transwells were washed, fixed, and stained. The method for counting invaded cell numbers was the same as with migration assay.Immunohistochemistry (IHC)IHC staining was carried out as described previously. Sections were incubated with the primary antibodies, anti-F4/80 (anti-mouse macrophages, Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-CD206 (anti-M2 macrophage; sc-20150, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), anti-CCL5 (Ameritech Biomedicines, Houston, TX), anti-IL6 (Abcam, ab6672, Cambridge, MA) and anti-firefly (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), in 3\u00a0% BSA in PBS overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C followed by respective secondary antibodies.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR analysisSequence of qPCR primersName\t\tSequence, 5\u2032\u2009\u2192\u20093\u2032\t \tCcl2\tsense\tTAA AAA CCT GGA TCG GAA CCA AA\t \t\tantisense\tGCA TTA GCT TCA GAT TTA CGG GT\t \tCcl5\tsense\tTAT CCT GGT GGA GTT GTG\t \t\tantisense\tCAG AGT CAT CCC TGC TTC\t \tCxcl-12\tsense\tTGC ATC AGT GAC GGT AAA CCA\t \t\tantisense\tCAC AGT TTG GAG TGT TGAG GAT\t \tIL6\tsense\tCTG CAA GAG ACT TCC ATC CAG\t \t\tantisense\tAGT GGT ATA GAC AGG TCT GTT GG\t \tMMP1\tsense\tCCC TGG GAA GCT GTT ATC TTC AA\t \t\tantisense\tCGA CCC ACT TCT GAT GGG CT\t \tMMP2\tsense\tACC TGA ACA CTT TCT ATG GCT G\t \t\tantisense\tCTT CCG CAT GGT CTC GAT G\t \tMMP9\tsense\tGGA CCC GAA GCG GAC ATT G\t \t\tantisense\tCGT CGT CGA AAT GGG CAT CT\t \tMMP13\tsense\tTGT TTG CAG AGC ACT ACT TGA A\t \t\tantisense\tCAG TCA CCT CTAAGCC AAA GAA A\t \tFizz1\tsense\tCCA ATC CAG CTA ACT ATC CCT CC\t \t\tantisense\tACC CAG TAG CAG TCA TCC CA\t \tArginase 1\tsense\tTGT CCC TAA TGA CAG CTC CTT\t \t\tantisense\tGCA TCC ACC CAA ATG ACA CAT\t \tYm1\tsense\tCAG GTC TGG CAA TTC TTC TGA A\t \t\tantisense\tGTC TTG CTC ATG TGT GTA AGT GA\t \tIL4\tsense\tATC ATC GGC ATT TTG AAC GAG G\t \t\tantisense\tTGC AGC TCC ATG AGA ACA CTA\t \tIL13\tsense\tTGA GCA ACA TCA CAC AAG ACC\t \t\tantisense\tGGC CTT GCG GTT ACA GAG G\t \tGAPDH\tsense\tAAT GTC ACC GTT GTC CAG TTG\t \t\tantisense\tGTG GCT GGG GCT CTA CTT C\t \tTotal RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNAs (1\u00a0\u03bcg) were subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript III transcriptase (Invitrogen). The obtained cDNAs were applied for qPCR using a SYBR green Bio-Rad CFX96 system. Primers used are listed in Table\u00a01. Gene mRNA expression levels were normalized to the mRNA level of GAPDH.CCL5 promoter luciferase assayCCL5 promoter luciferase activity was performed using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen). CAF cells were transfected with CCL5-Luc (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg) and 1\u00a0ng pRL-TK-Luc reporter gene. After transfection, the media were refreshed to 10\u00a0% charcoal/dextran stripped (CD)-FBS media for 24\u00a0h and 10 nM E2 was added as indicated for an additional 24\u00a0h. Cells were then harvested for the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI).ELISACM was collected from CAF only or CAF co-cultured with macrophages for ELISA analyses of CCL5 and IL6 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Orthotopic implantationFor the orthotopic implantation in mice, CWR22Rv-1 cells were transduced with firefly cDNA (22Rv1-Luc). CAF were mixed with 22Rv1-Luc cells (1:9 ratio) and injected into anterior prostate of 8\u00a0weeks old athymic nude mice. For cells injection, 22Rv1-Luc/CAF cells (9:1 ratio, total 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were suspended in 20\u00a0\u03bcl of media and Matrigel mix (1:1, v:v). Seven animals were used per group. Mice were monitored by IVIS every 2\u00a0weeks for tracking tumor growth and metastasis by intraperitoneal injection of luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) to allow the luciferase to fluoresce. Tumors from primary and metastatic sites were collected after a final IVIS imaging at 12\u00a0weeks after implantation. Tumor sizes and macrophages infiltration were compared after IHC staining by macrophage markers. Lymph nodes were stained with firefly luciferase antibody (Santa Cruz, c-12) to confirm cancer cells metastasized from the primary tumor sites. All mice experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Rochester Medical Center.Statistical analysisValues were expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (S.D.). The Student\u2019s t test was used to calculate two-sided P values, and considered statistically significant when P\u2009<\u20090.05.Additional filesAbbreviationsCAFcancer associated fibroblastsM\u03c6macrophagesTAMtumor associated macrophagesEMTepithelial to mesenchymal transitionTMEtumor microenvironmentCompeting interestsThe authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.Authors\u2019 contributionsCR Yeh and SY Yeh developed the original hypothesis, experimental design and draft of manuscript.

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

The triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is responsible for 10 to 20% of all diagnosed breast cancers, as no specific targeted therapy exists. TNBC is characterized by larger tumors and higher grades, with a high metastasis rate and shorter recurrence period. Due to the lack of known receptors and the fact that current in vivo models for this type of tumor may not correctly mimic human breast cancer, the search for alternatives has intensified. The 4T1 mammary adenocarcinoma murine cell line has presented itself as a good model system as it closely resembles human TNBC. 4T1 also has the advantage of being able to be translated in orthotropic positions and in immune competent recipients for a more reliable biological system that can correctly mimic the response to targeting and therapeutics.The current treatment options for TNBC include surgery, radiotherapy and classical chemotherapy, but further potential therapeutics for TNBC have been reported and are reviewed elsewhere. Regarding targeted drug delivery for breast cancer, studies have largely centered on pre-clinical studies using anti-HER2 antibody-linked liposomal drugs. However, few reports have studied the use of peptides for targeted drug delivery in breast cancer treatment, especially in TNBC. Previous studies were able to successfully identify a peptide that specifically binds, both in vitro and in vivo, brain metastasis derived from the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line. Additionally, the peptide AP8, identified using a Ph.D.-7\u2122 Phage Display Peptide Library, showed high homology and affinity to the \u03b1FGF receptor FGFR1, with subsequent biological activity in both breast cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells. To date, only two successful studies showed the use of pH sensitive low insertion peptides (pHLIPs) and a 12-mer secreted clusterin (sCLU) binding peptide for the 4T1 cell line, thus confirming the beneficial use of peptides for the delivery of therapeutic cargoes to advanced staged triple negative breast tumors. Given this, there is an unmet need to develop novel approaches to specifically target these cells.The search for novel anticancer therapies has emerged and the use of peptides that target cancer cells has been a widely studied strategy to improve classical chemotherapy and enhance drug delivery systems. Peptides have become an attractive alternative, as they are easily synthesized and modified to improve stability, solubility and tissue penetration.Phage display has been highly successful in generating peptide ligands against a large variety of novel targets concerning solid tumors and the tumor niche, both in vitro and in vivo, unraveling the overall strength of this methodology to personalize targeted cancer treatment.In this study, we describe the identification of two novel peptide ligands homing the 4T1 cell line. The identified peptides were characterized and their binding specificity towards the 4T1 cell line was confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Screening and analysis of possible targets is discussed, taking into account their future use as a new targeting system for TNBC treatment.Materials & MethodsCell culture, media and buffersMammary adenocarcinoma murine 4T1 cell line (kindly provided by Dr. Jo\u00e3o Nuno Moreira, from Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology (CNC) (University of Coimbra, Portugal)) were grown in RPMI 1640, while murine fibroblast 3T3 (kindly provided by Dr. Miguel Gama from Centre of Biological Engineering (CEB) (University of Minho, Portugal)) and MDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) cells were grown in DMEM (Merck Millipore). Both media were supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Merck Millipore) and 10% FBS (Merck Millipore). All cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Sub-culturing was performed at a cell confluence of approximately 80%. Adherent cells were washed with PBS 1X pH 7.4 [137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 2 mM KH2PO4] solution and detached with trypsin-EDTA (Merck Millipore) before sub-culturing. All chemical reagents used were of analytical grade.In vitro phage biopanningPeptides were selected from two commercially available random amino acid libraries from New England Biolabs (NEB), displayed on the minor coat protein III (pIII) of the M13 phage via N-terminal fusion, namely the 7-mer flanked by a pair of cysteine residues (The Ph.D.\u2122-C7C Phage Display Peptide Library) and the 12-mer (The Ph.D.\u2122-12 Phage Display Peptide Library), using a modified biopanning protocol, the Biopanning and Rapid Analysis of Selective Interactive Ligands (BRASIL) method. Briefly, approximately 1\u00d7106 cells/mL were collected, centrifuged at 250 x g for 10 min and the pellet suspended in 1 mL of complete DMEM medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). The cell suspension was centrifuged with the same conditions and the blocking procedure was repeated 3 times. Afterwards, cells were suspended in complete DMEM medium containing 3% of BSA and kept on ice. Ten \u03bcL of the original library [C7C: 1\u00d71013 plaque-forming units (PFUs) or 12-mer: 2\u00d71013 PFUs] was added to the previous cell suspension and incubated on ice for 4 h.An organic phase solution was prepared, consisting of cyclohexane:dibutyl phthalate (1:9 (v/v), FisherScientific) and about 7 mL of this solution was added to previously prepared BRASIL tubes. A 300 \u03bcL PBS droplet was formed after adding this buffer to the lower non-miscible organic phase. About 200 \u03bcL of cell suspension containing the binding library was gently inserted in the aqueous PBS droplet and the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. After centrifuging, the pellet containing the eluted phages was recovered and resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of Tris-HCl (10 mM pH 9.5, Sigma). In the case of eluted phages amplified between rounds with the 12-mer library, the amplification was performed by infecting an improved E. coli+ strain JM109. This strain contains a plasmid that compensates for low abundance of certain tRNAs, reducing amplification bias and enriching in binding sequences. After amplification, the eluted phages are purified and concentrated with 20% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (PEG, Applichem) 8000/2.5 M NaCl solution. Phage titer was determined was determined using the double layer agar technique in LB agar plates [25 g/L Luria Bertani broth (Nzytech) with 20 g/L agar (Frilabo)], containing 0.25 mM IPTG (Nzytech) and 0.05 g/L X-gal (Nzytech). The number of transducing units was calculated by counting the blue plaques on the plates after 12 h at 37\u00b0C.Both the eluted phages not amplified (from the C7C library) and those amplified between rounds (from the 12-mer library) were used for additional rounds of biopanning. A total of four selection rounds, plus a counter-selection round (CSR) with 3T3 cells, were performed. The CSR differs from the selection rounds, as the collected fraction is the aqueous phase containing the non-binding phages and not the pellet containing the eluted phages.Preparation of individual clones for peptide analysisssDNA was prepared according to a standard protocol, using iodide buffer [10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 1 mM EDTA and 4 M NaI pH 8.0 (Riedel-de Haen)], followed by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 30 \u03bcL of Tris-EDTA buffer [TE buffer 1X: 0.1 M Tris-base pH 8.0 and 10 mM EDTA] and the product was quantified using Nanodrop 1000 (ThermoScientific).PCR, DNA sequencing and insert analysisIndividual phages were isolated and their DNA was extracted and prepared for sequencing, to ascertain the displayed foreign peptide of each phage. The insert size of each clone was analyzed by PCR using the forward primer 5\u2019- TTAACTCCCTGCAAGCCTCA-3\u2019 and the reverse primer 5- CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG -3. PCR reactions were carried out in a 20 \u03bcL reaction volume containing 2 \u03bcL of phage DNA, 10 mM KAPA dNTP mix (KapaBiosystems), 1U/\u03bcL Kapa Taq polymerase (KapaBiosystems) and 10 \u03bcM of each primer. The PCR reaction was performed in a MyCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the following conditions: 25 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s; annealing in the temperatures range from 45 to 70\u00b0C, for 30 s; and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. The product size was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE 1X buffer (Tris-acetate EDTA Buffer) at 70 volts for 50 min. A NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used to remove residual PCR components from the above DNA products for sequencing analysis. DNA sequencing was carried out by Macrogen Inc. service, using the M13-pIII sequencing primer 5\u2019- TTAACTCCCTGCAAGCCTCA-3\u2019, provided with the library kits. Vector NTI software (Vector NTI Advance, version 11.5, Invitrogen) was used for the analysis of correct insertions of the selected peptides taking into account that the displayed peptides are expressed at the N-terminus of pIII, followed by a short spacer (G-G-G-S) and the wild-type pIII sequence.Bacteriophage labellingAround 1\u00d71010 PFUs/mL of phage:peptide 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2 were precipitated with PEG/NaCl solution and resuspended in 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 8.5 (Sigma). About 1 mg of Alexa Fluor 488 tetrafluorophenyl ester (Life Technologies) was dissolved in 0.1 mL of anhydrous DMSO (Sigma) and stored in 10 \u03bcL aliquots. One aliquot was added to each of the phage preparations and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. Following the reaction, bacteriophage particles were added to a sanitized Microsep Advance Centrifuge Device 10 K MWCO (Pall Corporation) and were centrifuged at 7,500 x g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. This procedure allowed the purification of labeled conjugated and non-conjugated phages, as free Alexa 488 will pass through the membrane to the filtrate receiver. The upper solution was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS.Flow cytometry analysisTo characterize the selected peptides specificity and selectivity, phage:peptide 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2 previously conjugated with Alexa 488 were analyzed using flow cytometry to evaluate their binding towards 4T1, 3T3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Briefly, 1\u00d7105 cells were harvested, washed in PBS and blocked using PBS solution supplemented with 3% of BSA at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS with Tween 20 1X [PBST 1X: PBS and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Applichem)] and incubated with 100 \u03bcL of fluorescent phage particles. The cells were rinsed again with PBST and finally resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of PBS for flow cytometry analysis using an EC800\u2122 flow cytometer analyzer (Sony Biotechnology). A total of 20000 events were accounted.Immunofluorescence microscopy4T1 and 231 mammary cancer tissue sections embedded in paraffin were deparaffinized and rehydrated as described in. To maximize antibody binding, antigen retrieval was performed by heating slides in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Sigma) at 95\u00b0C for 20 min and slow cooling at room temperature for about 20 min.Tissue samples were blocked using a 5% BSA solution added directly onto the specimen and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Immunostaining was performed as previously described by adding 100 \u03bcL of 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2 (1x1010 PFUs/mL) to the tissue for subsequent incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C. As a control, a slide with phage wild-type particles was used. Next, slides were washed 4X with Tris Buffered Saline with Tween 20 1X [TBST 1X: TBS and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20] for 5 min and 100 \u03bcL of primary rabbit anti-fd bacteriophage antibody (Sigma) (working dilution of 1:5000 in BSA 1%) was added to all slides and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The coverslips were rinsed again 4X with TBST 1X and incubated with the FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) (working dilution of 1:40 in BSA 1%) at room temperature for 2 h. After the additional washing steps with TBST 1X, the slides were stained with Vectashield\u00ae mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The tissue slides were allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Images were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope incorporated with a high-sensitivity camera Olympus DP71 with 40X and 60X magnifications.Peptide analysis and homologyIn order to accurately eliminate the existence of target unrelated peptides, false positives and already existing mimotopes, the identified sequences were scanned using the SAROTUP webserver software and they were screened using the MimoDB database. Since the currently existing sequence alignment tools are developed for long protein sequences, therefore not suitable when analyzing short peptides, the sequences were further analyzed by the BLAST algorithm for homology to proteins with known or putative cancer correlations. The query was performed using the BLAST search program (BLASTP 2.2.31+) against the Homo sapiens and Mus musculus non-redundant protein database using Blastp (BLASTp with word size of 3 and Blosum62 matrix, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).Statistical analysisData was expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows) to identify differences among multiple groups, considering a significance level of 95%.ResultsIn vitro biopanning and selection of novel peptides for 4T1 cellsTwo independent phage display experiments were performed using the BRASIL methodology. The first experiment was conducted using the C7C library starting with a CSR against the negative control 3T3 cell line, to eliminate non-specific peptides and maximize binding efficiency, followed by a total of four selection rounds against 4T1 cells. We choose not to amplify the phage particles obtained in each round because this amplification has been shown to decrease the libraries diversity by enriching the pool with clones that have a growth advantage. Since the phage pools between rounds were not amplified, the output of one round was the input of the next round and we could observe a phage concentration decrease from round 1 to round 4 (Fig 1A).Enrichment of binding phages and phage recovery after in vitro biopanning rounds against the 4T1 cell line using C7C and 12-mer libraries.(A) Enrichment of binding phages for each biopanning round. The phage titer was assessed between rounds and compared between the two modified panning procedures. (B) Phage recovery yield of internalized phages after consecutive selection step. The phage recovery of both libraries was calculated by dividing the number of recovered plaque-forming phages (output) by the input number of plaque-forming phages.The second experiment was performed using the 12-mer library, also for a total of four selection rounds using the 4T1 cell line but in this case, the CSR with the 3T3 cells was performed after the selection rounds. Given the loss of phage populations observed during the successive biopanning rounds with the C7C library (Fig 1A), in these experiments with the 12-mer library, amplification between each round was conducted. The number of recovered phages after amplification is higher, leading to a high quantity of phages added to each biopanning round, hence to a higher input titer (Fig 1A). After titering, the phage binding efficiency of both libraries was calculated by dividing the number of recovered plaque-forming phages (output) by the input number of plaque-forming phages (phage recovering). Due to the absence of phage pool amplification between rounds in the experiments conducted with the C7C library, we can observe a very low phage recovery rate and even a decrease from round 2 to round 3 (Fig 1B). Nevertheless, for the 12-mer library, a 10-fold higher enrichment was observed from round 1 to round 2, followed by a subsequent plateau phase after round 3.These results clearly show an enhanced enrichment of cell-binding phages (increase in binding efficiency) for the 4T1 cells. The enrichment varied between the libraries and a strong enrichment did not necessarily correlate with the selection of a single cell-specific phage.PCR amplification and DNA sequencing analysisAfter four selection rounds, individual clones were characterized by DNA sequencing. For the C7C library, a total of 22 random clones from rounds 2, 3 and 4 were individually amplified in E. coli. The DNA of each clone was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the fragment containing the peptide insert was amplified by PCR. The products were analyzed by DNA agarose electrophoresis and all the clones showed a positive 329 bp-sized band (data not shown). Sequencing was performed for rounds 2, 3, and 4. The results showed five different peptide hits (Fig 2), with enrichment of the peptide CPTASNTSC over subsequent rounds. This peptide showed 50% frequency at round 2 with a 1.8 fold-enrichment at round 3. This continuous increasing proportion over other peptide hits was maintained, until 100% frequency was achieved in round 4. This data indicates that a novel peptide (4T1pep1 \u2013CPTASNTSC) was selectively identified for 4T1 cells.List of the most enriched phage peptides for the C7C library ranked based on their relative proportion to all PFUs collected phages after the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rounds.In the experiments conducted with the 12-mer library, sequencing was only performed for the last round (CSR) due to cost and time related factors, masking the analysis of different peptide hits and subsequent enrichment over rounds, as previously shown. Nonetheless, further studies were carried on, which validated the peptide selected from this library regarding its capacity to specifically bind the 4T1 cell line. In this case, a total of 12 random clones from the CSR were individually amplified in E. coli. Again, the DNA of each clone was isolated and the fragment containing the peptide insert selected from previous biopanning round was amplified by PCR. The products were analyzed by DNA agarose electrophoresis showing a positive 335 bp-sized band (data not shown). The sequencing results revealed the presence of a new 12 amino acid sequence peptide (4T1pep2\u2014EVQSSKFPAHVS), which resulted from 100% homology between the clones obtained from the CSR round.Validation of peptide bindingTo confirm the binding ability of the selected peptides to 4T1 receptors, an immunofluorescence assay was performed, using a specific antibody against M13 filamentous phage. Phage particles displaying the selected peptides 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2 were applied to 4T1 tissue sections and wild-type M13 phage was used as negative control. Additionally, 231 tissue sections were used as a human TNBC model to evaluate the possible existence of peptide species cross-reactivity and to support the translational purposes of this study (Fig 3).Immunofluorescence staining of 4T1 (A-C) and MDA-MB-231 (D-E) tissues with 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2. (A1-A3) 4T1 tissue section incubated with wild-type M13 phage (negative control). (B1-B3) 4T1 tissue section incubated with M13 phage displaying 4T1pep1, stained with DAPI (B1) and FITC (B2). (C1-C3) 4T1 tissue section incubated with M13 phage displaying 4T1pep2, stained with DAPI (C1) and FITC (C2). (D1-D3) MDA-MB-231 tissue section incubated with wild-type M13 phage (negative control). (E1-E3) MDA-MB-231 tissue section incubated with M13 phage displaying 4T1pep1, stained with DAPI (E1) and FITC (E2). (F1-F3) MDA-MB-231 tissue section incubated with M13 phage displaying 4T1pep2, stained with DAPI (F1) and FITC (F2).The results showed no significant fluorescence for the negative control with both tissue sections and a bright green signal in the tissues incubated with the peptides, thus confirming that only phages displaying the selected peptides bound specifically to the tissue. Both peptides identified by phage display using different libraries were able to bind efficiently to 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 tissue sections (n = 2). The presence of fluorescent phage particles on the sample, after several washing steps, validates the specificity and binding capacity of the peptides selected by the BRASIL method.Moreover, the high selectivity of 4T1 cell line targeting peptides was confirmed by flow cytometry. About 69% of the overall cell population was bound to the 4T1pep1 (p < 0.0001) and around 51% to the 4T1pep2, representing 18% decreased affinity for the 4T1pep2 as compared to the 4T1pep1 (Fig 4). This may be due to the additional amplification step performed for the second biopanning experiment. Furthermore, no positive binding was found when the peptides were incubated with the control 3T3 cells, confirming their great specificity. The 4T1pep1 exhibited an extremely higher binding capacity (p < 0.0001) for the 4T1 cells as compared to the control (3T3 cells). Interestingly, a high affinity was also found for the human cell line MDA-MB-231 (p < 0.0001) and similar trends in the binding capacity were observed for both peptides. In summary, both peptides showed successful binding to both TNBC cell lines, therefore confirming not only their selectivity but also possible cross-reactivity amongst species.Flow cytometry results expressing the percentage of binding of the peptides 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2 to 4T1, 3T3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.All data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments.

N.S. indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05).Bioinformatics analysis: search for candidate targetsTo determine possible existence of off-target sequences, due to non-specific binding, we analyzed our sequences using SAROTUP. No previous hit sequences similar to the peptides identified in this work were achieved, highlighting the novelty of the identified sequences (Table 1).Validation of the selected peptides through the analysis of existing target-unrelated peptides, false positives and/or mimotopes.SAROTUP freely available at http://immunet.cn/sarotup/index.html was the software used.Analysis/Purpose\tResults\t \tTUPscan to screen for target-unrelated peptides\tNo motif encountered\t \tMimodb to screen for published mimotopes of other groups with various target peptide\tNo hits found, indicating that the peptide is target specific\t \tMimoblast to check mimotope database for peptide identity\tE-value* too high, indicating non-reliable similarity to existing peptides\t \t* Lowest-energy weighed score.After four rounds of in vitro phage display selection, the peptide sub-population shows a collection of murine breast tumor-avid phage clones. Translated DNA sequences were analyzed by the BLAST algorithm and the identification of possible cancer-related targets by ligand homology was queried. Homology of selected peptides to known proteins can sometimes be informative in identifying either ligands or possible candidates for the native cell binding ligand. Short peptide homologies to intracellular, membrane and extracellular proteins can be found, however relevancy in their cellular location and biological activity must be taken into account. For each peptide sequence, top matching proteins were evaluated for percent homology, E-value presented and for their possible existence as membrane-bound proteins. Two interesting targets related to putative cancer proteins were obtained and are shown in Table 2. All proteins showed an overall identity above 60% and maximum scores superior to 15 bits with 0 gaps. The match returned variable E-values, but only those inferior to 10 were considered, in order to minimize the random matches in the entire protein database. Therefore, it is common that the identified peptide has little sequence similarity with its template, though they do have similar physicochemical properties and spatial organization locally.Genbank search results using NCBI protein\u2013protein blast BLASTP 2.1.3 for the selected peptide sequences.Peptides were analyzed against Homo sapiens and Mus musculus non-redundant protein database using BLASTP for cancer related proteins (PSI-BLAST, word size of 3, Blosum62 matrix and E<10), to identify proteins with homologous motifs.

The 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cell line has been shown to be an accurate xenograft model for stage IV of human breast cancer. Targeting approaches based on overexpression of specific molecules are often varied by cancer cell heterogeneity, which can lead to poor drug response. Although phage display has been applied for targeting breast cancer, the recognition of specific cell receptors for phage particle cloning and active targeting to the TNBC subtype are still scarce. Moreover, only one study has been reported regarding 4T1 targeting, supporting the need to find alternative targeting systems for this aggressive cancer subtype.We report the selection of two novel peptides by phage display (using two different libraries), which revealed high binding efficiency and selectivity towards the 4T1 cell line. The selection from phage display libraries is driven by two main steps, (1) the screening step that enriches for clones binding to the desired target or any other physical moieties present; and (2) the amplification step, which consists on the infection of bacteria and secretion of enriched phage clones that have an advantage during any amplification step. In the first biopanning experiment using the C7C library, clones were sequenced between rounds and the retrieved peptide hits were analyzed. Although five different peptides were identified, a 100% enrichment of the 4T1pep1 (CPTASNTSC) was observed, thus this peptide was selected for further studies.In the second biopanning experiment using the 12-mer library, phage amplification between rounds was performed due to the loss of phage titer in the previous biopanning protocol, individual clones from the last round were selected for DNA sequencing and the peptide sequences were retrieved. Pair-wise multiple alignments also showed a 100% similarity between all clones from the last round that were randomly selected, amplified and sequenced. However, it is common to obtain homology between DNA of clones from the same round. Indeed, variability may only be noted when 30 or more clones are sequenced or when clones from earlier rounds are also analyzed. Nonetheless, it is important to reinforce that both peptides were accurately selected in two different and independent biopanning experiments, yielding the same frequency in the last biopanning rounds, hence confirming that they are interesting hits as novel peptides for the 4T1 cell line and that amplification between rounds may somewhat reduce binding efficiency, but not selectivity.Moreover, although biased sequences were minimized using a specific E. coli+ strain JM109, it is important to discard the possibility of non-specific targets, related to the materials used during the biopanning process, as well as to identify potential false positives. For this purpose, web-based tools, such as PepBank and SAROTUP, can be used to search for peptides that have been reported, or for peptides that bind unintended materials, respectively. A preliminary analysis with PepBank showed no relevant data concerning similarity between the identified peptides and otherwise published peptides, which imposed a focused analysis and, on the other hand, supported the novelty of this study.To further validate the binding ability of the selected sequences, proving our hypothesis, an immunofluorescence assay was performed. The results showed a positive binding of the selected peptides to the 4T1 cell line and, interestingly, to the human MDA-MB-231 cells. These results were also corroborated by a flow cytometry analysis, which clearly showed that there was no affinity to the control murine 3T3 cell line and that both 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2 selectively bound the 4T1 cells. A significant binding capacity to the human MDA-MB-231 cell line was observed, which was expected, as many peptides for murine cell lines show highly conserved moieties or domains that closely resemble the corresponding human isoform and species cross-reactivity between selected peptides using phage display has been reported before. Also, the 4T1pep1 showed a somewhat higher binding capacity as compared to the 4T1pep2, concerning both the murine and human cell lines. This finding was not surprising as peptides with cysteine terminal residues have generally demonstrated higher affinity to target cells than the linear peptides.Small peptides identified by biopanning have the unique characteristic of binding to sites involved in many important functional interactions. These peptides are often capable of interfering with protein\u2013protein interactions, as they share sufficient homology between the peptide and the ligand, allowing for target identification by a narrowed, but accurate receptor\u2019 ligand sequence homology search. Based on this, a multiple sequence alignment for a narrowed search of cancer-related or cancer putative proteins was performed for both peptides, leading to the identification of interesting targets. The narrowed search greatly reduced the number of artificial hits that would be generated randomly in the absence of an accurate search query. Hits were selected considering the use of whole cells in the biopanning experiments, enabling the identification of cell surface molecules that could be further used as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets.Sequence homology was found amongst two main significant proteins for both murine and human using the peptides 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2. Regarding the first peptide, no similarity was found when retrieved against murine protein targets (E-values > 10). This fact may be due to the reduced peptide size (9 amino acids). For the same sequence, a human protein target Mucin-16 (or CA125) was found with 60% homology achieved with several matches considering the amino acid sequence PTSSNSVVTS. For the 4T1pep2, the best E-value was obtained for a murine or human WD repeat membrane protein family, which also showed 71% identity. Although it has been implied in the regulation of several cellular functions, signaling pathways and cell differentiation, the large size of this specific family makes it difficult to analyze a specific protein target for such a short peptide sequence. Nonetheless, it was compelling to observe that homology to the Mucin-16 was also found for this peptide. An overall identity of 83% and up to 6 amino acids overlap was obtained for the several matches that were shown throughout the N-terminus extracellular region of the protein, namely concerning the amino acid sequences QSSKFP and EVQSS.Mucin-16 is a well characterized biomarker and its deregulation has been previously linked to cancer and inflammation, showing overexpression in breast, prostate, lung and pancreas cancer. The N-terminus of Mucin-16 comprises a heavily O-glycosylated, non-tandem repeat domain of ~12\u2009000 amino acids. These tandem repeat structures contain a high proportion of proline, threonine and serine (which constitute the PTS domain). These physicochemical properties are also shown for the selected peptides, which could have contributed to such homology. This hypothesis can be supported by the immunofluorescence and flow cytometry data, which show a similar trend in selectivity for both peptides. Mucin-16 has already been explored for breast cancer therapy, which makes it a promising target for the novel 4T1 peptide identified in this work. Future analysis underlying docking and binding experiments for this protein could be interesting to prove its role as a targeting receptor using these novel peptides.Novel peptides and motifs identified by phage display are promising for application towards therapeutic moieties. Additionally, previous studies have shown that specific targeting of tumors not only diminishes side effects, but potentiates overall activity of classical chemotherapy agents and promotes translational medicine, potentially revolutionizing cancer therapy as it exists.ConclusionsIn this study, we successfully identified two novel peptides - 4T1pep1 and 4T1pep2\u2014through in vitro phage display biopanning against a specific TNBC murine cell line. To our knowledge, only one study reported a peptide targeting this specific cell line. The results showed a high enrichment of the selected peptides over various biopanning rounds and selective binding to both 4T1 mammary murine tissues and human MDA-MB-231 cell line. Altogether, this provides evidence that the peptides may have a translational application towards both human and murine targeting ligands. Moreover, through a homology search query, a promising mucin type isoform (Mucin-16) hit protein, which is involved in breast cancer progression, has been identified. Overall, the 4T1 peptides herein selected may serve as novel ligands that can potentially be explored for nano-based targeted delivery for TNBC therapy.ReferencesCancer incidence and mortality worldwide: sources, methods and major patterns in GLOBOCAN 2012A review of triple-negative breast cancerTriple Negative Breast Cancer: Nanosolutions for a Big ChallengeA mouse model for triple-negative breast cancer tumor-initiating cells (TNBC-TICs) exhibits similar aggressive phenotype to the human diseaseIdentification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapiesMouse models of advanced spontaneous metastasis for experimental therapeuticsMouse models of breast cancer metastasisTriple-negative breast cancer\u2014current status and future directionsThe latest progress in research on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC): risk factors, possible therapeutic targets and prognostic markersTargeted drug delivery systems mediated by a novel Peptide in breast cancer therapy and imagingIdentification and characterization of a novel phage display-derived peptide with affinity for human brain metastatic breast cancerIdentification of a novel aFGF-binding peptide with anti-tumor effect on breast cancer from phage display libraryTargeting Breast Tumors with pH (Low) Insertion PeptidesMolecular imaging of breast tumors using a near-infrared fluorescently labeled clusterin binding peptideCombinatorial peptide libraries: mining for cell-binding peptidesFrom phage display to nanoparticle delivery: functionalizing liposomes with multivalent peptides improves targeting to a cancer biomarkerBacteriophages and cancerSelection of tumor-binding ligands in cancer patients with phage display librariesUsing phage as a platform to select cancer cell-targeting peptidesPhage protein-targeted cancer nanomedicinesBiopanning and rapid analysis of selective interactive ligandsIntroduction of plasmid encoding for rare tRNAs reduces amplification bias in phage display biopanningNEB.

        "content": "Fibroblasts are among the most abundant stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), progressively differentiating into activated, motile, myofibroblast-like, protumorigenic cells referred to as Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). To investigate the mechanisms by which epithelial cells direct this transition, the early stages of tumorigenesis were exemplified by indirect cocultures of WI-38 or human primary breast cancer fibroblasts with human mammary epithelial cells expressing an inducible c-Myc oncogene (MCF10A-MycER). After c-Myc activation, the conditioned medium (CM) of MCF10A-MycER cells significantly enhanced fibroblast activation and mobilization. As this was accompanied by decreased insulin-like growth factor binding protein-6 (IGFBP-6) and increased insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGF-II (IGF-I, IGF-II) in the CM, IGFs were investigated as key chemotactic factors. Silencing IGFBP-6 or IGF-I or IGF-II expression in epithelial cells or blocking Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) activity on fibroblasts significantly altered fibroblast mobilization. Exposure of WI-38 fibroblasts to CM from induced MCF10A-MycER cells or to IGF-II upregulated FAK phosphorylation on Tyr<sup397</sup , as well as the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), features associated with CAF phenotype and increased cell migratory/invasive behavior. In three-dimensional (3D)-organotypic assays, WI-38 or human primary fibroblasts, preactivated with either CM from MCF10A-MycER cells or IGFs, resulted in a permissive TME that enabled nontransformed MCF10A matrix invasion. This effect was abolished by inhibiting IGF-1R activity. Thus, breast epithelial cell oncogenic activation and stromal fibroblast transition to CAFs are linked through the IGFs/IGF-1R axis, which directly promotes TME remodeling and increases tumor invasion.",

To date, over 50 chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been identified, and are grouped into four categories (C, CC, CXC and CX3C) according to the location of the main cysteine residues near the N terminal of these proteins. The chemokine receptor system extends to most human neoplastic cells and was found to be altered dramatically in neoplastic tissue, particularly at the leading edge of invasion. CXCL16 is one of the only two known plasma membrane chemokines. In a previous study, CXCL16 was found not only in immune cells, but also expressed constitutively in cancer cells of different origins. CXCR6 was identified as a cognate receptor of CXCL16 usually expressed by peripheral blood leukocytes. Interestingly, CXCR6 also has been shown to be present in prostate tissues and in the marrow.Our previous study and other studies have proposed an important role for CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis in the metastasis of different tumors including prostate, liver, ovarian cancers. Through a cytokine antibody array, Lu et al. reported that CXCL16 protein production was increased in aggressive PCa cells compared to the less aggressive PCa cells or benign prostate cells. These observations raise the possibility that CXCL16/CXCR6 interactions may be important for tumor invasion and metastasis, as was demonstrated for CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine axis. Recently, Cheng's studies indicate that different invasive breast cancer (BC) cell lines express CXCR6 at different levels, positively correlated with its invasive ability; however, whether CXCR6 plays a role in BC invasion and metastasis is still kept unclear.BC is the leading cause of cancer in women worldwide. The molecular basis of the complex biochemical processes involved in BC, including tumor growth and metastasis, is becoming increasingly understood. Poor prognosis and high mortality are explicitly correlated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Tumor cell invasion and metastasis are a complex process; however, the increasing evidence has recently shown that the chemokines and their receptors are involved. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis may prove beneficial to prevent metastasis and provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for BC.Here we found that CXCR6 expression was significantly higher in BC tissues and the metastatic lymph nodes than in normal breast tissues. Moreover, we found that CXCR6 increased cell migration, invasion and metastasis, associated with increased phosphorylation of p42/44MAPK (ERK1/2) proteins. In contrast, reduction of CXCR6 expression by shRNAs in these cells greatly reduced these effects. Notable, we found that the enhanced activity of ERK1/2 pathway was able to activate RhoA, one of members of the RhoGTPase family. The effect led to inhibiting the activity of cofilin, thereby enhancing the stability of F-actin, associated with the invasiveness and metastasis of BC.RESULTSExpression of CXCR6 in BC tissues and cell linesEmerging evidence suggests that CXCR6 expression is responsible for progression in multiple cancers. However, its role in BC development still remains unclear. In this regard, high-density tissue microarrays were stained with an anti-human CXCR6 antibody from clinical samples obtained from a cohort of about 300 patients. Representative images are shown in Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1A, demonstrating that CXCR6 expression increases in the primary tumor and metastatic lymph node, whereas normal epithelium demonstrates weak cytoplasm staining. Quantitative analysis confirms that CXCR6 expression is increased in tumor (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 1). Similar results are observed in malignant BC cell lines by flow cytometric analysis (Figure 1C). Therefore these findings suggest that CXCR6 expression may be correlated with BC progression.CXCR6 is higher expressed in BC tissues and cell lines than in the normal controlsA) CXCR6 immunohistochemical staining in a human BC tissue microarray. Representative microscopic images of normal breast, and BC tissues stained with an anti-human CXCR6 antibody (1:200, Epitomics). Scale bar, 50 \u03bc m. B) Chi-square test was used to analysis the CXCR6 expression differences in tumor and normal tissues. Based on staining intensity, the samples were classified into three groups with increasing staining intensity from the weakest (low) to the strongest (high). CXCR6 expression in BC tissues is significantly higher than in normal breast tissues (including para-carcinoma tissues). C) CXCR6 positive expression rate of normal mammary epithelial cell HBL100 and variety of BC cell lines was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells incubated with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated monoclonal anti-human CXCR6 (R&D, Cat, FAB699A) for 30-45 minutes at 2-8\u00b0C were detected by flow cytometry for CXCR6 expression. The histogram shows the ratio of CXCR6 positive cells in the presented cell lines.CXCR6 promotes BC cell migration and invasionA critical feature of BC is highly aggressive behavior in distant metastasis sites including lymph node, bone, lung, and live, et al.. To further explore the role of CXCR6 in BC progression, lentiviral vectors were utilized to overexpress CXCR6 in MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells (termed as MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6), or reduce CXCR6 expression mediated by shRNAs (termed as MDA-231shCXCR6). After clone selection, individual clones were selected and pooled. Figure 2A showed that overexpression of CXCR6 in both cells was confirmed by flow cytometry.CXCR6 promotes BC cells migration and invasionA) CXCR6 was overexpressed in MCF-7 and MDA-231 BC cells by lentiviral system. CXCR6 -positive cells were then sorted by flow cytometry. Histogram displays the ratio of CXCR6 positive expression of MCF-7CXCR6, MDA-231CXCR6 and their respective control cells. B) Scratch wound healing assay shows that overexpression of CXCR6 enhanced cell migration in MDA-231 cells, but not very significant in MCF-7 cells. C) Matrigel invasion assay showed that overexpression of CXCR6 significantly enhanced cell invasion in both MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells (***P < 0.001). Experiments were performed 3 times; representative images of invaded cells are shown. Mean \u00b1 SD. D) Cytometry analysis showed CXCR6 had no effect on cell cycle.Once individual tumor cells are bound to the endothelium, they must invade through the extracellular matrix in order to establish a metastasis. The ability of CXCR6 to regulate migration and invasion was assessed by scratch healing assay and using reconstituted extracellular matrices in porous culture chambers. The results show that MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells gradually closed the wound at 48 hour after scratch, whereas the respective control cells didn't gain the effect (Figure 2B). In line with this finding, the invasive capacity was greatly increased in MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells (Figure 2C).To exclude the potential effect of cell proliferation on migration and invasion, we next assayed cell cycle distribution by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 2D, we found that overexpression of CXCR6 did not apparently affect cell cycle progression (Supplementary Figure 2). Taken together, these results confirm that CXCR6 plays a role in migration and invasion of BC cells.Activation of ERK1/2 signaling by CXCR6 promotes BC cell invasionCXCR6, as a G protein-coupled receptor, can be combined with its cognate ligand CXCL16 to activate downstream signaling pathways. Previously, we demonstrated that CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis induces prostate cancer progression by the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.Next, we determine which pathway is involved in activation of CXCR6 by CXCL16 stimulation, associated with BC cell invasion. As shown in Figure 3A, Western blot analyses show that stimulation of CXCL16 can apparently activate ERK1/2 pathway by a time-dependent manner in MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells compared with the respective control cells. To further confirm that ERK1/2 pathway is responsible for CXCR6-induced cell invasion, we blocked ERK1/2 activation by U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinase in upstream of ERK1/2 signaling. The result shows that U0126 is able to greatly block the increasing invasion caused by CXCR6 overexpression in MCF-7 and MDA-231cells (Figure 3B). In contrast, CXCR6 knockdown in MDA-231CXCR6 cells by shRNAs, ERK1/2 activity is greatly inhibited, followed by the reduction of cell invasion (Figure 3C and 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that CXCL16 stimulation through CXCR6 activates ERK1/2 signaling pathway in BC cells, responsible for cell invasion.CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis promotes cell invasion by ERK1/2 signalling dependant mannerA) BC cells treated with CXCL16 (100 ng/ml) for indicated time (0, 30, 60 minutes), the pERK1/2 pathway was significantly activated in MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells. The experiments were performed three times. B) Matrigel invasion assay showed when block the pERK1/2 pathway with U0126, the CXCR6 induced cell invasion capacities reduced in both MCF-7 and MDA-231 (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). Experiments were performed 3 times; representative images of invaded cells are shown. Mean \u00b1 SD. C) CXCR6 knockdown by shRNA1#, 2#, 3# can attenuate the pERK1/2 pathway in 231CXCR6 cells. The experiments were performed three times. D) Matrigel invasion assay showed CXCR6 knockdown by shRNA1#, 2#, 3# inhibited cell invasiveness (*P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001). Experiments were performed 3 times; representative images of invaded cells are shown. Mean \u00b1 SD.CXCR6 modulates formation of stress fibers in an ERK1/2 signaling dependent mannerFactors that affect cellular motility or invasion include cellular polarity, cytoskeleton organization, and transduction of signals from the outside environment. To investigate the state of cell polarity, we initially detected the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin. Western analysis show that cells treated with CXCL16 at different time points, both E-cadherin and vimentin are no significant changes (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting that CXCL16/CXCR6 signaling is irresponsible for EMT, potentially involved in BC invasion.In this regard, to explore potential downstream targets induced by CXCR6, we analyzed the genome-wide transcriptome profile of MCF-7CXCR6, MDA-231CXCR6 and their respective control cells by Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarrays. The microarray data set has been deposited in the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60484). According to fold-change (\u00d72.0) screening between CXCR6 overexpression and its respective control, 49 genes exhibit consistent change trend in both MDA-231CXCR6 \u03bds MDA-231GFP and MCF-7CXCR6 \u03bds MCF-7GFP cell pairs, in which 35 genes are down-regulated and 14 genes are up-regulated (Supplementary Figure 4A). Supplementary Figure 4C and 4D show the cluster mapping of the picked up 49 genes might participate in invasion or metastasis by the MeV 4.6 microarray analysis software. Gene ontology (GO) cellular component analysis shows the cytoskeleton is the secondly largest fold enrichment GO term (Supplementary Figure 4B), which suggesting that CXCR6 induced cell migration and invasion may involve the changes in cytoskeleton. All those genes with more than 2 fold change are showed in Supplementary Figure 5A and B. Real-time PCR was used to further confirm the above microarray results as shown in Supplementary Figure 5C.Among the genes markedly regulated by CXCR6 overexpression in MDA-231 and MCF-7 cells, we focused on ACTG2 (Supplementary Figure 4D and 5C), which is the monomeric form of F-actin. F-actin as actin stress fibers is one of the major cytoskeletal structures, closely responsible for the elevated cellular motility and invasion. Here, we firstly examined the cytoskeletal morphology by immunofluorescence staining of F-actin. The result shows that actin stress fibers are somehow increased in MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells compared with the respective controls even in absence of CXCL16 stimulation (Figure 4A and 4B). However, stimulation of CXCL16 induces more intense expression of actin stress fibers in MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells than in the respective controls (Figure 4A and 4B). Quantitative analyses confirm the above observations (Figure 4A and 4B).CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis promotes stress fibres assembly through ERK1/2 pathwayA) and B) CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis promotes F-actin assembly. Cells treated with or without CXCL16 for 5 minutes, F-actin was visualized by Rhodamine-phalloidin under a Zeiss LSM 710 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy. The fluorescence intensity was quantified using Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. C) and D) ERK1/2 pathway involves in CXCL16/CXCR6 induced F-actin assembly. Pretreatment of cells with or without U0126 or Y27632 for 30 minutes, then continue treatment with CXCL16 for 5 minutes, F-actin was visualized as previous mentioned.As previously reported, Rho/ROCK activation could lead to actomyosin-based contractility and actin cytoskeletal reorganization through indirectly phosphorylating cofilin and MLC, which could alter the integrity of TJ(tight junction). To elucidate the mechanistic roles of CXCR6 in cytoskeleton organization, inhibitors of ERK1/2 and Rho/ROCK pathways were next used. Immunofluorescence assays show that U0126 is able to apparently block the intense expression of actin stress fibers caused by CXCR6 overexpression in both cells in presence of CXCL16 stimulation. Similar findings are observed in Y27632 treatment, an inhibitor of the Rho/ROCK pathway (Figure 4C and 4D). Quantitative analyses confirm the above observations (Figure 4C, and 4D). In contrast, reduction of CXCR6 expression by shRNAs in MDA-231CXCR6 cells potentially decreased the intense expression of actin stress fibers compared with the respective control (Figure 4E). To further explore the effect, we found that the phosphorylation levels of cofilin are up-regulated by CXCL16 in dose-dependent manner, suggesting that cofilin is involved in regulating process through CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis. In addition, FAK is activated by CXCL16 stimulation, which may partly contributed to the enhanced cell migration and invasion (Supplementary Figure 6A).Overall, these results suggest that CXCL16 stimulation through CXCR6 may modulate formation of stress fibers in an ERK1/2/RhoA/cofilin signaling dependent manner.RhoA/cofilin regulated by ERK 1/2 signaling contributes to the formation of stress fibersThe above findings also suggest that the formation of stress fibers is regulated by the small GTP-binding protein Rho. The small GTPase Rho is inactive in its guanosine diphosphate (GDP)- bound form and active in its guanosine triphosphate (GTP)- bound form, which binds to specific targets that mediate its biological functions including the formation of actin stress fibers.Active RhoA pull-down assays initially show that GTP-RhoA expression is increased in MCF-7 and MDA-231 control cells when treated with CXCL16 for 5 min (Figure 5A). Notable, the result also indicates that CXCR6 overexpression induces more active GTP-RhoA expression in both cells than in the respective controls, regardless of CXCL16 treatment (Figure 5A). Based on the findings, we next explore whether the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is able to regulate RhoA activity. As shown in Figure. 5B, blocking the ERK1/2 pathway with U0126 significantly reduced the activation of RhoA in MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells (Figure 5B). These findings suggest that CXCL16/CXCR6 signaling pathway regulates the activity of RhoA in an ERK1/2 dependent manner.RhoA GTPase mediates F-actin assembly and BC cell migration and invasionA) CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis promotes the activation of RhoA. B) Pretreatment of cells with or without U0126 for 30 minutes, then continue treatment with CXCL16 for 5 minutes, GTP-RhoA was isolated using active Rho pull-down and detect kit, total RhoA in the total cell lysates and GTP-RhoA were detected by Western- blot analysis. C) MDA-231CXCR6 cells were transfected with RhoAV14-flag or RhoAN19-flag plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000, 24 hours later, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence assay, F-actin (Red) and flag (Green) were detected under a Zeiss LSM 710 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy. D) Inactivation of RhoA in BC cells reduces migration properties. MDA-231CXCR6 cells were transfected with RhoAN19-flag or control plasmids for wound healing assay. Representative images at time points 0 and 18 hours. E) Matrigel invasion assay shows RhoA activity positively correlated with cell invasion. Experiments were performed 3 times; representative images of invaded cells are shown. Mean \u00b1 SD.To further explore the role of RhoA in the formation of stress fibers, we transfected the constitutively active RhoA vector RhoAV14 or dominant negative RhoA vector RhoAN19 in MDA-231CXCR6 cells, either of which was tagged with three Flag-tags at C terminal. Immunofluorescence assays show that more intense F-actin formation is observed in RhoAV14-trensfected MDA-231CXCR6 cells than the control. In contrast, RhoAN19-trensfected MDA-231CXCR6 cells induce less F-actin formation (Figure 5C). Quantitative analyses confirm the above observations (Figure 5C). Moreover, wound healing assay shows that RhoAN19-transfected MDA-231CXCR6 cells significantly reduce BC cell migration and invasion, while RhoAV14-transfected MDA-231CXCR6 cells significantly enhance BC cell invasion compared with the control (Figure 5D-E). These findings suggest that the activated RhoA promotes BC cell invasion and migration, and vice versa.Given CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis promotes RhoA activation and the formation of F-actin is regulated by activity of RhoA, we transfected dominant negative RhoAN19 into MDA-231CXCR6 cells. Supplementary Figure 6B shows that phosphorylation of cofilin is inhibited by DN-RhoAN19. These findings suggest that the stress fibers formation by CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis is potentially responsible for RhoA/cofilin pathway, which is capable of enhancing stability of stress fibers.Taken together, these data suggest that CXCR6 expression induces the increased formation of stress fibers in BC cells, dependent on the RhoA/cofilin pathway in an ERK1/2 dependent manner, which promotes BC cell migration and invasion.Effect of targeting CXCR6 expression on tumor metastasis in vivoTo further evaluate whether CXCR6 induces tumor metastasis in vivo, we transplanted MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# and respective MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl cells tagged with luciferase into nude balb/c mice by tail vein injection. The results show that MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2#cells significantly reduced lung metastasis compared with MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl cells. The bioluminescence imaging noted that MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl cells formed obviously more lung metastasis compared with MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# cells regardless of whether the animal was imaged from ventral surface (Figure 6A) in 8 weeks. Examination of the number of micrometastasis also showed that lung metastasis was markedly decreased in MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# mice compared with control mice (Figure 6B). The macroscopic findings were further confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 6C), suggesting that CXCR6 knockdown significantly inhibits BC cells lung metastasis. Additionally, pERK1/2 IHC staining showed that ERK1/2 pathway was significantly suppressed in MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# group as compared with MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl, while ERK1/2 expressed no difference in two groups (Figure 6C). These results suggest that reducing CXCR6 expression has a significant effect on inhibiting invasion and metastasis of BC cells by inactivating ERK1/2 pathway.Targeting CXCR6 expression reduces lung metastasis of BC in vivoA) Targeting CXCR6 expression reduces lung metastasis in transplantable nude balb/c mouse models. Representative bioluminescence images of animals on week 8 are shown. each group n=5, mean \u00b1 SEM. B) Representative images of lung nodules. MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl group mice have marked lung metastases as compared with respective MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# group mice. Arrows point to the location of metastases. Mean \u00b1 SEM. C) HE staining of lung tissue and immunohistochemical evaluation of pERK1/2, and ERK in BC tumors grown in nude balb/c mice. Luciferase tagged MDA-231CXCR6/shCtrl, and respective MDA-231CXCR6/shCXCR6-2# cells were respectively injected into tail vein. After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and lungs were harvested and processed for HE staining or immunohistochemistry staining for pERK1/2 and ERK1/2. Original magnification \u00d710\u00d75 (up) and the white or red frame selected areas were enlarged to magnification \u00d710\u00d720 (down), where the red bars represents 50 \u03bcm.DISCUSSIONCXCL16 is a type I membrane protein containing a non-ELR motif-containing CXC chemokine domain in its extracellular region. The cognate receptor for CXCL16 has been identified as CXCR6, a receptor previously shown to be a co-receptor for HIV entry (25, 26). Several groups indicated that CXCL16/CXCR6 signaling correlates with liver-specific homing and lung-specific homing in the events of inflammation. Increasing evidence has shown that CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis plays multifaceted roles in a variety of cancers, including three major aspects of their activities: (1) CXCL16/CXCR6 functions as a regulator in migration and proliferation of a variety of cancer cells; (2) CXCR6 functions as a newly defined biomarker of tissue-specific stem cell; (3) regulating angiogenic processes. Our previous studies have demonstrated that CXCL16 signaling through CXCR6 may contribute to prostate cancer progression by serving as a proliferative signal and as a regulator of invasion; however, its role and mechanism of in BC development is still kept unsettled.In this investigation, we demonstrate that a higher CXCR6 expression in nest site and metastatic lymph node is responsible for BC progression. A similar correlation has been demonstrated in patients with gliomas, nasopharyngeal tumors, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanomas, suggesting that CXCR6 expression is important for invasion and metastasis of multiple tumors. Moreover, we found that CXCR6 increased cell migration, invasion and metastasis, associated with increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 proteins.Our previous study suggests CXCR6 induces PCa progression by the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Whether the ERK pathway is regulated by CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis in PCa cells has not shown in this study. Here, our results show that ERK pathway is activated only after CXCL16 stimulating 5 minutes in both C4-2BCXCR6 and LNCaPCXCR6 cells. However, this activation is only maintained for a very short period of time (Supplementary Figure 7A). Whether the early and short activations of the ERK pathway induced by CXCL16 stimulation play a role in PCa progression needs further study. Meanwhile, we also detected the AKT/mTOR pathway in BC. The results show that the slight activation of AKT is observed in MCF-7 and MDA-231 cells, but the phosphorylation of P70S6K is rarely changed with CXCL16 treatment in different time pints regardless of CXCR6 expression in MDA-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 7B and 7C). In contrast, the ERK pathway is obviously activated in both MCF-7CXCR6 and MDA-231CXCR6 cells (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 7B and D). These findings suggest the ERK pathway induced by CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis may play more important roles than the AKT/mTOR pathway in BC progression.In mechanistic analyses, we uncover that RhoA, a member of Rho family GTPase, is involved in these effects. The RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 are prototypical members of Rho family representing three canonical sub-groups, Different Rho GTPases can produce independent as well as redundant effects. During the process of cell migration, each member of this Rho family GTPase plays a distinct role. RhoA is important for regulating the formation of contractile actin-myosin filaments, which form stress fibers, and for maintaining focal adhesions at the rear of the migrating cells.Accumulating evidence has shown that both cancer invasion and metastasis are directly linked to activation of cofilin, which is regulated by phosphorylation status on Ser3. Cofilin and ADF (actin-depolymerization factor) are members of a family of essential conserved small actin-binding proteins that play pivotal roles in cytokinesis, endocytosis, embryonic development, stress response and tisuue regeneration. In response to stimuli, cofilin often promotes the regeneration of actin filaments by severing preexisting filaments. The severing activity of cofilin is inhibited by RhoA/ROCK/LIMK phosphorylation at Ser3. In this investigation, we found that CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis enhances activity of ERK1/2 pathway, which activates RhoA. RhoA activation could lead to actomyosin-based contractility and actin cytoskeletal reorganization through indirectly phosphorylating cofilin and MLC, which could alter the integrity of TJ (tight junction). Blocking ERK1/2 activation by U0126 apparently decreased the intense expression of actin stress fibers caused by CXCR6 expression. In contrast, reduction of CXCR6 expression in BC cells potentially inhibited the effect. Similar findings were observed in these cells using Y27632 treatment, an inhibitor of the Rho/ROCK pathway. Therefore, CXCR6 expression induces activation of small GTPase RhoA in an ERK1/2 dependent manner. Moreover, it is able to inhibit the activity of cofilin, resulting in enhancing the stability of F-actin, which is associated with the invasiveness and metastasis of BC. To our knowledge, this represents the first report describing the contribution of CXCR6 to activating the ERK1/2/ RhoA/ cofilin /F-actin pathway in BC development. It is important to note that since the ERK1/2 cascade cross-talks with other pathways including AKT (Supplementary Figure. 6C), combinations of ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors with other therapeutic agents have produced synergistic effects on inhibiting tumor growth in experimental models and in some clinical trials. The immediate challenge is therefore to determine how ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors can be applied in a tumor-specific manner to minimize adverse effects by blocking a pathway with broad biologic significance.In addition, we found that CXCR6-overexpressing BC cells acquired polar cell morphology and exhibited the enhanced cellular motility (40). It suggests that alteration of CXCR6 may induce Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the process of BC progression. However, our results show that overexpression of CXCR6 and then treatment with CXCL16 for 24 or 48 hours in BC cells didn't alter the apparent expression of E-cadherin epithelial markers and vimentin mesenchymal markers (Supplementary Figure 3). These results suggest that CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis may have no function on EMT in the process of BC progression. Cell morphological changes may be due to the changes of cytoskeletal system mediated by F-actin rearrangements.In vivo data show CXCR6 knockdown significantly reduced BC cells lung metastasis. In line with the finding, IHC stainings show the ERK1/2 pathway was significantly suppressed in lung metastases, suggesting that ERK1/2 pathway may play a key role in CXCR6- promoted BC cells distant metastases.Overall, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying the CXCR6 / ERK1/2/ RhoA / cofilin /F-actin pathway in the development of BC as shown a working model in Figure 7. Blocking the signaling pathway may provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for BC.Schematic diagram showing a novel regulatory mechanism for CXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis -induced BC progressionCXCL16/CXCR6 chemokine axis modulates activation of RhoA through activating ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which inhibits the activity of cofilin, thereby enhancing the stability of F-actin, responsible for BC invasiveness and metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell culturesThe human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-231, MDA-468, MDA-435, MDA-453 and SK-BR-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured according to the online instructions of the manufacturer. The immortalized epithelial cell line HBL-100 (Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China) was maintained in DMEM (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO). The human prostate cancer (PCa) cell line LNCaP was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The metastatic subline LNCaP C4-2B (C4-2B) cells were originally isolated from a lymph node of a PCa patient with disseminated bone and lymph node involvement. LNCaP and C4-2B cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in an RPMI-1640 medium supplemented 10% FBS. All BC (MCF-7CXCR6, MDA-231CXCR6) and PCa (C4-2BCXCR6, LNCaPCXCR6) cell lines stably expressing CXCR6 and the respective GFP-expressing control cells were cultivated in DMEM or RPMI-1640 (Corning Cellgro) supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml G418. MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl and MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml puromysin and 100 \u03bcg/ml G418. All wild-type cell lines were tested and authenticated by DNA typing in the Shanghai JiaoTong University Analysis Core (last test in April 2013). Cells were cultured in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2 and held at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C.Detection of CXCR6 expression by flow cytometryCells cultivated in 100 mm dishes were digested by 0.25% trypsin (supplemented with 0.5mM EDTA). After washed with PBS for 3 times, cells then were resuspended in an isotonic PBS buffer to a final concentration of 4 \u00d7 106 cells/ml and 25 \u03bcl of cells were transferred to a 5 ml tube for CXCR6 staining. In brief, after Fc-blocked by IgG, cells were cultivated with APC-conjugated anti-CXCR6 reagent (R&D, CAT: FAB699A). Then resuspend the cells in PBS buffer for flow cytometric analysis. Details are show in the supplementary materials and methods.Active RhoA pull-down assaysThe assays were performed with the Active Rho Pull-Down and Detection kit (CAT#: 0016116, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacture's instruction. In brief, cells were lysed by 1\u00d7lysis buffer and the same amount of total proteins was incubated with agarose beads and GST-Rhotekin-RBD protein-binding domain. After incubation at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, the samples were washed three times with 0.4 ml of 1\u00d7 lysis buffer. Following the last wash, 50 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 reducing buffer was added to the samples and incubated at room temperature for 2 min. At last the samples were collected by centrifugation at 6000g for 2 min and were electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by western blot analysis.Stress fiber analysisCancer cells of ~30% confluence were starved for 30 min, and then treated with DMSO or inhibitors (2 \u03bcM U0126 (CAT: S1102, Selleck), 10 \u03bcM Y27632 (CAT: S1049, Selleck), 10 \u03bcM PF573228 (CAT: S2013, Selleck)) for 30 min following treated with or without 100 ng/ml rhCXCL16 for additional 5min, and then the cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde without methanol. Then cells were stained with rhodamine phalloidin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). More than 25 individual cells per treatment group were visualized by confocal microscopy (LSM-710META, Carl Zeiss) in each experiment. The numbers of stress fibers in each cell was quantitated as previously described. Briefly, the Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to generate line profiles for each cell. A graphic depiction was then generated where the x axis represented the distance across the cell, the y axis represented the level of fluorescence and each immunofluorescence intensity spike represented an individual stress fiber crossed by the line. The fluorescence intensity level of 100 was set as the cutoff of stress fiber spike, as the background intensities outside cells were never greater than this value.Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistryThe immunohistochemical analysis was performed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with an anti-CXCR6, anti-pERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibody. Details are provided in the Supplementary materials and methods section.Construction of CXCR6 stably overexpression cellsThe full-length human CXCR6 cDNA were amplified from MDA-231 cells by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into the lentivirus vector pLenti-easy-HA. Lenti-x cells were then transfected with the pMD2.G, psPAX2 and pLenti-easy-CXCR6 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, culture supernatants were collected, passed through 0.45 \u03bcm filters, and mixed with fresh media (1:1) and polybrene (8 \u03bcg/ml) to infect target cells. Cells with restored expression of CXCR6 were designated as MCF-7CXCR6, MDA-231CXCR6, C4-2BCXCR6 and LNCaPCXCR6, the respective controls cells infected with pLenti-easy-GFP lentiviral vectors were designated as MCF-7GFP, MDA-231GFP, C4-2BGFP and LNCaPGFP. Then the CXCR6 positive cells and GFP control cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Stable cell lines were established using G418 selection.Construction of RhoA and mutated RhoA plasmidsRhoA cDNA was amplified from MDA-231 cells and were inserted into p3\u00d7FLAG-CMV-14 plasmid vector, and the RhoAV14, RhoAN19 mutation plasmids were constructed using KOD-Plus- Mutagenesis Kit (CAT: KOD-201, TOYOBO) according to the manufacturer protocal. In brief, firstly, the mutation sites were designed to N terminal of forward primer, and then use wild-type RhoA-p3\u00d7FLAG-CMV-14 plasmid as a template for reverse PCR. Secondly, digest the template plasmid by Dpn I enzyme. Thirdly, perform self-ligation of the PCR product by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Finally, Use E. coli DH5\u03b1 as the transformation host for plasmids transformation. All primers are shown in supplementary Table 2.Western blot analysisThe expression of proteins was evaluated using western blot analysis. In brief, 2.5-5.0\u00d7105 cells in 6-well plates were incubated with 100 ng/ml of rhCXCL16 (CAT#: 976-CX-025, R&D) pretreated with or without ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, the MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor U0126 for the designated time points. The cells were then washed in PBS and suspended in 100 \u03bcl of RIPA buffer (Pierce). Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Supernatant samples containing 30\u03bcg total protein were resolved by 10% or 12.5% SDS\u2013PAGE gels depending on the sizes of target proteins, transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by electroblotting, and then probed with anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-Cofilin, anti-phospho-Cofilin, anti-P70S6K, anti-phospho-P70S6K, anti-GAPDH, anti-RhoA, anti-E-adherin, anti-vimentin (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CXCR6 antibodies (Epitomics). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using an ECL kit (Millipore).Migration and invasion assaysA wound healing assay was used to assess cell migration ability and cell invasion was examined using a reconstituted extracellular matrix membrane (CAT: 354483, BD, USA). The procedures are as our previously described.shRNA transfectionLenti-x cells were transfected with the pMD2.G, psPAX2 and shRNA-CXCR6 plasmids or shRNA vectors (GV248 lentiviral vectors) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, culture supernatants were collected, passed through 0.45 \u03bcm filters, and mixed with fresh media (1:1) and polybrene (8 \u03bcg/ml) to infect MDA-231CXCR6 cells. Cells infected with three different shRNA-CXCR6 or control vectors were respectively designated as MDA-231CXCR6/shCXCR6-1#, -2# and -3# and MDA-231CXCR6/shCtrl. Stable cell lines were established using 1 \u03bcg/ml puromysin selection. The seed sequences of shRNA-CXCR6-1#, -2# and-3# as follows: 1#: 5\u2032-CTGAGGACAATTCCAAGACTT-3\u2032, 2#: 5\u2032-CTCACCATGATTGTCTGCTAT-3\u2032, 3#: 5\u2032-GCTTGCTCATCTGGGTGATAT-3\u2032.Metastasis assay in vivoThe modified transplantation through tail vein injection is referred to in the report of Zheng et al. Briefly, Tail vein injections were performed to determine whether knockdown of CXCR6 expression played a role in metastasis. Using a 1 ml syringe fitted with a 25-gauge needle, 5- to 6-week-old nude balb/c mice (Slaccas Laboratory Animal, Shanghai, China) were injected into tail vein with MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCXCR6-2# and respective MDA-231-lucCXCR6/shCtrl cells (1\u00d7 106/0.1 ml/mouse). After 8 weeks, bioluminescence was utilized to follow the BC cell-derived tissue metastases. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 \u03bcl of 15 mg/ml luciferin prior to the Xenogen IVIS cryogenically cooled imaging system to detect the tumor metastasis.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0. Differences among variables were analyzed by 2-tailed Student's t tests. Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SD unless otherwise indicated. Chi-square test was used to analyze the CXCR6 expression differences in tissue microarray. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS AND METHODS, FIGURES AND TABLESDISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.REFERENCESChemokine receptors in cancer metastasis and cancer cell-derived chemokines in host immune responseThe biology of chemokines and their receptorsCXCR6/CXCL16 functions as a regulator in metastasis and progression of cancerCXCR6 induces prostate cancer progression by the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathwayExpression analysis and clinical significance of CXCL16/CXCR6 in patients with bladder cancerExpression of the CXCL12/CXCR4 and CXCL16/CXCR6 axes in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancerDistribution and kinetics of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 and CXCR6 expression on human dendritic cell subsets and CD4+ T cellsExpression cloning of new receptors used by simian and human immunodeficiency virusesCXCR6 Upregulation Contributes to a Proinflammatory Tumor Microenvironment That Drives Metastasis and Poor Patient Outcomes in Hepatocellular CarcinomaChemokine axes CXCL12/CXCR4 and CXCL16/CXCR6 correlate with lymph node metastasis in epithelial ovarian carcinomaCXCL16 functions as a novel chemotactic factor for prostate cancer cells in vitroUse of the stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCR4 pathway in prostate cancer metastasis to bone[Expression of Chemokine receptor CXCR6 and its significance in breast cancer cell lines]Cancer statistics, 2010CXCR6 induces prostate cancer progression by the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathwayCXCR6, a newly defined biomarker of tissue-specific stem cell asymmetric self-renewal, identifies more aggressive human melanoma cancer stem cellsTriple-negative breast cancer: risk factors to potential targetsTriple-negative breast cancerEpithelial cell polarity affects susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa invasion and cytotoxicityExtra-nuclear signaling of progesterone receptor to breast cancer cell movement and invasion through the actin cytoskeletonActin-associated protein palladin promotes tumor cell invasion by linking extracellular matrix degradation to cell cytoskeletonCellular motility driven by assembly and disassembly of actin filamentsSignaling from Rho to the actin cytoskeleton through protein kinases ROCK and LIM-kinasePhosphorylation and activation of myosin by Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase)Rho as a regulator of the cytoskeletonThe small GTP-binding protein rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to growth factorsFibroblast migration is mediated by CD44-dependent TGF beta activationHIC1 silencing in triple-negative breast cancer drives progression through misregulation of LCN2HIC1 modulates prostate cancer progression by epigenetic modificationBonzo/CXCR6 expression defines type 1-polarized T-cell subsets with extralymphoid tissue homing potentialRole for CXCR6 and its ligand CXCL16 in the pathogenesis of T-cell alveolitis in sarcoidosisCXCL16-mediated cell recruitment to rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue and murine lymph nodes is dependent upon the MAPK pathwayChemokine receptor expression profiles in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and their association with metastasis and radiotherapyOverexpression of CXCL16 and its receptor CXCR6/Bonzo promotes growth of human schwannomasExpression and potential function of the CXC chemokine CXCL16 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCXCL16 signals via Gi, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, I kappa B kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa B and induces cell-cell adhesion and aortic smooth muscle cell proliferationEnhanced expression and shedding of the transmembrane chemokine CXCL16 by reactive astrocytes and glioma cellsExpression of chemokine receptor CXCR6 in human colorectal adenocarcinomasMatrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in bile as a marker of liver metastasis in colorectal cancerProfiles of chemokine receptors in melanocytic lesions: de novo expression of CXCR6 in melanomaMammalian Rho GTPases: new insights into their functions from in vivo studiesRho family GTPases and their regulators in lymphocytesThe cofilin pathway in breast cancer invasion and metastasisControl of actin dynamics in cell motility.

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view.

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG).

(g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs.

Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

Fibroblasts within the tumor stroma, referred to as \u201ccancer-associated fibroblasts\u201d or CAFs, exhibit a cancer-associated phenotype and have been demonstrated to be major players in cancer progression. Mechanisms whereby CAFs promote tumor progression and metastasis include: 1) extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by upregulation of the proteoglycan syndecan I and alterations in collagen composition and 2) secretion of soluble growth factors or cytokines that support cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration. In addition, CAFs may facilitate metastasis by direct contact with cancer cells. The relationship between cancer cells and fibroblasts in tumorigenesis is, therefore, reciprocal.Here we have explored reciprocal signaling and physical interactions between breast cancer-derived tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) as well as between MDA-MB-231 cells and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) in a 3D Matrigel environment in which cancer cells, but not normal cells, aggregate. Aggregates then coalesce to form large aggregates with shapes reflective of their tumor of origin. We found that breast tumor cells release an activation factor(s) that causes changes in both dermal and mammary fibroblast shape and motility, and alterations in gene expression. Although the altered gene expression pattern differs between activated dermal and activated mammary fibroblasts, both types of activated fibroblasts markedly accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence relative to unconditioned fibroblasts. Interestingly, activated mammary fibroblasts are even more effective at inducing coalescence of MDA-MB-231than activated NHDFs.The activated fibroblasts, referred to here as cancer cell conditioned-normal human dermal fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) or cancer cell conditioned-human primary mammary fibroblasts (CC-HPMFs), are imbued with the capacity to invade the 3D Matrigel environment where they accelerate the rate of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence. We found that this acceleration is mediated by 1) soluble factors released by activated fibroblasts and 2) by the dynamic participation of CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, which function as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation. We further demonstrate that overexpressing podoplanin (PDPN), but not fibroblast activation protein (FAP), in NHDFs in the absence of the soluble activators from cancer cell-conditioned medium, activates fibroblasts, and imbues them with the capacity to accelerate cancer cell aggregation and coalescence.The functions described here for activated fibroblasts are distinct from the roles typically attributed to CAFs such as promotion of metastasis by basement membrane remodeling and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data support a model in which CAFs drive coalescence, and by so doing, may promote tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization.Material and methodsGrowth and maintenance of cell lines and primary cellsNormal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and Fibroblast Growth Medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (FGM), insulin (5\u03bcg/mL) and FGF-2 (1ng/mL) were obtained from PromoCell (http://www.promocell.com/) and cells were cultured as specified by the supplier. Human Primary Mammary Fibroblasts (HPMFs), HPMF growth media (HPMF-GM), the Fibroblast Medium Supplement Kit (FBS, hydrocortisone, L-glutamine, FGF and an antibiotic-anti-mycotic solution) and gelatin coating solution were obtained from Cell Biologics (http://www.cellbiologics.net). HPMF cells were cultured in HPMF-GM with the added supplements for 6\u20137 passages as specified by the supplier. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured for 12\u201315 passages in MCF media. MCF medium is DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% horse serum, human recombinant EGF, insulin, hydrocortisone and cholera toxin, all obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and penicillin-streptomycin from Thermo -Fisher (Grand Island, NY). GFP tagged human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs-GFP) were obtained from Angio-proteomie (www.angioproteomie.com) and cultured according to the supplier\u2019s directions.Activation of fibroblasts by MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium and assay preparationsTo generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblast growth media (CC-FGM), MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in 10 mL of FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum (Fig 1A1). The CC-FGM medium was then withdrawn from the culture flask and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to remove any detached MDA-MB-231cells or cell debris. To generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) (Fig 1B1), NHDFs were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in the filtered CC-FGM plus 30% fresh FGM. As a control, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency in FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum for 72 hours to generate fibroblast conditioned FGM (F-FGM) (Fig 1A2). The F-FGM was collected and filtered in the same manner as the CC-FGM. Next, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency for 72 hours in the filtered F-FGM to generate fibroblast cell conditioned fibroblasts (F-NHDFs) (Fig 1B2). Cancer cell conditioned HPMFs (CC-HPMFs) and fibroblast cell conditioned HPMFs (F-HPMFs) were generated using this same protocol with HPMF-GM. To determine if results were specific to one formula of media, reciprocal media controls were performed by culturing HPMFs in MCF media and CC-MCF media, again following the protocol illustrated in Fig 1. To determine if growth factors in the growth media were responsible for stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to condition the media, minimal conditioned media (CC- minimal MCF) was prepared by culturing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in MCF media without insulin or EGF and supplemented with 10% serum that had been charcoal stripped to remove growth factors (https://www.atlanta-biologicals.com). Finally, as an additional control, fibroblasts were grown in FGM or HPMF-GM that had not been conditioned by either MDA-MB-231 cells or by fibroblasts.The preparation used to analyze fibroblast cell motility and to compare the effects of F-NHDFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs on the aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.To prepare samples for 2D analysis of fibroblast motility, the 30 mm glass insert in a 60 mm Petri dish (https://www.cellvis.com/) was pre-coated with Type I human collagen (https://www.advancedbiomatrix.com) according to the supplier\u2019s instructions. Next, a 500 \u03bcl aliquot containing 5 x 104 NHDFs in FGM, F-NHDFs in F-FGM, CC-NHDFs in CC-FGM, HPMFs in HPMF-GM, F-HPMFs in F-HPMF-GM, or CC-HPMFs in CC-HPMF-GM was dispersed onto the collagen-coated insert. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1C) followed by addition of 5 ml of the appropriate media. To assay coalescence in 2D and 3D in the presence of fibroblasts, fibroblasts were first plated on the collagen-coated insert as described above. MDA-MB-231 cells were then harvested and 5x105 cells in 250 \u03bcl of medium were mixed with ice-cold Matrigel (Fig 1C) as described elsewhere in detail. Medium was removed from the collagen-coated insert and 750 \u03bcl of the cell/Matrigel mixture were gently applied over the fibroblasts (Fig 1D). The Matrigel was allowed to gel by incubating the dishes for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 and 5 ml of MCF media was then added. 2D and 3D images were acquired on a microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1E).2D analysis of fibroblast cell shape and motilityFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert of a Petri dish as described above. 2D images at 4x or 10x magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Illumination and acquisition were synchronized using Fire-I software (www.unibrain.com/products/fire-i-software/). A series of JPEG images were acquired every 45 seconds with a XCD-V50 camera (Sony, San Diego, CA). The images were imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and compiled into JDIAS movie format for motion and shape analysis. Cells were outlined at 7.5 minute intervals for 6 hours. Stacked perimeter plots were generated and length, width, perimeter, area and instantaneous velocity calculated as described previously. J3D-DIAS4.2 calculates persistence as the ratio of net to total path length at 5 frame intervals and averaged over the total path length.2D and 3D analysis of MDA-MB-231 aggregation and aggregate coalescence in the presence of NHDF, F-NHDF, F-HPMF, CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cellsNHDFs, F-NHDF, HPMFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs or CC-HPMFs were plated onto the collagen-coated insert and overlayed with a Matrigel/MDA-MB-231 cell suspension as described above. 2D images at 4X and 10X magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. For 3D analyses of coalescence with DIC optics, a lid with a glass insert was used to cover the dish. 3D cultures were imaged through a 20x objective using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) optics on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a motor-driven stage synchronized to a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 IEEE 1394 color CCD camera and an LED light source. The microscope was housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0in 5% CO2. A z-series of optical sections was acquired through the preparation at 10 \u03bcm increments and this process repeated every 10 minutes for up to 5 days. The z-series was imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and saved in movie format for 3D reconstructions, as previously described.ImmunostainingFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert (described above) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C in 5% CO2 before addition of 5 mL of media to the dish. After 24 hours, the preparation was rinsed with PBS and immunostained as described previously. Cells were stained with the anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (mAb) AMF-17b (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, (DSHB) http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) diluted 1:10 in PBS, or the rat anti-human podoplanin mAb NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS. The AMF-17b preparation was stained with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the NZ-1 preparation with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).qRT-PCRFor RNA preparations, conditioned and unconditioned fibroblast cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in RNAlater solution (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). The TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed to remove DNA. The quality of the RNA was confirmed with the Experion RNA StdSens and HighSens Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad) that assigned an RNA Quality Index (RQI) >9.5 for our samples, indicating little to no RNA degradation had occurred. To generate cDNA from the RNA samples, the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used, as recommended by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR assays were performed with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche) using 50 ng of the cDNA. The expression levels of the genes of interest were quantified using a Roche LightCycler480 real-time PCR detection system with SYBR green. The qRT-PCR assay for each of the tested genes was repeated three times, each in triplicate. The relative expression level of the genes was normalized to that of GAPDH. Primer pairs used for qRT-PCR are listed in S1 Table.Western blot analysis of cell lysates and mediaWestern analysis of protein from cell lysates was performed as previously described. Rat anti-podoplanin NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) and mouse anti-FAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC) were employed as primary antibodies. Mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin mAb E7 (DSHB; http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) was used as a loading control. To assess the release of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, media were concentrated with Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filter devices (Merck Millipore Ltd.) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol. Recombinant human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 (R&D Systems; https://www.rndsystems.com) was used as a positive control. Rabbit anti-human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect the cytokine. IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-rat, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used as secondary antibodies. Odyssey scanner and software were used for detection and quantification of immunoblots (Li-Cor Biosciences).Transwell assay with NHDF cellsA Corning Incorporated Transwell plate with 24 mm inserts, the latter constructed from 0.4 \u03bcm pore membranes (https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en.html), was used to test whether conditioned fibroblasts released a soluble factor capable of traversing the membrane to affect MDA-MB-231 cell behavior in the absence of fibroblast/cancer cell-cell contact. The plate well was first pre-coated with 100 \u03bcl of Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted to 1\u00d7106 cells per ml in MCF medium, chilled on ice, and a 500 \u03bcl aliquot mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold Matrigel. The chilled MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then inoculated into the pre-coated well. F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cultures, containing 4\u00d7104 cells, were suspended in 400 \u03bcl of F-FGM or CC-FGM medium, respectively, and spread on the insert filter over an empty well. The plate was then allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to allow for gelation of the Matrigel as well as attachment of the fibroblasts to the insert filter. Media were removed from the inserts and the inserts transferred on to wells containing the MDA-MB-231 cell/Matrigel mixture. The transwell preparation was incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow gelation of the Matrigel, followed by addition of 2.5 ml of MCF medium to each well. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. To confirm that fibroblasts could not migrate through the insert filter, the transwell assay was performed using NHDF cells in the absence of MDA-MB-231 cells and the bottom well examined microscopically.Development of NHDF overexpression strainsTo overexpress human PDPN and FAP genes transiently in NHDFs, we constructed plasmids pPDPN-C3 and pFAP-C3. To construct the overexpression plasmids, the PDPN and FAP genes were amplified by PCR from the plasmids containing human PDPN cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=443900) and human FAP cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=43440) with the primer pairs PDPN-1/-2 and FAP-1/-2, respectively. The PCR amplified coding regions of the genes were cloned under the control of CMV promoter in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 (BD Bioscienes Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) by enzyme restriction with AgeI and SalI and followed by ligation. To generate a control expression plasmid pmCherry-C3, the EGFP coding region in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 was swapped with the mCherry gene that was amplified from a plasmid with mCherry by PCR with primer pair mCherry-1/-2. Primer pairs used for generating the overexpression and control plasmids are listed in S1 Table. All sequences of the genes were verified after cloning. To generate PDPN and FAP overexpression strains, NHDF-PDPNoe and NHDF-FAPoe transfections of the plasmids into NHDF cells were performed using FuGENE transfection reagent (www.promega.com) according to the supplier\u2019s specifications and confirmed by positive expression of mCherry.Treatment of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN mAbmAb NZ-1, described above, was affinity purified using a Protein G HP spin trap column (GE Healthcare, Cat.#28903134) and concentrated using an ultra-centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Cat.# UFC905024). The concentration was measured by a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and 0.67 \u03bcg added to 4x104 F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs in 200 \u03bcl of medium. The preparations were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The contents of each tube were then divided equally between two collagen-coated wells. As controls, mAb in 200 \u03bcl PBS was processed similarly in the absence of cells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. An MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then cast over the fibroblast cell layer as described above. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope.MMP Gelatinase Zymography and treatment with MMP inhibitorSterile-filtered media were diluted 1:1 with zymogram sample buffer (BioRad) and 20 \u03bcl loaded into each well of a Tris-Glycine Novex 10% zymogram protein gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). SDS-Page gels were run at 118V constant voltage for 90 minutes. Gelatinase activity was detected following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Images of the gel demonstrating cleared regions of enzymatic activity were captured using a light box and Nikon CoolPix camera. Digital images were quantitated using ImageJ software. NHDFs were cultured in CC-FGM with or without 50 \u03bcM of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (http://www.emdmillipore.com) for 72 hours.Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12, anti- SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb and IL-6Recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and human/mouse SDF-1\u03b1 /CXCL12 mAb were obtained from R&D Systems (https://www.rndsystems.com) and reconstituted according to the supplier\u2019s specifications. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 24 hours in 10 ml of MCF media supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the reconstituted protein or supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the protein plus 25 \u03bcg of the anti-SDF-1\u03b1 mAb. To test the effect of IL-6 on MDA-MB-231s, cells were grown for 24 hours in MCF medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6, www.peprotech.co). To test the effect of rIL-6 on MDA-MB-231 cells, the rIL-6 treated MDA-MB-231 cells were embedded in 3D Matrigel as previously described. Images of 10 fields were taken at 24 hour intervals using a 4X objective.ResultsBreast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates NHDFs and alters gene expressionTo determine if treatment of fibroblasts with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells altered the shape and motility of the fibroblasts, NHDF cells were treated with cancer cell conditioned or fibroblast cell conditioned media as described in the Methods. A comparison of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, fixed on a collagen substrate and stained with the anti-vimentin mAb AMF-1b, revealed markedly different morphologies (Fig 2 A and 2B). F-NHDFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 2A), whereas CC-NHDFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 2B). On a collagen-coated 2D substrate, cellular translocation tracks of F-NHDFs were long and persistent, (Fig 2C), while tracks of CC-NHDFs were random and less persistent (Fig 2D). Morphometric measurements revealed that CC-NHDFs were on average significantly longer (Fig 2E), presumably due to the numerous elongated lamellipodia and filopodia, while F-NHDFs were significantly narrower (Fig 2F), and possessed on average a much smaller perimeter (Fig 2G) and a significantly smaller area (Fig 2H), than CC-NHDFs. Instantaneous velocity, computed without directional bias, was similar for CC-NHDFs and F-NHDFs (Fig 2I), but the computed persistence of translocation was significantly higher for F-NHDFs than CC-NHDFs (Fig 2J). These results indicate that factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells alter both the morphology and behavior of dermal fibroblasts.Medium conditioned by the breast tumor-derived cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs affecting polarity, cellular translocation, morphology and gene expression.A, B. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained for vimentin (green) to visualize cell shape, and with DAPI (blue) to visualize nuclei. C-D. Motility tracks at 7.5 minute intervals of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, generated by J3D-DIAS4.2 software that automatically detects cell perimeters and computes tracks. E- J. J3D-DIAS4.2 computations of length, width, perimeter, area, instantaneous velocity and the persistence of translocation. The means and error bar (standard deviations) are presented in all panels for an N = 50. ***** indicates significance of p<0.00005, *** indicates significance p<0.0005, N.S indicates not significant. K. qRT-PCR analyses of the transcript levels of ten genes associated with fibroblast activation. Means and error bars (standard deviations) are presented for N = 3. Asterisk (*) indicates significance of p <0.05. L,M. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1. Arrows denote punctate plasma membrane staining. N. Western blot of F-NHDF and CC-NHDF lysates probed with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1 and the anti-tubulin mAb E7.Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-NHDFs, expression of ten genes previously demonstrated to be involved in fibroblast activation and/or motility was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The genes included vimentin (VIM), PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (ACTA), the tyrosine kinase discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), desmin (DES), FAP, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB), Ca++ binding protein (FSP1/S100A4), and syndecan1 (SDC1). Five of the genes, PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB were up-regulated in CC-NHDFs by more than two-fold (Fig 2K). PDPN was upregulated nine-fold and FAP ten-fold (Fig 2K). F-NHDF cells did not stain with the anti-podoplanin mAb (Fig 2L), but CC-NHDF cells stained intensely (Fig 2M, arrows). Western blot analysis supported the fluorescence data, demonstrating that PDPN was expressed in CC-NHDFs, but not in F-NHDFs (Fig 2N). Western blot analyses of FAP revealed that it was present in F-NHDFs, and the level increased several fold in CC-NHDFs (S1A Fig). Therefore, factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells induce changes in NHDF gene expression consistent with fibroblast activation.CC-NHDF cells accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescenceIn the experimental protocol employed, in the absence of a fibroblast substratum, cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence (hereafter referred to as \u201caggregation and coalescence\u201d) occurred slowly over 192 hours. At 72 hours, cells had moved through the gel, forming small aggregates (Fig 3A, arrows). Aggregation and coalescence continued so that by 144 hours, the great majority of cells in the field resided in a few large aggregates, and the surrounding Matrigel was depleted of single cells as previously described. When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast over F-NHDFs, the rates of aggregation and coalescence were similar (Fig 3A, arrows). When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast in Matrigel over CC-NHDFs, aggregation and coalescence occurred at a dramatically accelerated rate, forming large aggregates by 72 hours (Fig 3A, arrows), at least four-fold greater than preparations cast over F-NHDF cells. Quantitative analysis of the size of aggregates in 10 different fields of duplicate 72 hour cultures confirmed these differences (Fig 3B). The median area of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates formed over CC-NHDFs was more than four-fold larger than those formed over F-NHDFs (Fig 3B).CC-NHDFs but not F-NHDFs accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.A. Representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase is cast over the substrate in the absence of fibroblasts, over F-NHDF cells on collagen and over CC-NHDF cells on collagen. Red arrows indicate MDA-MB-231 aggregates. B. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-NHDF cells (blue) or CC-NHDF cells (orange). The median area of each population is noted as a blue or orange arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-NHDF when compared to F-NHDFs.CC-NHDFs attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds in the 3D model2D imaging suggested that accelerated aggregation and coalescence was more pronounced in the Matrigel region closest to the CC-NHDF substratum. To explore this observation, we used the 3D reconstruction software J3D-DIAS4.2. In Fig 4A and 4B, side views of reconstructions are presented of a MDA-MB-231/Matrigel preparation cast over F-NHDF and CC-NHDF substrates. Fibroblasts are color-coded yellow and MDA-MB-231 cells and aggregates color-coded red. The MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates over the F-NHDF substratum remained dispersed throughout the 3D Matrigel matrix after 24 hours (Fig 4A), whereas MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates accumulated in the Matrigel region closest to the interface with the CC-NHDF substratum (Fig 4B, white arrows). The F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cells were distinguishable from the MDA-MB-231 cells over time by visually monitoring the optical sections collected every 10 minutes.CC-NHDF cells attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of cancer cells.A, B. Side views of 3D reconstructions of MDA-MB-231 cells (red) in Matrigel cast over NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen or CC-NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen, respectively, after 24 hours of incubation. Arrows point to MDA-MB-231 aggregates forming at or near the collagen/Matrigel interface and in physical contact with CC-NHDFs. C. 3D of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) over a 21 hour period, with both cell types tracked by analyzing the optical section stacks at 10 minute intervals. D. 3D reconstructions of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) between 50 and 60 hours of incubation. Reconstructions were performed with J3D-DIAS4.2 software.To further investigate the interactions between CC-NHDFs and MDA-MB-231 cells in the 3D Matrigel environment, we reconstructed single cells and clusters of cells using J3D-DIAS4.2. In the first reconstructions in Fig 4C, a CC-NHDF cell (yellow, 1), at the CC-NHDF-MDA-MB-231/Matrigel interface at 0 hours moved in a directed fashion (arrow) towards an MDA-MB-231 cell (red, 1) between 0 and 3 hours. At 5.5 hours, the CC-NHDF contacted MDA-MB-231 cell 1, changed direction, and migrated towards a developing aggregate, with MDA-MB-231 cell 1 in tow (Fig 4C). During that same time period, two additional MDA-MB-231 cells, (red 2 and 3), in contact with another CC-NHDF cell, moved in the direction of CC-NHDF cell 1, and by 21 hours, MDA-MB-231 cells 1, 2 and 3 had aggregated around several CC-NHDF cells, including CC-NHDF cell 1 (Fig 4C). In a second reconstruction in a later time period, shown in Fig 4D, MDA-MB-231 cells (red) aggregated using CC-NHDF cells (yellow), as scaffolds. These behaviors were observed in additional regions optically sectioned in a similar fashion in multiple preparations.CC-NHDFs penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlayIn examining optical sections, it also appeared that CC-NHDFs, but not F-NHDFs, penetrated the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay. To explore this observation, the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixtures were cast over NHDF-GFP cells treated with either fibroblast conditioned medium (\u201cF-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d) or MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium (\u201cCC-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d). DIC and fluorescent images were obtained at different distances through the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase after 72 hours of incubation. No F-NHDF-GFP cells were observed through 5 to 45 \u03bcm of the Matrigel phase (Fig 5A). However, CC-NHDF-GFP cells, were observed extending at least 30 \u03bcm into the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase (Fig 5B). After 96 hours, CC-NHDF-GFP cells (green) were enmeshed in the MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates within the Matrigel overlay (Fig 5C).CC-NHDFs act as scaffolds and penetrate MDA-MB-231 aggregates to support and facilitate aggregation.A. F-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer do not penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay after 72 hours of incubation. B. CC-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer penetrate through at least 30 \u03bcm of the MB-231/Matrigel upper phase after 72 hours of incubation. Fluorescent images were combined with phase contrast images at ascending depths through the upper phase. Cells or their projections are numbered. C. Optical sections of an aggregate at 96 hours of culture formed in the Matrigel phase of a preparation in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells were plated on the collagen substratum. The fluorescent images of the CC-NHDFs and the phase DIC images of all the cells are merged for each optical section.A quantitative analysis was performed to verify that CC-NHDF cells had a greater propensity to invade the Matrigel and incorporate into MDA-MB-231 aggregates than F-NHDF cells. An examination of 10 independent aggregates at 172 hours in preparations containing F-NHDF-GFP cells revealed F-NHDF-GFP cells in 23% of MDA-MB-231 aggregates. The average number of F-NHDF-GFP cells within the 23% of aggregates containing them was 3 \u00b1 1.8. The highest level in the 150 \u03bcm z-series at which F-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 33.6 \u03bcm \u00b1 14.3. In contrast, 100% of the 10 aggregates examined in the CC-NHDF-GFP preparations contained CC-NHDF-GFP with an average number of 54 \u00b1 15 CC-NHDF-GFP cells per aggregate (p<0.005). The average highest level in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 100 \u03bcm \u00b1 28.2 (p<0.0005).The role of PDPNBecause PDPN and FAP were upregulated at the transcript level more than nine-fold in CC-NHDFs, we assessed whether upregulation of either played a role in the acquisition of the capacity of CC-NHDFs to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells. To that end, we generated the PDPN and FAP overexpression strains NHDF-PDPN\u0153 and NHDF-FAP\u0153. We then tested whether overexpression of either resulted in activation of NHDF cells, thereby imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence in a 3D environment. After 24 hours, there was minimal aggregation of the MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a control NHDF substratum (Fig 6A). In marked contrast, after 24 hours, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a NHDF-PDPN\u0153 substratum was accelerated (Fig 6B). After 72 hours, while MDA-MB-231 cells over the NHDF cells had formed medium-sized aggregates (Fig 6C), the majority of MDA-MB-231 cells over NHDF-PDPN\u0153 cells had coalesced into large aggregates (Fig 6D). Overexpressing FAP in NHDF cells, however, did not imbue them with the capacity to accelerate (S1B Fig). To further explore the role of PDPN, we tested whether anti-podoplanin mAb NZ-1 affected acceleration. Compared to the coalescence on a substratum of CC-NHDF cells (Fig 6E), NZ-1 reduced the rate of aggregation and coalescence (Fig 6F), reinforcing the conclusion that PDPN plays a central role in the capacity of CC-NHDF cells to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D environment.Overexpression of podoplanin imbues NHDFs not activated with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium with the capacity to accelerate aggregation and coalescence, and pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-podoplanin mAb blocks its capacity to accelerate.A. Aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 preparations after 24 hours in which the substratum was NHDF cells on collagen. B. Aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 preparations after 24 hours in which the substratum was NHDF-PDPN\u0153 cells on collagen. C, D.

The inserts were overlaid with a suspension of either F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs and placed over the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase, the latter in the bottom wells (Fig 7A). The MDA-MB-231 cells that were separated from untreated F-NHDF cells underwent coalescence at a far slower rate than MDA-MB-231 cells separated from CC-NHDF cells (Fig 7B) and the aggregates were more spheroid than those formed on CC-NHDF scaffolds. Microscopic scanning revealed that no CC-NHDF cells or lamellipodia had traversed the micropore filter. The transwell experiment therefore demonstrated that, in addition to direct physical interaction, activated fibroblasts also stimulated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells by releasing soluble factors.CC-NHDFs release soluble signals that accelerate aggregation and coalescence.A.

Coalescence after 48 and 72 hours of untreated MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 plus anti-SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with rIL-6.One possible candidate for acceleration factors released by activated fibroblasts were the MMPs. The levels of pro-MMP9, MMP9, MMP2 and MMP1, assessed by zymography were 5.5, 5.9, 1.3 and 7.5 fold higher, respectively, in CC-FGM taken after 72 hours on CC-NHDF cells (lane CC-FGM/CC-NHDF) (Fig 7C) than in F-FGM taken after 72 hours on NHDF cells (lane F-FGM). A small amount of pro-MMP2 was present in all samples of FGM, but apart from that weak band, MDA-MB-231 cells did not release detectable levels of MMPs into the CC-FGM (lane CC-FGM/MB-231s) (Fig 7C). Thus, dermal fibroblasts secreted relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media. To confirm these data, we tested whether the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, blocked acceleration of coalescence using the CC-NHDF cells. After 24 hours of incubation, MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel overlaying a CC-NHDF substratum had begun to aggregate, but MDA-MB-231 cells overlaid onto CC-NHDF cultures that had been treated with GM6001 remained randomly dispersed (Fig 7D).The chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is also released by activated fibroblasts with reported effects on cancer cell locomotion and metastasis. Our Western blot analysis confirmed that CC-NHDFs released SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 into the media at levels several fold higher than F-NHDFs or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 7E). We therefore grew MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 hours in the presence of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and monitored their subsequent aggregation and coalescence in the 3D Matrigel environment. Accelerated MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence was noted after 48 hours and was quite evident after 72 hours (Fig 7F). Addition of the anti- SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb to the culture medium containing SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 abrogated the effect (Fig 7F). Finally, we tested whether aggregation and coalescence were directly stimulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by treatment with rIL-6. To that end, rIL-6 was added to the growth medium for 24 hours prior to suspending the treated cells in Matrigel for the coalescence assay. Images acquired following 48 hours in Matrigel showed no effect from rIL-6 treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells, nor was acceleration observed at 72 hours (Fig 7F).Breast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates HPMFs affecting their polarity, morphology, gene expression, ability to accelerate coalescence and MMP releaseIn order to confirm the results obtained with CC-NHDFs, we performed similar experiments with conditioned and unconditioned primary mammary fibroblasts. As was the case with the dermal fibroblasts, dramatic changes in morphologies were noted in CC-HPMFs on a collagen substrate. That is, while F-HPMFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 8A), similar to F-NHDF cells and consistent with the morphology of young, non-senescent fibroblasts, CC-HPMFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 8B). Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-HPMFs, we examined the expression of the same ten genes by qRT-PCR that we assessed in the dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, a different set of genes were upregulated in CC-HPMFs when compared to CC-NHDF cells. These included VIM, DES, FAP, PDFGRA and S100A4 while syndecan I (SDC1) was significantly downregulated (Fig 8 C). Nevertheless, when cast over CC-HPMFs, the rate of coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells far exceeded that observed with CC-NHDFs and was evident as early as 24 hours (Fig 8 D, arrows). In addition, destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer was even more pronounced (Fig 8E, dashed red line) and the area of aggregates appeared significantly greater (Fig 8F, solid red line), an observation that was confirmed by measuring aggregate areas (Fig 8G). To determine if CC-HPMFs, like CC-NHDFs, released elevated MMPs, pro-MMP9, MMP9, pro-MMP2, MMP2 and MMP1 were assessed by gel zymography (Fig 8G). Pro-MMP9 was not detectable in any of the HPMF-GM preparations while pro-MMP2 was present in all samples. MMP9 and MMP2 were only detectable in CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF while MMP1 was not detected in any of the media. Therefore, although dermal and mammary fibroblasts release different collagenase enzymes of the MMP family, both release relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media.CC-HPMFs exhibit altered morphology, altered gene expression, accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence and release elevated MMPs.A, B.

Substrate level, 10x magnification of representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen reveals advanced coalescence and considerably more destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer (dashed red line) in comparison to F-HPMF monolayer. F. Representative images of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells cast over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen at 72 hours at the 50 \u03bcm level demonstrate significantly larger aggregates over the CC-HPMF layer (solid red line) in comparison to the F-HPMF layer. G. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-HPMF cells (gray), and CC-HPMF cells (yellow). The median area of each population is noted as a gray or yellow arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-HPMFs when compared to F-HPMFs. H. Gel zymogram and quantitation of pixel intensities of MMPs in HPMF-GM directly from the bottle of sterile, unused media (no cells); F-HPMF-GM, media from 72 hour cultures of F-HPMFs; CC-HPMF-GM/MB-231, media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cultures; and CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF, media from 72 hour CC-HPMF cultures.To determine if components specific to the HPMF-GM were stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cells to secrete activating factors into the conditioned medium, we performed the coalescence assay with different varieties of media. First, in a reciprocal media experiment, we conditioned HPMFs with MCF media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 (CC-MCF). Second, we prepared a minimal MCF medium (CC-minimal MCF) by omitting growth factors and supplementing with serum that had been stripped of growth factors. We then conditioned HPMFs with CC- minimal MCF from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cells. As controls, we cultured HPMFs in unconditioned MCF and unconditioned minimal MCF. Again, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells were accelerated in the presence of conditioned HPMFs as compared to their unconditioned counterparts with obvious destruction of the fibroblast monolayer, similar to observations in CC-HPMF, with a slight delay at 24 hours in the CC- minimal MCF (S2 Fig). Therefore, secretion of fibroblast stimulatory factors by MDA-MB-231 cells is not media specific, although serum associated cytokines and growth factors, prevalent in the tumor microenvironment, likely enhance their ability to secrete these stimulatory factors.DiscussionBoth in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that CAFs and tumor cells interact to drive tumor progression, leading to several proposed models for reciprocal signaling. Given the significance of reciprocal signaling and the formation of tumors in a 3D environment, we have developed a 3D model to analyze not only signaling, but also physical interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells. We found that MDA-MB-231 cells release a fibroblast activation signal, and that these activated fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs) then accelerate breast cancer cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by, in turn, releasing soluble factors and also by serving as physical scaffolds for breast cancer cell aggregation (Fig 9). The soluble factors appear to include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and, in the case of CC-NHDFs, the chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12.A model showing how activation of fibroblasts leads to accelerated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a 3D Matrigel environment.A. Activation of NHDFs and HPMFs to CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, respectively, after exposure to a medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. B. Physical interactions between MDA-MB-231 cancer cells and CC-fibroblasts occur initially at the collagen 1/Matrigel interface but later throughout the 3D environment with CC-fibroblasts serving as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 cell coalescence. C. Release of soluble signals by CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cells accelerates coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.NHDF activationFibroblasts can be activated by a number of molecular signals, depending upon body location, developmental circumstances such as embryogenesis, tissue maintenance, wound healing and tumorigenesis. Here, we have demonstrated that medium conditioned by the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs and HPMFs, transforming them into CAFs with altered morphology, motility and gene expression, most notably, the capacity to accelerate breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.NHDF activation by MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium resulted in more than a two-fold increase in the expression of five of the ten tested genes, selected for their association with fibroblast activation. The five included PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB. Because PDPN and FAP were the most dramatically upregulated and also previously implicated in fibroblast activation, we tested whether overexpression of either imbued NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence. Overexpressing PDPN did imbue NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate, but overexpressing FAP did not. In addition, pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN antibody blocked their capacity to accelerate. These results indicate that PDPN plays a central role in NHDF activation.PDPN has been shown to regulate the Wnt/\u00df-cat signaling pathway, presumably through its interaction with ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins that link cytoskeletal structures to cell membranes. Because PDPN was undetectable in NHDF cells, we assume that the activating factor released by MDA-MB-231 cells does not function through interaction with PDPN, but rather another receptor, and that activation through the Wnt/\u00df-cat pathway results in PDPN upregulation.Suchanski et al (2017) found that PDPN overexpression in fibroblasts co-cultured with cancer cells did not enhance migration or invasion of cancer cells, but did increase the motility of fibroblasts, measured indirectly by the ability of activated fibroblasts to traverse a filter with an 8 \u03bcm pore size. Although we did not see increased velocity in our direct measurements of CC-NHDF cell motility in which PDPN was upregulated, our finding that activation causes shape changes and Matrigel invasion are consistent with their reported increased ability to penetrate a filter.Activation of HPMFs resulted in upregulation of FAP, VIM, DES, PDFGRA and S100A4, while, interestingly, SCDI was significantly downregulated. In contrast to our results, in a study by Liakou et al (2016), SCD1 was upregulated in HPMFs treated for 24 hours with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. However, we employed a different conditioning protocol and, perhaps more importantly, our conditioning period was considerably longer. Thus, the discrepancy in SCD1 expression may be attributable to fibroblast plasticity and the existence of transitional fibroblast states. The difference is quite likely due to time-dependent changes in gene expression, including transcription factor genes, in a program of differentiation. CAFs are remarkably heterogeneic and transitional states with overlapping gene expression patterns are common in the tumor stroma. The upregulation of VIM, DES, and FAP are features of myofibroblasts. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the longer conditioning period we employed may reflect a myofibroblast-like transitional state, and is consistent with the prevalence of stromal cells with myofibroblast characteristics in epithelial tumors.Acceleration by physical interactionsAlthough numerous studies have focused on diffusible, soluble factors released by CAFs, that promote cancer progression through EMT and the concomitant acquisition of cancer cell motility and metastasis, only a few have examined possible physical interactions between CAFs and cancer cells. Gaggioli et al (2007) showed that CAFs generated tracks in a Matrigel/collagen matrix into which overlying squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCCs) collectively migrated. When CAFs and SCCs were mixed, the leading cell was typically a fibroblast during collective migration of the SCCs. Pretreatment of the matrix with CAFs, followed by removal of CAFs and subsequent seeding of the SCC cells enabled SCC invasion, suggesting that during metastasis, CAFs generated tracks in the matrix that cancer cells subsequently entered. In a later study it was reported that when CAFs and SCCs were co-cultured as spheroids in a Matrigel/collagen matrix, SCC cells followed the CAFs as the cells exited the spheroids. Most relevant to the results presented here, Knuchel et al (2015) demonstrated that fibroblasts promote colorectal cancer (CRC) cell elongation and motility through direct cell-cell interactions, and that adhesion appears to be mediated by FGF-2, FGFR and integrin \u03b1v\u00df5. They also demonstrated that fibroblasts directed CRC cells to exit established CRC spheroids.Our experimental design allowed us to observe dynamic physical interactions between fibroblasts overlayed with cancer cells in a 3D environment in which each cell type was plated in its normal microenvironment; i.e. fibroblasts on collagen and cancer cells of epithelial origin in the basement membrane matrix Matrigel. Our 4D analysis of live cultures revealed that fibroblasts were able to penetrate the matrix, and by 48 hours, functioned as scaffolds for cancer cell aggregation. Movement of MDA-MB-231 cells was directional, towards and along the elongated CC-NHDFs in the process of aggregation. Aggregates enveloped the CC-NHDFs. CC-NHDF migration and scaffolding occurred as much as 70 \u03bcm above the original CC-NHDF/Matrigel boundary. In support of our findings, fibroblasts isolated from the interface zone between breast tumors and stroma actively modulated tumor cell behavior in co-cultures to a greater extent than normal fibroblasts or fibroblasts within the tumor. Importantly, the interactions revealed in our model might occur very early in in vivo tumorigenesis and may explain tumor growth and tumor heterogeneity in cases of field cancerization, a widely documented occurrence in many types of cancers, including breast cancer, in which discrete, multiple islands or foci of neoplastic cells are present within the diseased tissue. Based on an examination of 783 oral tumors, Slaughter suggested that these foci grow independently and eventually coalesce to form a tumor, a suggestion that has been more recently documented in histological analyses of melanoma development in humans.Acceleration of coalescence by soluble factors released by CC-NHDF cellsCC-NHDFs accelerated aggregation and coalescence across the filter in a transwell assay without penetrating the filter, demonstrating that the CC-NHDFs released one or more soluble acceleration factors. However, the aggregates induced by soluble factors alone were far more compact than the aggregates accelerated by CC-NHDF scaffolding. This suggests either that the mechanism of acceleration by soluble factors differs from that mediated by physical scaffolding, or that in the latter case, the CC-NHDFs caused larger but more diffuse aggregates because their presence interfered with compactness of MDA-MB-231 cells. To identify acceleration factors, we tested several molecules reported to be secreted by activated fibroblasts. First, we found that CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are released by activated fibroblasts and remodel ECM, at five to ten times the level of inactivated fibroblasts, and that the MMP inhibitor GM6001 retarded aggregation and coalescence. MMPs, by remodeling the ECM, may facilitate fibroblast and MDA-MB-231 translocation through the 3D matrix, thus accelerating the process of aggregation and coalescence. Secondly, we found that the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is released by CC-NHDFs and accelerates aggregation and coalescence. SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which has been demonstrated to affect cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, must directly affect MDA-MB-231 behavior, probably through the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 receptor, which has been shown to be expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells.ConclusionBased on the tumor cell-specific characteristics of cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment, we designed an assay to investigate bidirectional signaling and physical cell-cell interactions of fibroblasts and breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cells. We first demonstrated that tumor cells activated fibroblasts by releasing an unidentified factor. Activation appeared to involve up-regulation of podoplanin in dermal fibroblasts, which plays a major role in the effects these fibroblasts have on tumor cells. In turn, activated fibroblasts released one or more soluble signals, tentatively identified as matrix metalloproteinases and the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which accelerated the rate of tumor cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by four-fold. HPMF activation involved a different gene expression pattern but nevertheless, similar to CC-NHDFs, MMP secretion was markedly increased along with the rate and extent of coalescence in breast cancer cells. We further demonstrated that activated fibroblasts also accelerate aggregation and coalescence by traversing a 3D Matrigel environment and physically acting as scaffolds for cancer cells. We hypothesize that the reciprocal signaling system, in conjunction with the direct interaction of activated fibroblasts with cancer cells, as revealed in the 3D Matrigel environment and described here, may reflect interactions between breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts in vivo. These interactions may ultimately facilitate tumor growth and coalescence in early stages of tumorigenesis in field cancerized tissue and may also reflect cancer cell-fibroblast interactions that do not involve coalescence during tumor development.Supporting informationReferencesStromal contributions to the carcinogenic processThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerIonizing radiation-mediated premature senescence and paracrine interactions with cancer cells enhance the expression of syndecan 1 in human breast stromal fibroblasts: the role of TGF-betaSyndecan-1 in breast cancer stroma fibroblasts regulates extracellular matrix fiber organization and carcinoma cell motilityMatrix crosslinking forces tumor progression by enhancing integrin signalingMatrix metalloproteinases as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in human cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblast surface-associated FGF-2 promotes contact-dependent colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion through FGFR-SRC signaling and integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(5)-mediated adhesionFibroblast-led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cellsA mechanically active heterotypic E-cadherin/N-cadherin adhesion enables fibroblasts to drive cancer cell invasionReciprocal activation of prostate cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemnessA Computer-Assisted 3D Model for Analyzing the Aggregation of Tumorigenic Cells Reveals Specialized Behaviors and Unique Cell Types that Facilitate Aggregate CoalescenceMelanoma cells undergo aggressive coalescence in a 3D Matrigel model that is repressed by anti-CD44Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 promotes breast cancer metastasis by facilitating tumor cell intravasationThe hallmarks of CAFs in cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts induce metalloprotease-independent cancer cell invasion of the basement membraneCancer associated fibroblasts: An essential role in the tumor microenvironmentField cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium;

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

Representative images of MKi67 (C), \u03b1-SMA (D), TGF-\u03b21 (E) and cytokeratin18 (F) in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. The representative photos were taken at \u00d7 400 magnification. Scale\u202f=\u202f50\u202f\u03bcm. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

        "content": "Fibroblasts are rich in the surrounding microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because most HCCs occur in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers. However, the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in HCC metastasis remains obscure. Here, we reported that CAFs promote the migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and facilitate the HCC metastasis to the bone, brain and lung in NOD/SCID mice. The RayBio human chemokine antibody array revealed that CAFs secret higher levels of CCL2, CCL5, CCL7 and CXCL16 than peri-tumor fibroblasts. CCL2 and CCL5 increase the migration but not the invasion of HCC cells, while CCL7 and CXCL16 promote both migration and invasion of HCC cells. Moreover, CCL2 and CCL5 stimulate the activation of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway, while CCL7 and CXCL16 enhance the activity of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway in HCC cells. The neutralizing antibodies of chemokines notably attenuate the effect of CAFs on HCC metastasis and compromised the activation of Hh and TGF-\u03b2 pathways in HCC cells. In summary, CAF-secreted CCL2, CCL5, CCL7 and CXCL16 promote HCC metastasis through the coordinate activation of Hh and TGF-\u03b2 pathways in HCC cells.",

        "content": "Human breast tumors are often associated with a fibrotic reaction termed desmoplasia. Tumor cells may indirectly modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by influencing fibroblast properties. They may also directly interact with collagen fibrils leading to retraction of the matrix. We have studied in vitro the influence of various human mammary tumor cells on the proliferation rate of normal human fibroblasts and on their level of collagen synthesis, as well as their release of collagenase activity. Interactions between neoplastic cells and collagen matrix were investigated by incorporation of tumor cells in collagen gels (lattices) and measurement of their retraction. All cells tested (HBL100, SW613, SA52, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, MCF7/6, MCF7 ras, BT20 and T47D) were able to modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by one or several of the mechanisms investigated. Our results also demonstrate an opposite regulation of collagen and collagenase production. The effects on the collagen metabolism and on fibroblast proliferation are probably mediated by soluble cytokines since they are reproduced by incubating the fibroblasts in the presence of medium conditioned by tumor cells. The desmoplastic reaction may thus result from different mechanisms dependent upon tumor cell types.",

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

Non-cancerous breast lesions are highly variable, and include non-proliferative diseases such as breast cysts, and proliferative diseases such as hyperplasia and intraductal papilloma. Due to heterogeneity of breast disease, it currently remains difficult to assess whether some lesions are associated with breast cancers. Risk for breast cancers varies among lesions; for example, typical hyperplasia carries a lower risk than atypical hyperplasia. Some high risk lesions also exhibit features of ductal carcinoma in situ, or may be accompanied by breast carcinoma detected in subsequent surgery. As such, there is no uniform agreement on how to manage early stage breast lesions. To more effectively predict the outcome of breast lesions and determine appropriate course of treatment, it is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate progression of non-invasive lesions to invasive breast cancers.A hallmark of invasive breast cancers is the accumulation of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are a major cellular component of the breast stroma, and exert profound effects on epithelial cell growth and survival during wound healing and mammary gland development through secretion of growth factors, matrix proteins and proteases. Fibroblast proliferation and activation in the mammary gland is in part regulated by the Transforming Growth Factor beta1 pathway (TGF-\u03b2). TGF-\u03b2 signals through cell surface type I transmembrane receptors, which heterodimerize with the type II receptors, leading to activation of canonical Smad2/3/4 pathways and Smad independent pathways including: Rho, p38MAPK and PI3 kinase. These signaling pathways regulate the actin cytoskeleton and gene expression of cell cycle regulators, cytokines matrix proteins and proteases. The role of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in breast fibroblasts during breast cancer progression is complex. Mice with stromal specific knockout of Tgfbr2 die prior to 8 weeks of age, and exhibit defects in mammary ductal morphogenesis and increased fibrosis. Fibroblasts isolated from homozygous Tgfbr2 knockout mice (Tgfbr2FspKO) promote mammary tumor growth and invasion. These phenotypes are associated with impairment of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and increased expression of chemokines.Chemokines are small soluble molecules (8kda) in size that form molecular gradients to attract cells to sites of inflammation. Chemokines are classified into C, C-C, C-X-C or CX3C groups depending on the composition of a conserved cysteine motif. While CXCL1 and CCL2 belong to different chemokine subgroups, they both regulate angiogenesis and recruitment of bone marrow derived cells in acute chronic inflammation. CXCL1 and CCL2 signal to seven transmembrane spanning receptors expressed on the cell surface, which activate G protein dependent and independent signaling pathways to regulate cell migration and differentiation. CXCL1 binds with highest affinity to CXCR2, while CCL2 binds primarily to CCR2. Studies have indicated an important role for these chemokine signaling pathways in cancer. In animal models of melanoma and mammary carcinoma, CXCL1 regulates tumor growth and metastasis through recruitment of CXCR2 expressing neutrophils and myeloid immune suppressor cells to tumor tissues. CXCL1 also signals to CXCR2 expressing ovarian, lung and breast cancer cells to enhance cell growth and motility. In animal models of prostate and mammary carcinoma, CCL2 enhances recruitment of CCR2 expressing macrophages and neutrophils to promote tumor growth and metastasis. CCL2 also signals to CCR2 expressing prostate and breast cancer cells to enhance survival and growth. These studies indicate multiple roles for CXCL1/CXCR2 and CCL2/CCR2 signaling in cancer, which remain poorly understood.In breast carcinomas, increased stromal CXCL1 and CCL2 expression in the stroma correlate with disease recurrence and poor patient prognosis. In animal models, TGF-\u03b2 suppression of CCL2 and CXCL1 chemokine expression is associated with metastatic progression of mammary carcinomas in individual studies. The mechanisms that regulate the progression of pre-invasive breast lesions to invasive breast cancer have remained poorly understood. Here, we show that transgenic overexpression of the Polyoma middle T viral antigen in the mouse mammary gland of C57BL/6 mice results in slow growing benign lesions that progress to invasive carcinomas in a stage dependent manner. Invasive carcinomas are associated with accumulation of fibroblasts that show decreased TGF-\u03b2 expression and high levels of CXCL1, but not CCL2. Using co-transplant models, we show that decreased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts contribute to mammary carcinoma progression through enhancement of CXCL1/CXCR2 dependent mechanisms. Using cell culture models, we show that CXCL1 mediated mammary carcinoma cell invasion through NF-\u03baB, AKT, Stat3 and p42/44MAPK dependent mechanisms. These studies provide novel mechanistic insight into the progression of pre-invasive lesions and identify new stromal biomarkers, with important prognostic implications.Materials and methodsMaintenance of transgenic miceMMTV-PyVmT (C57BL/6N) mice were obtained from Dr. Harold L. Moses (Vanderbilt University). PyVmT positive animals were generated by crossing PyVmT positive males with Wildtype (WT) females. Animals were genotyped for the PyVmT gene as described. C57BL/6N female mice (8\u201310) weeks of age were purchased from Envigo. Animals were maintained under an approved IACUC protocol at the University of Kansas Medical Center under AALAAC accredited facilities.Cell cultureAll cell lines were cultured in DMEM/10% FBS unless otherwise specified. Raw264.7 cells (cat no. TIB-71), 4T1 (cat no. CRL-2539) and NMuMG (cat no. CRL-1636) mammary epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Immortalized lung microvascular endothelial cells were kindly provided by Dana Brantley-Sieders (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) and cultured in EGM-2 Bullet Kit media (cat no. CC-3162 Lonza). Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts were isolated and characterized as reported. Normal mammary fibroblasts (NAFs) were isolated from tumor free C57BL/6 female mice 19 weeks old. Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (P-CAFs) were isolated from 29-week-old MMTV-PyVmT (C57BL/6) female mice, which formed invasive carcinomas characterized by extensive fibrosis as determined by H&E stain. Mammary epithelial cells (144epi) were isolated from mammary tissues of 15-week-old MMTV-PyVmT female mice (C57BL/6), in which mammary lesions showed accumulation of stroma and appearance of few invasive carcinoma cells. NAFs, P-CAFs, and 144epi cells were isolated and cultured using methods described previously. Briefly, tissues were minced with surgical scissors, and digested overnight on ice in 10 ml of PBS containing: 5 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. 234153\u20131GM), 2 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich cat no. T3924\u2013100ml),1000 units/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich cat no. H3884), 4 mg/ml DNAse (Sigma-Aldrich cat no. D5025). Cells were pelleted at 1000 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C and washed with PBS/10% FBS 3 times, and plated on 10 cm dishes coated with rat tail collagen I (Fisher Scientific, cat no. CB 40236) in DMEM/10% FBS. To coat plates with collagen, 1 ml of 1.5 mg/ml collagen was diluted in 39 ml of 0.02 N acetic acid. Plates were incubated with 5 ml of collagen working solution at room temperature for a minimum for 10 minutes, and excess collagen was aspirated. After 24 hours, fibroblasts were separated from epithelial cells through differential trypsinization. Cells were incubated with 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin/0.54 mM EDTA at room temperature for approximately 2 minutes, fibroblasts were transferred to a 15 ml conical tube, quenched in DMEM/10% FBS, and pelleted. The remaining mammary epithelial cells were trypsinized at 37\u00b0C for an additional 5 minutes, quenched in DMEM/10% FBS and pelleted. Fibroblasts and epithelial cells were plated on 10 cm dishes coated with rat tail collagen I in DMEM/10% FBS. All cell lines were maintained in culture no longer than 3 months at a time. Cells were tested after each freeze/thaw using the MyCoAlert Mycoplasm Detection kit (Lonza cat no LT07).ImmunocytochemistryCells were seeded in a 96 well plate at 10,000/well in growth media. After 24 hours, cells were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer (NBF) for an additional 24 hours, permeabilized with methanol for 10 minutes at \u221220\u00b0C. For primary incubation with mouse monoclonal antibodies, cells were blocked in PBS containing 3.4% mouse FAB fragment for (Jackson Laboratory cat no. 715 001 003) for 1 hour. For all other antibodies, cells were blocked in PBS containing 3% FBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at a 1: 3 dilution to Fibroblast Specific Protein 1 (Fsp1) (Abcam cat no. ab75550), or at a 1:100 dilution to: pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat no. sc 8018), \u03b1\u2212smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-sma) (Abcam cat no. 7187), N-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat no. 7339) or Von Willebrand Factor 8 (VWF8, Millipore cat no. Ab7356). Pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-sma were detected with secondary anti-mouse-hrp at 1:500 dilution for 2 hours in PBS/3% FBS and incubation with 3,3\u2019-diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB, Vector Laboratories cat no. SK-4100). FSP1, N-cadherin and VWF8 were detected with secondary anti-rabbit-hrp at a 1:500 dilution and DAB substrate. Cells were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin for 2 minutes. Images were captured using the EVOS FL Auto Imaging system.Lentiviral transductionFor stable mCherry expression in cells, pSicoR-Ef1a-mCherry-Puro vectors were obtained from Addgene (cat no. 31845). To generate lentivirus, 10 \u03bcg target vectors were co-transfected with 3\u03bcg PMD2G (Addgene cat no.12260) and 6 \u03bcg PDPAX2 (Addgene cat no.12259) in HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher cat no. 11668027). Lentivirus conditioned medium was removed 48 hours after transfection and used to transduce fibroblasts two times. Transduced cells were sorted for mCherry expression by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).Soft agar colony formation assayColony formation assays were performed using previously reported procedures. Briefly, 6 well plates were coated with 1.5 ml/well of solution containing 0.5% agar in DMEM/10% FBS, and allowed to solidify for 30 minutes at room temperature. 5,000 cells were resuspended in 0.75ml 2\u00d7 DMEM/20% FBS, mixed with 0.75 ml 0.6% agarose, and then plated on top of the base agar layer, and allowed to solidify at 30 minutes at room temperature. 250 \u03bcl DMEM/10% FBS or fibroblast conditioned medium was added on top of the agar-cell layer. Plates were incubated for 14 days at 37\u00b0C based on growth of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells, a positive control. Media was replaced twice a week. Colonies were then stained for 24 hours with 200 \u03bcl of 1mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium chloride solution (Sigma cat no. N6876) at 37\u00b0C, and imaged using a dissecting microscope with an OMAX 18.0MP digital camera attachment. 4 fields/well were captured to cover the whole well. Colonies were counted using Image J software. To generate fibroblast conditioned medium, 500,000 fibroblasts were seeded overnight in a 10 cm dish. Cells were incubated with 5 ml of DMEM/10% FBS for 24 hours. Medium was collected and used for soft agar assays.Mammary transplantationWildtype female C57BL/6NHsd mice, 6\u20138 weeks of age were obtained from Envigo (stock no. 044). Co-transplantation of mammary fibroblasts with 144epi cells were performed using methods previously described. Briefly, 250,000 fibroblasts were embedded with or without 100,000 carcinoma cells in 50 \u03bcl of type I collagen overnight. C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane. A Y incision was made in the abdomen to expose the left and right inguinal mammary glands. Using spring scissors, a 1\u20132 mm pocket was made in intact mammary fat pads, under the lymph node. Using a glass pipet, one collagen plug containing cells was inserted into the pocket in the left and right mammary glands. Wounds were closed using gut absorbable sutures. Animals were monitored and palpated twice weekly for tumor formation. Tumors were measured by caliper. Mice were sacrificed 60 days post-transplantation, when control tumors reached 1.5 mm in diameter, the maximum allowable size under IACUC guidelines. Animals were maintained under an approved IACUC protocol in AALAAC accredited facilities.shRNA knockdownpSM2c retroviral shRNA vectors were developed by the laboratory of Greg Hannon, and obtained from Open Biosystems (now part of GE Healthsystems).

Samples were read using an LSRII Flow Cytometer and normalized to unstained and secondary antibody only controls.Histology/Immunohistochemistry/ImmunofluorescenceTissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer for 24 hours and processed for paraffin embedding as described. For H&E stain, slides were incubated in Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin for 1 minute and eosin for 2 minutes prior to dehydration and mounting in Cytoseal.For DAB immunostaining, slides were subject to antigen retrieval by heating under low pressure for 2 minutes in 1 M urea for CCL2, or 10 mM Sodium Citrate pH 6.0 for all other antigens. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched by incubation in PBS buffer containing 20% methanol/3% H202. Slides were blocked in PBS/3% FBS and then incubated overnight in blocking buffer with primary antibodies at a 1:100 to: Ki67 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat no. sc 1307), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat no. 9579), \u03b1-sma (Spring Biosciences cat no.

For detection of Ki67, \u03b1-sma, cleaved caspase-3, VWF8, CXCR2 or CCR2, slides were incubated with secondary rabbit biotinylated antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution for 2 hours. To detect Gr-1 and F4/80, slides were incubated with rat-biotinylated secondary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution for 2 hours. To detect CCL2 or CXCL1, slides were incubated with secondary anti-goat biotinylated antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution. Secondary antibodies were bound to streptavidin-peroxidase, and incubated with DAB substrate. Slides were counterstained in Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin for 1 minute, dehydrated and. mounted with Cytoseal. 5 images per slide per sample were captured at 10 \u00d7 magnification using an FL Auto Imaging System (Invitrogen).

For co-staining of mCherry and \u03b1-sma, sections were blocked with PBS/3.4% mouse FAB, incubated with anti-mCherry (Rockland cat no. 600\u2013404-P16) diluted 1:500, and anti-\u03b1-sma (Abcam cat no. 7187), diluted 1:100 for 24 hours. mCherry was detected with goat anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor647 (Invitrogen cat no. A-21244) diluted 1:250. \u03b1-sma was detected with goat anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor488 diluted 1:250. After a 2 hour incubation in the dark, slides were washed with PBS three times and counterstained with 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole\u200e (DAPI), and mounted with 1:1 PBS: glycerol.Scoring for tumor invasionTo quantify the extent of tumor invasion into the mammary fat pad, three serial sections per slide were stained by H&E. Using a numerical scoring system, tissues were scored in a blinded fashion. 0 indicated a non-invasive phenotype, with papillary structures, ductal hyperplasia or DCIS. Little to no stromal reactivity was observed. 1 (lowly invasive) indicated the presence of a few invasive carcinoma cells. Increased stromal reactivity was observed. 2 (highly invasive) indicated the absence of papillary structures and the presence of invasive carcinoma with stromal reactivity.siRNA transfection30,000 cells were seeded per well in a 24 well plate for 24 hours. For each well, 24 pmol control siRNAs or siRNAs targeting CXCL1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were complexed to 2.4 ul lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 ul Opti-MEM medium for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were incubated in 400 ul Opti-MEM with the siRNA/lipofectamine complexes for 24 hours, and recovered in Opti-MEM/10% medium for an additional 24 hours. Silencer\u00ae Negative Control #2 siRNA was obtained from Ambion (cat no. AM4613). 2 different CXCL1 siRNAs were generated through Ambion.

To generate conditioned medium, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 500 \u03bcl of serum free medium DMEM in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 (Peprotech cat no. 11021) for 24 hours. Media was assayed by ELISA for CXCL1 (Peprotech cat no. 250\u201311), CCL2 (Peprotech cat no. 250\u201310) or TGF\u2212\u03b2 (RnD Systems cat no. DY1679). Reactions were read at OD450nM using a Biotek plate reader.Invasion assayInvasion assays were adapted from previous studies. Briefly, transwells (8 micron pores) were coated with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD Pharmingen, cat no 356230), diluted \u00bc in PBS for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. 144epi cells were serum starved for 24 hours. 75,00 cells then seeded on top of Matrigel coated transwells in the presence or absence of: 60 ng/mLCXCL1 (Peprotech cat no. 250\u201311), 5 \u03bcM Bay11\u20137085 (Enzo Life Sciences cat no. 196309\u201376), 1 \u03bcM U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology cat no. 9903), 0.28 \u03bcM MK2206 (Selleck Chemicals cat no.

The cells were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer for 10 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 5 minutes. Cells on the topside of the filter were removed by cotton swab. The transwell filter was removed and mounted on glass slides in aqua-based mounting medium. Brightfield images of crystal violet stained cells were captured at 20 \u00d7 magnification, 4 fields per well using an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System (Invitrogen). Quantitation of tumor cells was determined by measuring pixel density of using Image J (NIH) software (arbitrary units). For co-culture experiments, 100,000 fibroblasts were seeded on the underside of the Matrigel coated transwells. CMTMR-labeled tumor cells (75,000) were then seeded on top in DMEM/10% FBS and incubated for 24 hours. The cells were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffer for 10 min. Tumor cells on the topside of the filter were removed by cotton swab. The transwell filter was removed and mounted on glass slides in aqua-based mounting medium.

MMTV-PyVmT mice bred on an FVB genetic background form in situ lesions between 4\u20136 weeks of age that quickly progress to multi-focal invasive adenocarcinomas by 10 weeks of age. C57BL/6 mice are more resistant to tumor formation; however mammary tumor development on this background has not been fully characterized. When MMTV-PyVmT mice were bred onto the C57BL/6 background, these mice formed benign mammary lesions between 7\u201311 weeks of age, with a papillary architecture, as confirmed by a clinical breast pathologist. The mammary lesions were characterized by non-invasive fern-like structures with cysts and few fibroblasts (Fig 1A). Between 13\u201318 weeks of age, lesions were characterized by increased numbers of fibroblasts, and presence of invasive carcinoma cells in the surrounding stroma. Myoepithelial cells were distinguished from stromal derived fibroblasts by overlapping expression of p63 and \u03b1-sma; fibroblasts expressed \u03b1-sma only (Supplemental Fig 1). Epithelial CK5/6 expression in MMTV-PyVmT lesions were characteristic of cytokeratin expression patterns detected in papillary lesions. By 29 weeks of age, lesions had progressed to invasive carcinomas with extensive fibrosis (Fig 1A). These data indicate that transgenic overexpression of MMTV-PyVmT on the C57BL/6 background results in slow growing mammary lesions that progress to invasive carcinomas, correlating with accumulation of fibroblasts.We analyzed the role of fibroblasts on progression of in situ lesions in co-transplant studies. Fibroblasts were isolated from normal mammary tissues (NAFs), or from 29-week-old MMTV-PyVmT mice (P-CAFs), which formed invasive mammary tumors. Mammary epithelial cells (144epi) were isolated from mammary tissues of 15-week-old mice, at early stage invasion. 144epi cells were orthotopically transplanted alone, or embedded in NAFs or P-CAFs in collagen and transplanted directly into the mammary fat pad. Because breast cancers tend to develop in adult women, past the age of 55, we transplanted cells directly into uncleared mammary fat pads of adult mice. Using this approach, we had previously demonstrated that donor fibroblasts enhanced mammary tumor growth compared to carcinoma cells transplanted alone in adult mice.Mice were monitored for tumor formation on a twice weekly basis, until 60 days post-transplantation, when tumors reached approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, the maximum allowable tumor size allowed by the institutional animal review board. Mammary tissues were harvested and analyzed for changes in growth and invasiveness of lesions. Compared to 144 epi cells grafted alone, 144 epi cells co-grafted with NAFs resulted in a small but not statistically significant increase in tumor mass and tumor cell proliferation, as indicated by Ki67 immunostaining (Fig 1B\u2013C). Compared to co-grafting with NAFs, co-grafting with P-CAFs significantly increased tumor mass from an average of 0.32 g to 0.89 g, and enhanced tumor cell proliferation by 1.9-fold (Fig 1B\u2013C). By H&E stain, at 60 days (8 weeks), 144epi cells grafted alone formed non-invasive lesions like those seen in transgenic mice 7\u201311 weeks old, with slender frond-like structures and low stromal reactivity. Compared to 144 epi grafted alone, 144epi grafted with NAFs formed thicker frond-like structures, with a few invasive carcinoma cells, resembling transgenic lesions from mice 12\u201319 weeks old (Fig 1D). Co-grafting with P-CAFs resulted in invasive carcinoma characterized by loss of papillary structure and extensive stromal reactivity, resembling lesions from transgenic mice 25\u201329 weeks old (Fig 1D). In blinded scoring of H&E stains, co-transplantation with NAFs resulted in a few lowly and highly invasive lesions. Co-transplantation with P-CAFs significantly increased the number of highly invasive lesions compared to grafting with 144epi alone or 144epi with NAFs (Table 1). These data indicate that P-CAFs enhance progression of 144epi lesions over NAFs co-grafted with 144epi cells or 144epi cells transplanted alone.As analysis of H&E stains indicated changes in stromal reactivity with co-grafting of 144epi cells with P-CAFs, primary tumor tissues further analyzed for changes in immune cell recruitment and tumor and angiogenesis. Tissues were immunostained for F4/80, a macrophage marker, Gr-1, a neutrophil marker, CD45, a lymphocyte marker, and VWF8, an endothelial marker, and expression levels were quantified. 144epi cells co-grafted with P-CAFs showed a 1.6-fold increased expression of Gr-1 compared to 144epi co-grafted with NAFs (Fig 2A). Compared to 144epi cells grafted alone, F4/80 expression was increased in lesions co-grafted with NAFs by 1.4-fold, and in lesions co-grafted with P-CAFs by 1.9-fold (Fig 2B). There were no significant differences in CD45 or VWF8 expression among groups (Fig 2C\u2013D). These data indicate that NAFs and P-CAFs enhance recruitment of F4/80+ cells and only P-CAFs enhance recruitment of Gr-1+ cells.Mammary lesions show increased expression of CXCL1 and CXCR2 over CCL2 and CCR2Previous studies have demonstrated that progression of invasive ductal carcinomas is associated with increased expression of CCL2 and CXCL1 chemokines and decreased expression of TGF-\u03b2 in stromal derived fibroblasts. By ELISA analysis, CXCL1 was more highly expressed in P-CAFs than CCL2 and P-CAFs showed elevated levels of CXCL1 compared to NAFs (Fig 3A). Furthermore, elevated CXCL1 levels corresponded to decreased expression of TGF-\u03b2 in P-CAFs (Fig 3B). TGF-\u03b2 treatment of P-CAFs decreased CXCL1 expression (Fig 3C). These data indicate that P-CAFs elevate CXCL1 expression, which is negatively regulated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling. By immunostaining, CCL2 was lowly expressed in the stroma and its primary receptor, CCR2 was expressed weakly in the mammary tumor epithelium. CXCL1 appeared strongly expressed in the stroma, and its primary receptor, CXCR2 was strongly expressed in the tumor epithelium (Fig 4). Overall, CXCL1 and CXCR2 were strongly expressed in mammary tumor tissues.CXCR2 knockdown inhibits invasive progression of mammary lesions mediated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling deficient fibroblastsWe determined the possibility that CXCL1 may signal to CXCR2+ epithelial cells to regulate progression of in situ lesions. CXCR2 was knocked down in 144epi mammary epithelial cells by stable shRNA expression to generate 2 different CXCR2 deficient cell lines (F-6, G-1). By flow cytometry CXCR2 was reduced in F-6 cells by 4.3-fold, and 4.7-fold in G-1 cells, relative to control shRNA expressing cells (Fig 5A). As CXCR2 knockdown decreased CXCL1 expression in F-6 cells by 1.3-fold and in G-1 cells 3-fold (Fig 5B), CXCR2 knockdown alone could affect progression of 144epi lesions through decreased autocrine CXCR2 signaling. To determine this possibility, we orthotopically transplanted 144epi cells expressing control or CXCR2 shRNAs (F-6, G-1) in C57BL/6 mice. At 60 days, F-6 and G-1 144epi cells grafted alone did not show significant changes to tumor growth, invasion or recruitment of Gr-1+ cells, compared to control 144epi cells, (Supplemental Fig 2). These data indicate that autocrine CXCR2 signaling in 144epi cells was not sufficient for invasive progression.Given that P-CAFs show elevated CXCL1 expression, which is negatively regulated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined the relevance of stromal derived TGF-\u03b2 to CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling in in situ mammary PyVmT lesions. TGF-\u03b2 signaling deficient fibroblasts (Tgfbr2FspKO) showed elevated CXCL1 expression. These cells were used as a model to determine how elevated CXCL1 expression and down-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in stroma would affect progression of in situ lesions. At 60 days, Tgbr2FspKO fibroblasts co-grafted with parental 144epi cells resulted in invasive lesions similar to co-transplants with P-CAFs (Fig 5C, Table 2). To determine the relevance of paracrine CXCR2 signaling to progression of in situ mammary lesions, Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts were co-grafted with control or CXCR2 deficient 144epi cells (F-6, G-1). Compared to control shRNA expressing 144epi cells, CXCR2 knockdown in 144epi cells resulted in fewer cases of invasive lesions, but did not significantly affect tumor growth or cell proliferation mediated by Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts (Fig 5C\u2013E, Table 2). Compared to control shRNA expressing 144epi cells, CXCR2 knockdown also inhibited recruitment of Gr1+ cells mediated by Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts by 3.6-fold with F-6 cells and 3.45-fold with G-1 cells (Fig 5F). Compared to control shRNA expressing 144epi cells, CXCR2 knockdown in 144epi cells did not affect recruitment of F4/80+ cells mediated by Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts (Supplemental Fig 3). These data indicate that CXCR2 expression is required for progression of 144epi cells mediated by Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts.Oncogenic potential of mouse mammary fibroblastsOur data indicated that P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts co-grafted with 144epi mammary epithelial cells enhance mammary tumor progression compared to 144epi mammary epithelial cells grafted alone or co-grafted with NAFs. However, it was unclear whether the fibroblasts themselves were tumorigenic and if they could affect normal or benign mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, we determined the purity of the fibroblast cell lines used in this study. Immunocytochemistry staining indicated that NAFs, P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts expressed FSP1, \u03b1-sma and N-cadherin (Supplemental Figure 4), mesenchymal markers typically expressed in fibroblasts. Expression of FSP1 and N-cadherin appeared slightly weaker in Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts, possibly reflecting defects in TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which regulate expression of Fsp1 and N-cadherin. All fibroblast cell lines were absent for expression of endothelial and epithelial markers (Supplemental Fig 4). By contrast, 144epi cells expressed pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial marker, and were absent for Fsp1, \u03b1-sma and N-cadherin expression. These data demonstrate that NAFs, P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO cells were fibroblastic and devoid of potential contaminating carcinoma cells.We next compared the oncogenic potential of fibroblasts with 144epi cells through soft agar assay. 144epi cells but not NAFs, P-CAFs or Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts formed colonies in soft agar (Supplemental Fig 5). 144epi cells formed fewer colonies in soft agar compared to 4T1 cells, a metastatic mammary carcinoma cell line. We analyzed the effects of fibroblast conditioned medium on soft agar growth of 144epi cells and on NMuMG cells, a benign mammary epithelial cell line. NMuMG cells treated with conditioned medium from P-CAFs, but not control DMEM/10% FBS or NAF conditioned medium showed increased growth in soft agar to an average of 1.3 colonies per 5000 cells (Supplemental Fig 6). 144epi cells showed increased colony formation in soft agar when treated with conditioned medium from P-CAFs, compared to NAF conditioned medium or control medium. Similar to P-CAF conditioned medium, Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblast conditioned medium enhanced colony formation of 144epi cells in soft agar, and induced anchorage independent growth of NMuMG mammary epithelial cells, with an average of 1.4 colonies per 5000 cells (Supplemental Fig 6). These data indicate that fibroblasts do not form colonies in soft agar; however, conditioned medium from P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts enhance anchorage independent growth of benign mammary epithelial cells.Could fibroblasts form tumors or transform the normal mammary gland, contributing to the mammary tumor phenotypes observed in this study? To determine these possibilities, NAFs, P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FsPKO fibroblasts were labeled with mCherry fluorochrome, embedded in collagen and implanted into the mouse mammary fat pad. Mice were palpated twice weekly for tumor formation, and sacrificed for tissue harvest 60 days post-transplantation. Compared to ungrafted tissues, there were no significant differences in mammary gland weight with mice transplanted with fibroblasts (Fig 6A). By fluorescence microscopy, mCherry positive cells were detected in mammary tissues, indicating retention of transplanted fibroblasts (Fig 6B). By co-immunofluorescence staining, mCherry positive cells overlapped with \u03b1-sma (Fig 6C), a marker expressed in activated breast fibroblasts. A few mCherry positive cells were \u03b1-sma negative, reflecting possible differences in the activation state and heterogeneity of fibroblasts. To determine the effects of transplanted fibroblasts on the mammary gland, mammary tissues were serial sectioned and stained by H&E. Compared to ungrafted mammary glands, fibroblasts did not significantly affect mammary gland architecture, which appeared normal (Fig 6D). Taken together, these data indicate that NAFs, P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts are not transformed and do not transform normal mammary epithelial cells when orthotopically transplanted into mice.CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling regulates invasion of 144epi mammary carcinoma cells through NF-\u03baB, p42/44MAPK, AKT and Stat3 dependent mechanismsAs data indicated that mammary tumor progression was mediated through fibroblast signaling to mammary carcinoma cells, we further investigated the role of CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling in regulating mammary tumor cell invasion. To further determine the contribution of CXCL1 derived from P-CAFs to invasion of 144epi cells, we performed Matrigel transwell invasion assays. P-CAFs were transfected with control or 2 different CXCL1 siRNAs (CXCL1 si1, CXCL1 si2), coated on the underside of Matrigel coated transwells, and examined for invasion of fluorochrome labeled 144epi cells to the underside. By ELISA, CXCL1 expression was reduced in P-CAFs by 1.9-fold with CXCL1 si1, and 2-fold reduction of CXCL1 expression with CXCL1 si2 (Fig 7A). CXCL1 knockdown in P-CAFs significantly decreased 144epi invasion 1.6-fold with CXCL1 si1, and 1.3-fold with CXCL1 si2 (Fig 7B). Control siRNA transfection in P-CAFs did not significantly affect CXCL1 expression or 144epi cell invasion compared to parental 144epi cells (Supplemental Fig 7A\u2013B), indicating the reduction in 144epi invasion was specific to CXCL1 siRNA knockdown. These data indicate that CXCL1 expression is required for P-CAF mediated invasion of 144epi cells. To further determine the relevance of CXCR2 expression to tumor cell invasion mediated by P-CAFs, control or CXCR2 deficient 144epi cells were co-cultured with P-CAFs and analyzed for invasion by Matrigel transwell assay. Compared to control 144epi cells, CXCR2 deficient 144epi cells (F-6, G-1) showed a significant 1.7-fold reduction in invasion mediated by P-CAFs (Fig 7C). These data indicate that CXCR2 expression is necessary for P-CAF mediated invasion of 144epi cells.To identify the downstream mechanisms responsible for CXCL1 mediated invasion, we employed a candidate approach, examining for phosphorylation of downstream kinases related to invasion and migration. CXCL1 treatment did not significantly affect phosphorylation of Src, FAK or p38MAPK proteins in 144epi cells. CXCL1 enhanced phosphorylation of I\u03baB, p42/44MAPK, AKT and Stat3 (Fig 8A). To determine the functional contribution of these pathways to CXCL1 induced invasion, we used pharmacologic inhibitors to block p42/44MAPK, NF-\u03baB, AKT and Stat3 activity. U0126 non-competitively binds to and inhibits MEK1/2, upstream kinases of p42/44MAPK. Bay11\u20137085 irreversibly binds to I\u03baB-\u03b1, preventing phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB activation. MK2206 is an allosteric inhibitor to AKT1/2/3. Cell permeable Stat3 phospho-peptides (Stat3i) bind to the Stat3 SH2 domain to prevent Stat3 dimerization and activation. Treatment of 144epi cells alone with U0126, Bay11\u20137085, 0 MK2206 or Stat3i did not affect cellular invasion. CXCL1 induced invasion of 144epi cells was reduced by 1.4-fold with U0126 treatment, 1.8-fold with Bay11\u20137085 treatment, 2.2-fold with MK2206 treatment and 1.9-fold with Stat3i treatment (Fig 8B). These data indicate that p42/44MAPK, NF-\u03baB, AKT and Stat3 activity are required for CXCL1 induced 144epi cell invasion.DiscussionIn these studies, we demonstrate that PyVmT overexpression in C57BL/6 mice form slow growing in situ lesions that progress to invasive carcinomas in a stage dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate an important role for fibroblasts in regulating the invasive progression of mammary lesions through paracrine interactions with epithelial cells. Our studies suggest decreased TGF-\u03b2 expression upregulates CXCL1 expression in P-CAFs. CXCL1 acts on CXCR2 expressing tumor epithelial cells to enhance cell invasion through NF-\u03baB, p42/44MAPK, AKT and Stat3 dependent mechanisms (Fig 9).PyVmT transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 background initially formed non-invasive lesions with a papillary architecture. The physiologic relevance of the papillary phenotype in MMTV-PyVmT transgenic mice is unclear. Transgenic expression of cyclin E in the mammary epithelium of mice in the B6C3F2 genetic background result in hyperplastic lesions with a papillary architecture that progress to adenocarcinomas in a subset of mice. MMTV-driven expression of c-Myc in FVB mice results in mammary lesions with papillary histology, a subset of which progress to metastatic mammary carcinomas. Transgenic expression of WNT1 also form mammary tumors with a papillary architecture. These suggest that papillary lesions in the mammary gland are common in transgenic mice.A breast clinical pathologist indicated that the early transgenic lesions resembled intraductal papillomas diagnosed in patients. Papillomas are benign lesions that only carry a low risk of breast cancer in patients. Yet, all of the female mice carrying the PyVmT transgene developed invasive mammary carcinomas with loss of papillary architecture, indicating that the papillary phenotype in mice are not stable lesions. The C57Bl/6 genetic background is tumor resistant, while the PyVmT is a potent oncogene. While transgenic expression of PyVmT on a C57BL/6 background resulted in slow growing mammary lesions, these lesions eventually progressed to invasive mammary carcinomas indicating a dominant effect of the PyVmT oncogene to mammary carcinoma progression.At this time, we cannot conclude that the lesions formed in PyVmT transgenic mice on C57Bl/6 background accurately represent papillary lesions diagnosed in patients. Yet, several aspects of the transgenic model may be considered advantageous to studying breast cancer. MMTV-PyVmT mice bred on to C67BL/6 genetic background formed slow growing in situ lesions that progressed to invasive carcinoma over time. Because breast cancers often take decades to develop in women, the MMTV-PyVmT (C57BL/6) model may be a useful model to study progression of early stage breast cancers. Accumulation of fibroblasts correlates with invasive mammary carcinoma progression, similar to a desmoplastic phenotype observed in IDC in humans. There are currently few transgenic models to mimic the various molecular subtypes of breast cancers diagnosed in women. MMTV-PyVmT mammary tumors show increased ErbB2 expression and signaling, mimicking luminal/ErbB2(Her2) overexpressing breast cancers. The WNT pathway may also be important in mediating mammary carcinoma progression tumors. In our studies, we have demonstrated that fibroblasts mediate CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling to regulate mammary carcinoma progression in this model. Profiling studies have revealed that PyVmT tumors from different genetic backgrounds such as FVB and AKXD show significant differences in predicted pathway activity. It would be interest to further analyze how CXCL1/CXCR2 cooperates with other oncogenic pathways to regulate development of invasive mammary carcinomas.in PyVmT/C57BL/6 mice. In summary, studies in this model provide mechanistic understanding of how fibroblasts enhance invasive progression of mammary carcinomas in part through TGF-\u03b2 and CXCR2 dependent mechanisms.We demonstrate several molecular and functional differences in fibroblasts derived from tumor free mice and mice bearing PyVmT mammary lesions on a C57Bl/6 background. P-CAFs enhance tumor growth and invasion compared to NAFs. Our studies found that NAFs exerted a small increase in tumor growth and invasion of 144epi cells, similar to some studies on NAFs in breast cancer. The tumor promoting activities of P-CAFs are consistent with previous studies showing that breast derived CAFs enhance tumor progression of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and PDX models,. P-CAFs showed elevated CXCL1 expression and decreased TGF-\u03b2 expression similar to other CAFs. Our studies suggest that a hallmark of some mammary carcinoma associated fibroblasts is increased CXCL1 expression, which is negatively regulated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling. P-CAFs exhibit several phenotypes similar to Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts including: elevated CXCL1 expression and enhancement of 144epi cell invasion and anchorage independent growth. While our studies indicate that CXCL1 derived from CAFs is biologically significant, we cannot conclude at this time that loss of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is necessary for the tumor promoting phenotype of P-CAFs. Further studies would need to be performed to investigate for changes in TGF-\u03b2 signaling in P-CAFs, and how these possible changes may functionally contribute to mammary carcinoma progression. In addition, it would be of interest to further examine the patterns in stromal CXCL1 and TGF-\u03b2 expression in patient samples with pre-invasive lesions. These additional studies would advance our understanding on how pre-invasive lesions progress on a molecular level, and lead to a signature to predict invasion of in situ breast cancers.Our studies show that P-CAFs enhance progression of 144epi mammary carcinoma cells in mice, corresponding to increased in vitro invasion and anchorage independent growth in soft agar. Orthotopic transplantation of fibroblasts alone for 60 days did not result in visible tumor formation. These cells were retained, but did not significantly expand. These data indicate that fibroblasts were not transformed themselves, and did not transform normal mammary epithelium within that timeframe. Thus, the mammary tumors observed in this study originated from PyVmT expressing mammary epithelial cells. Interestingly, conditioned medium from P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts induced anchorage independent growth of NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. But orthotopic transplantations of NAFs, P-CAFs and Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts had no effect on the normal mammary gland. NMuMG cells are non-transformed but immortalized. Therefore, heritable alterations in this cell line combined with fibroblasts could have contributed to the soft agar colony growth of NMuMG cells in vitro.Bone marrow derived cells including macrophages, neutrophils, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) play an integral role in regulating breast cancer progression. Here, we show that P-CAFs mediated Gr-1+ recruitment is associated with CXCR2 mediated tumor invasion. These data are consistent with previous studies indicating a tumor promoting role for Gr-1+ myeloid cells in breast cancer. While CXCL1 may attract Gr-1+ cells, the reduction in CXCL1 expression in 144epi cells caused by CXCR2 knockdown was not sufficient to affect Gr1+ recruitment. Other factors such as CXCL17, GM-CSF1 or IL-1\u03b1 may be expressed by 144epi cells, and attract and/or regulate differentiation of Gr-1+ cells in 144epi lesions. Interestingly, both NAFs and P-CAFs enhanced recruitment of F4/80+ macrophages over 144epi cells alone. Fibroblast mediated macrophage recruitment may be important in the early stages of progression of in situ breast lesions. Fibroblast accumulation was initially observed in transgenic mice 13\u201318 weeks of age during early invasion. Co-grafting with NAFs slightly increased tumor growth and invasion over 144epi cells grafted alone. Furthermore, studies have detected accumulation of macrophages and fibroblasts in in situ lesions associated with invasive breast cancer progression. It would be of interest to further investigate the contributions of Gr-1+ and F4/80+ myeloid cells in progression of in situ breast lesions.We show that paracrine but not autocrine CXCL1 signaling to CXCR2 signaling in 144epi cells is an important mechanism for cellular invasion. Previous studies have shown that autocrine CXCL1 signaling in PyVmT (FVB) mammary carcinoma cells and LM2\u20134175 breast cancer cells was important for tumor growth. In contrast to these studies, which showed high epithelial CXCL1 expression, we observed high stromal expression and low epithelial expression of CXCL1. These differences in CXCL1 expression may explain why CXCR2 knockdown inhibited tumor invasion mediated by P-CAFs, but had no effect on 144epi cells transplanted alone. Epithelial cells from in situ breast lesions may be dependent on paracrine signaling interactions with stromal cells. It would of further interest to study the functional contribution of fibroblasts to invasive progression of breast lesions.A few studies have investigated the CXCR2 mediated pathways in breast cancer. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells. CXCR2 mediated MAPK is important for epithelial to mesenchymal transition while CXCR1/2 activates Src to enhance AKT and MAPK signaling, and enhance cancer stem cell activity. In other cancers, CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling enhances growth, motility and invasion of hepatocellular, ovarian, gastric and prostate carcinoma cells, and melanoma through a common set of pathways including NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and AKT. Here, CXCL1 regulated invasion of 144epi cells through AKT and MAPK but not Src dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, we report for the first time that CXCL1-mediated Stat3 is important for invasion of mammary epithelial cells. Stat3 is more notable as a downstream transcriptional regulator of EGF, HGF and IL6 signaling mediated cancer growth and invasion. The activation of NF-\u03baB and Stat3 suggests that CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling may regulate gene expression in 144epi cells. Furthermore, Stat3 and P42/44MAPK phosphorylation appear transitory, and I\u03baB and AKT phosphorylation is sustained long-term in CXCL1 stimulated cells. It is possible that Stat3 and p42/44MAPK may act upstream of I\u03baB and AKT to regulate CXCL1 induced invasion. It would be of interest to further understand how these pathways function cooperatively to regulate CXCL1 induced cellular invasion at the molecular level.In summary, we demonstrate an important role for stromal TGF-\u03b2 and CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling in enhancing progression of in situ lesions to invasion through a genetically engineered mouse model. These studies reveal mechanistic insight into the progression of slow growing lesions with important implications for improving prognosis and treatment of patients with in situ breast carcinomas.Supplementary MaterialReferencesThe incidence and outcome of incidental breast lesions detected by computed tomographyIncidence and outcomes of incidental breast lesions detected on

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

        "content": "Fibroblasts expressing the orphan chemokine CXCL14 have been previously shown to associate with poor breast cancer prognosis and promote cancer growth. This study explores the mechanism underlying the poor survival associations of stromal CXCL14. Tumor cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis were studied in <iin vitro</i and <iin vivo</i models together with fibroblasts overexpressing CXCL14. An approach for CXCL14 receptor identification included loss-of-function studies followed by molecular and functional endpoints. The clinical relevance was further explored in publicly available gene expression datasets. CXCL14 fibroblasts stimulated breast cancer EMT, migration, and invasion in breast cancer cells and in a xenograft model. Furthermore, tumor cells primed by CXCL14 fibroblasts displayed enhanced lung colonization after tail-vein injection. By loss-of function experiments, the atypical G-protein-coupled receptor ACKR2 was identified to mediate CXCL14-stimulated responses. Downregulation of ACKR2, or CXCL14-induced NOS1, attenuated the pro-EMT and migratory capacity. CXCL14/ACKR2 expression correlated with EMT and survival in gene expression datasets. Collectively, the findings imply an autocrine fibroblast CXCL14/ACKR2 pathway as a clinically relevant stimulator of EMT, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. The study also identifies ACKR2 as a novel mediator for CXCL14 function and thereby defines a pathway with drug target potential.<iSee related commentary by Zhang et al., p. 3476</i.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484).

The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively.

The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score.
